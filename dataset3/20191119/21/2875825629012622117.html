      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm a Celebrity</a> star and former footballer <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/ian-wright">Ian Wright</a> opened up to his camp mates about the first time he met his wife - and revealed it was a disaster.</p>
      <p>He was chatting to radio presenter <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/roman-kemp">Roman Kemp</a> and boy band member Myles Stephenson about relationships.</p>
      <p>Rak Su singer Myles confessed he was always scared women were only after him for his fame.</p>
      <p>Ian advised him: “You have to go to places that are more obscure.</p>
      <p>"You can’t be going to places where the girls all like your music."</p>
      <p>He added that when he first met his wife Nancy Hallam, who he married in 2011, she had no idea who he was.</p>

      <p>"My missus didn’t know anything about football. I met her in a pub in Notting Hill", he said, revealing she rebuffed his advances at first.</p>
      <p>"It was the biggest kind of mugging off in respect of meeting someone", he said.</p>
      <p>"I’m not saying I‘m Brad Pitt, but she mugged me off so beautifully I knew she was the one.”</p>

      <p>Myles was clearly touched by the chat, and said in the Bush Telegraph: "When we was in the creek, we got speaking about our love lives and how we adjusted to fame.</p>
      <p>"Ian’s my big brother", he added.</p>
      <p>"He’s my family.”</p>
      <p>Myles wasn't the only one who is a big fan of Ian.</p>

      <p>Roman has been one for a very long time, as he supports Arsenal, where Ian played for seven years.</p>
      <p>He told Ian: “I’m not going to lie, them pulling me away from you on day one was quite tough. Especially when I know I can live in the Jungle with a legend.”</p>
      <p>He also showed Ian his Arsenal tattoo on his leg, with Myles calling it his "super fan moment".</p>

      <p>Roman confessed to Ian he had a plastic toy of him which he’d signed for him when his Dad Martin, from Spandau Ballet, appeared on Ian’s show when Roman was about seven years old.</p>
      <p>Talking in the Bush Telegraph, Roman said: “Imagine Ian’s head as a bobble head with a little Arsenal kit on, little tiny boots.</p>
      <p>"That’s what I’ve still got at home, and I’ve just said that to the man himself.”</p>
