        <b>Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements</b>
      </p>
      <p>This press release contains "forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws — that is, statements about the future, not about past, events. Such statements often contain words such as "expect,” "may,” "believe,” "plan,” "estimate,” "intend,” "anticipate,” "should,” "could,” "will,” "see,” "likely” and other similar words. Forward-looking statements address matters that are, to varying degrees, uncertain, such as statements regarding the terms and timing of the redemption of each series of Notes. Neither Schlumberger nor SLB Norge can give any assurance that such statements will prove correct. These statements are subject to, among other things, the risks and uncertainties detailed in Schlumberger’s most recent Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Actual outcomes may vary materially from those reflected in Schlumberger’s forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made, and Schlumberger disclaims any intention or obligation to update publicly or revise such statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.</p>
