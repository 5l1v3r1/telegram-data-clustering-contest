      <p><b>Best answer:</b> Yes, Disney Plus (Disney+) supports Chromecasting content from your Android phone or tablet. Whether your TV is new or old, smart or "dumb," you'll be able to watch Disney+ on it with a Chromecast. The Chromecast Ultra also supports Dolby Vision for HDR content, but it doesn't support Dolby Atmos, so you won't get 5.1 surround sound.</p>

      <p>Among the many platforms that <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/disney-plus">Disney+</a> supported at launch are the Google Chromecast and Chromecast built-in devices. This is great news because that means that it's easy as pie to switch between watching on a phone to watching on the big screen at home, even if you don't own a TV with Android TV or Roku built into it.</p>
      <p>We know that you can cast Disney+ from the Android app on Android phones, tablets, and Chromebooks with Android apps through Google Play. We aren't as sure if you'll be able to cast Disney+ from the iOS version of the app, but hopefully casting will be available from all versions of the mobile app at launch.</p>
      <h4>Common Chromecast bugs on Disney+</h4>
      <p>While casting has been a fairly seamless experiece in my personal use so far, there are a few common quirks Chromecast users have been reporting. The most prevalent issue so far has been that sometimes when you start watching a movie or episode, then stop watching before the end, the video will start at the beginning when you try to pick up where you left off.</p>
      <p>Some users have also reported instances where the stream will pause and then end, but these instances usually occur when the servers are overloaded and streaming on <b>all</b> platforms is glitching.</p>
      <p>While we know the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0157OY5EA/?tag=imoreb-20&amp;ascsubtag=UUimUdUnU59358YYw">Chromecast Ultra</a> can support HDR playback through Dolby Vision, there have been mixed results when trying to cast movies and shows that we know have 4K, like The Mandaorian. If you're seeing 1080p picture even when using a Chromecast Ultra with a 4K TV, I'd like to remind you that in order for Disney to detect the proper conditions and enable 4K playback, the 4K TV you're plugging your Chromeast Ultra into needs to support HDCP 2.2. Also, both the Chromecast Ultra <b>and your TV</b> need to support Dolby Vision.</p>

      <p>No smarts in your TV? No problem.</p>
