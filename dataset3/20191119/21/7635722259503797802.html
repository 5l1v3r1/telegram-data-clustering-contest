      <h1>Johnson, Corbyn clash in first UK general election debate</h1>

        <b>The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has claimed he will agree a new trade deal with the European Union by the end of next year if he wins the UK general election next month.</b>
      </p>
      <p>He has gone head to head with UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn in the first live TV debate of the campaign there.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn, meanwhile, promised to deliver on the results of a second EU referendum if his party wins.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson said he has a deal supported by all Conservative Party candidates - and will reach a trade agreement with the EU by the end of next year.</p>
      <p>"We have ample time to do a fantastic free trade deal with our friends and partners in the EU because we're already in a state of perfect alignment - both for tariffs and for quotas".</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn said he would hold a second EU referendum within six months of forming a Labour government.</p>
      <p>"Our government will abide by that result - I will carry out the result of that referendum.</p>
      <p>"There will be a genuine choice put before the people of Britain to make their decision, and we will carry it out".</p>

      <p>Mr Johnson made clear that he believed Britain's future relationship with the EU could be sorted out by the end of 2020 - and warned of more "dither and delay" under Labour.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn said Mr Johnson's claim that he can "get Brexit done" by the end of January was "nonsense".</p>
      <blockquote>"What he is proposing is a trade deal which will take at least seven years to negotiate whilst at the same time saying he will negotiate a special trade deal with the European Union.</blockquote>
      <p>"The two things are actually incompatible."</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson claimed his Brexit deal will allow the whole of the UK to come out of the EU, adding: "Northern Ireland is part of the customs territory of the UK. It's there in black and white."</p>
      <p>Scotland was also up for discussion, with Mr Corbyn suggesting said it was "nonsense" that there would be coalition between him and the Scottish National Party (SNP) - adding that "there would be no support for a Scottish referendum in the early years of the next Labour government".</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson responded: "I listened very carefully as I always do to Mr Corbyn - I didn't hear him say he was going to rule out a referendum on Scotland. Did you?"</p>

      <p>The two men also clashed angrily over the UK's National Health Service (NHS).</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson said Mr Corbyn's claim that the health service would be on the table in post-Brexit trade talks with the US was an "absolute invention" and "completely untrue".</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn accused Mr Johnson of conducting "secret meetings" with Washington about the NHS and a future trade deal - and produced heavily redacted papers to suggest the government was not being open with the public.</p>
      <p>He said: "What we know of what Mr Johnson has done is a series of secret meetings with the United States in which they were proposing to open up our NHS markets, as they call them, to American companies."</p>
      <p>Responding, Mr Johnson said: "This is an absolute invention. It is completely untrue.</p>
      <p>"There are no circumstances whatever in which this government or any Conservative government will put the NHS on the table in any trade negotiation."</p>

      <p>One of the audience questions was about the "nastiness in politics" that has been seen recently.</p>
      <p>The two leaders were asked by ITV host Julie Etchingham to "make a pledge" towards one another, prompting the pair to shake hands.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Asked if the truth mattered in the election, Mr Johnson said: "I think it does," a remark that prompted laughter in the audience.</p>
      <p>But laughter could also be heard from some in the audience as Mr Corbyn sought to explain his Brexit position.</p>
