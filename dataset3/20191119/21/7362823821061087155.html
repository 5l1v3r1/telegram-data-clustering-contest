      <p>This man may have just become the most popular person on the internet.</p>
      <p>A former <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/food/fast-food">McDonald’s employee</a> revealed on social media that he didn’t give customers the proper amount of McNuggets. Fortunately, this man was a generous rule-breaker and his customers’ lives were made better due to his actions.</p>

      <p>One <a href="https://twitter.com/North_Resists/status/1195499705817391104">curious social media</a> user asked, “Is there a statute of limitations on grand-theft-nuggets?” Bondarchuk replied, “I hope so because I calculated it and I would owe Ronald about $1,600.”</p>
      <p>“I got 12 in my 10-pc last week. It’s amazing how much of a gift that feels like,” <a href="https://twitter.com/of_obvious/status/1195893811123302401">posted another user</a>. “It honestly never occurred to me that this might be intentional.”</p>
      <p>Other <a href="https://twitter.com/HolTimeDoe21/status/1195757463942893569">users</a> simply called him a hero.</p>

      <p>It turns out, Bondarchuk wasn’t the only worker to be generous with the nuggets, with another <a href="https://twitter.com/Anarkeyy/status/1195703073387229184">user revealing</a>, “If it wasn’t a bad rush everyone would get five in their four-piece, seven-eight in their six-piece up to 15 in their 10pc and like 25 in their 20pc. Hopefully I made some people's days better that way.”</p>
