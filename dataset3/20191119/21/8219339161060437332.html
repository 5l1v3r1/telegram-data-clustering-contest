      <p>Apple’s hometown announced the news in a press release today:</p>
      <blockquote>The City of Cupertino will soon offer a new on-demand public transportation network in partnership with Via, a cutting-edge provider of on-demand public mobility solutions. Starting October 29, residents and commuters in Cupertino will be able to use the Via app (or phone reservation system) to hail a shuttle directly from their mobile devices, providing more efficient connections to CalTrain and increasing connectivity across the city.</blockquote>
      <p>The city highlights that using Via for the new transportation option gives users the ability to get a ride whenever they need it instead of relying on bus routes and schedules. It’s like blending Uber and a traditional bus option.</p>
      <p>Cupertino’s Mayor, Steven Scharf, shared a statement on how the initiative will move public transportation forward for the city.</p>
      <blockquote>“This partnership with Via is the next generation of what public transportation can be, allowing us to increase mobility while taking a step toward our larger goal of reducing traffic congestion across Cupertino,” said Mayor Steven Scharf.</blockquote>
      <p>For now, the program will use six “Cupertino-branded Mercedes Metris vans, which seat six passengers in addition to a driver, growing to 10 vehicles over time.” There will also be a wheelchair accessible vehicle as part of the fleet.</p>
      <p>Since the new transportation is available for both residents and commuters, all of Apple’s employees will be able to take advantage of the service.</p>

      <p>Via has previously been implemented in NYC, Washington DC, and Chicago. For the City of Cupertino, rides will cost $5. Weekly passes will go for $17 and monthly passes will be available for $60.</p>
      <p>Starting on Tuesday, October 29th, Via will begin operating in Cupertino. Normal service will run Monday-Friday from 6 am to 8 pm and on Saturday from 9 am to 5 pm.</p>
      <p>Via is a free download from the App Store for <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/via-low-cost-ride-sharing/id657777015">iOS</a> and Google Play Store for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=via.rider">Android</a>.</p>
