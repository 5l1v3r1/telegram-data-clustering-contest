      <h2>Nadine spoke about why she doesn't see her former bandmates</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T21:11:52+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 21:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/sophie-mccoid/" target="_blank">Sophie McCoid</a></address>
      <p>Girls Aloud star Nadine Coyle opened up about her feud with her former bandmates on tonight's I'm A Celebrity.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/cheryls-swipe-itv-im-celebrity-17278467">The Northern Irish star</a> was talking to GMB host Kate Garraway about being in a girl band and said that being in one is lots of fun but lots of hard work.</p>
      <p>Kate asked Nadine why she wasn’t friends with the other members of Girls Aloud or saw them. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/itv-im-celebrity-out-here-17272345">Nadine said:</a> "Everyone gets on with their lives, I was friends with them all, it was all nice and lovely. </p>
      <p>"But I was always in the gay bars with all the guys, I’d be out partying, me and ten guys, I was having a laugh, I was 18-19 years old.”</p>
      <p>Back in 2013, the girl band announced that their comeback tour would be their last, and Nadine, 34, told fans it was not something she wanted to end.</p>

      <p>She tweeted at the time: "You should know by now I had no part in any of this split business.</p>
      <p>"I couldn't stop them. I had the best time &amp; want to keep going."</p>
      <p>According to Nadine, bandmates Cheryl, Kimberley Walsh, Nicola Roberts, from <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/runcorn">Runcorn</a> , and Sarah Harding made the decision behind her back and only informed her via their management moments before the final performance of their Ten: The Hits Tour.</p>
      <p>Nadine told the Daily Mail: "I felt numb. It was shock. I definitely hadn’t seen that coming.</p>
      <p>"It still shocks me. I wouldn’t do that to a, quote, friend of mine. I wouldn’t have operated in that way if it had been in my control, but it wasn’t."</p>
      <p>But Cheryl, 36, had a different version of events and wasn't afraid of letting fans know <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/cheryls-swipe-itv-im-celebrity-17278467">when she spoke to Attitude magazine</a> .</p>

      <p>She said: "She's full of sh**. What d'you want us to say? She's full of s***. She was the one who wanted to make a solo record. Which is why we took the hiatus [in 2009].</p>
      <p>"She wants to come out and say we broke the band up? No! She shouldn't tell porkie pies. She should remember why we took the hiatus after seven years so she could go and..."</p>
      <p>She added: "OK, so do you want us to tell the truth? She wasn't going to make another Girls Aloud record until she got a solo deal. I feel she held us to ransom and then made her solo record deal.</p>
      <p>"It's the truth. She's saying that we broke the band up. So there you go."</p>
      <p>Confirming their friendship was well and truly over more than a decade after the band formed on Popstars: The Rivals , Cheryl even unfollowed Nadine on Twitter .</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Nadine focused on her own solo career but was forced to cancel a seven-date tour of the UK and Ireland in 2018, admitting it wasn't "meant to be".</p>

      <p>She said: "You deserve the best show possible and with such big venues and very little dates it was becoming impossible to achieve what we had wanted to do.</p>
      <p>"Everything is a lesson &amp; this is definitely one for me. Thank you for your continued love &amp; support!!!"</p>
      <p>Then in 2018 - despite having been a bridesmaid at Cheryl's 2006 wedding to Ashley Cole - Nadine insisted they'd never, ever been friends anyway.</p>

      <p>Nadine said on ITV's Celebrity Juice: "There was no falling out, there was just no friendship to begin with."</p>
      <p>Kimberley - who remains close with Cheryl and Nicola - agreed, admitting she wouldn't have chosen to be friends with either Nadine or Sarah.</p>
      <p>Writing in her autobiography, A Whole Lot Of History, she said: "They’re just very different from me and I don’t always understand where they’re coming from.</p>
      <p>"I suppose you choose the people you want to spend time with because they’re the people you get on with and who bring out the best in you."</p>
      <p>Those differences, claimed Kimberley, were magnified during the reunion tour.</p>

      <p>She said: "By the time we got to the actual shows, some of the old problems and niggles we had with Nadine started bubbling to the surface again too.</p>
      <p>"Nothing had really changed. There was a definite change in her, which became more evident each time she came back from LA.</p>
      <p>"In the end, I felt like there was no common ground between us."</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Nadine, though, tells a different story. She accused the other girls of being jealous of the amount of lines she got to sing and claimed it made them "very bitter".</p>
      <p>She told i News: "A thing that did cause stress in the band was the fact that I was given more lines and the girls didn’t like Brian [Higgins, Girls Aloud collaborator] as a result of it.</p>
      <p>"They didn’t like the label as a result of it, and they didn’t like me as a result of it. So it was just circumstances which were out of my control: I didn’t decide who sang what. But..."</p>
      <p>However, she insisted that despite their personal differences she would still be open to working with Girls Aloud again.</p>
      <p>And when news of Cheryl's pregnancy with son Bear broke in 2017, Nadine extended an olive branch, gushing with excitement for her nemesis.</p>
      <p>She told OK! magazine: "I haven't seen her in a long time, I really, really haven't. But I'm very, very happy for her and very, very excited for her.</p>
