      <h1>Say No! More, a Game For Anyone Who Has Hated Working in an Office</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T21:48:14+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 21:48</time> by <a rel="author">Luke Plunkett</a></address>
      <p>Which would be...nearly all of you?</p>
      <p>This is <i>Say No! More</i>, coming next year for PC, Switch and iOS. Described as “a One-Button-Game about saying ‘No!’ and a stolen lunchbox”, you don’t really say “no” as much as you blast it into people’s faces with the power of 1000 hairdryers.</p>
      <p>If nothing else, it looks incredibly cathartic.</p>
