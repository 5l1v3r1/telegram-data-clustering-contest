      <p>Apple's <a href="https://amzn.to/2KzYy5q">16-inch MacBook Pro</a> has a new lid angle sensor. The sensor was first spotted in an internal document obtained by MacRumors.<br/><br/>The site notified iFixit prompting them to take a closer look at the display.<br/><br/><i>We have to fully remove the display to investigate, but it turns out there's a new sensor facing the left-side hinge, and a magnet embedded in the hinge itself. The arrow on the magnet indicates alignment/polarity, which rotates in sync with the display.</i><br/><br/>iFixit theorizes that perhaps Apple introduced the sensor to track how much the display was adjusted and how often. This could provide data that helps determine why display cables fray.<br/><br/>Check out a photo of sensor below.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/MacBook+Pro+16-Inch+2019+Teardown/128106">Read More</a> [<a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2019/11/19/16-inch-macbook-pro-lid-angle-sensor/">via MacRumors</a>]</p>
