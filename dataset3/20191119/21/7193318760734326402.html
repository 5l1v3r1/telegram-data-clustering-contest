      <p>STILLWATER — Oklahoma State had 20 football players named to the Academic All-Big 12 team, the league announced Tuesday.</p>
      <p>OSU has had 20 or more players on the list in three straight seasons. The Cowboys’ 112 overall honorees in the past five years ranks OSU second in the league during that time span, behind only Kansas State.</p>
      <p>Of Oklahoma State’s 20 honorees, 16 were selected as first-team members, which marks the second-highest total in school history.</p>
      <p>Several Cowboys have received recognition multiple times in their careers, highlighted by Matt Ammendola who becomes just the eighth player in school history to earn four academic all-conference honors and the sixth to earn four first-team honors.</p>
      <p>Ammendola was also named to the CoSIDA Academic All-District team last week.</p>
      <p>Four other Cowboys become three-time first-team honorees in Amen Ogbongbemiga, Dillon Stoner, Logan Carter and Landon Wolf, while Brock Martin earned his second straight spot on the first team.</p>
      <p>To earn a spot on the first team, a player must maintain a 3.20 or higher grade-point average, either cumulative or the two previous semesters, and must have participated in 20 percent of their team's scheduled contests. Second-team selections must hold a 3.00 to 3.19 GPA.</p>
      <p>Here’s the full list of Cowboys on the Academic All-Big 12 teams:</p>
      <p><b>First team:</b> Matt Ammendola; Jarrick Bernard; Logan Carter; Braden Cassity; Amadou Fofana; Alex Hale; Matt Hembrough; Marcus Keyes; Carson Kropp; Brock Martin; Tanner McCalister; Amen Ogbongbemiga; Relijah Sherman; Dillon Stoner; Landon Wolf; Hunter Woodard.</p>
