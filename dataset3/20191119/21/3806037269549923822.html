      <p>Towards the end of last month, <a href="http://hypebeast.com/tags/freddie-gibbs">Freddie Gibbs</a> and <a href="http://hypebeast.com/tags/madlib">Madlib</a> teamed up with Patta to commemorate their recent Amsterdam performance, delivering a <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/10/patta-soundsystem-freddie-gibbs-madlib-bandana-tour-t-shirt">special-edition t-shirt capsule</a> to commemorate the event. Now, the close collaborators are coming together once more for another new music video in support of their latest joint project, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/6/freddie-gibbs-madlib-bandana-album-stream"><i>Bandana</i></a>. This time around, Gibbs and Madlib are revealing a M. Corey Whitted-directed visual in support of “Gat Damn.” Notably, the clip for “Gat Damn” places Freddie Gibbs at the head of his own band, with G Perico and others also appearing as members of the retro-minded group.</p>
      <p>“My last five things, starting with <i>Shadow of a Doubt</i> to <i>You Only Live Twice</i> to <i>Freddie</i> to <i>Fetti</i> to <i>Bandana</i> now — I don’t like reading raps off a paper or nothing like that,” Gibbs shared with <i>Billboard</i> during a <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8514649/freddie-gibbs-interview-bandana-madlib-mac-miller-pusha-t">June interview,</a> breaking down how has writing process has evolved over the years. “So I just really been memorizing raps and not really writing them, and it’s just straight off the head. I’ve been doing it like that lately because I feel like it’s more feeling … I think that having a more free flowing style and being more loose with my songwriting and rapping, it gives me a better feel with a beat now.”</p>
      <p>“I feel like my style is more loose the last like five projects and I’ve been perfecting that up until right now,” Gibbs added. “And also just the different circumstances that I’ve been going through just my fuel the lyrics for me.”</p>
