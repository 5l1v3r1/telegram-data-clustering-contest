      <p>Back before we had standards and practices barring tainted food from store shelves, there was a colossal stretch of history when you could buy discounted meat that was well past its best-buy date. The older the cheaper.</p>
      <p>These days, those kinds of discounts really only apply to inedible items — like cars. But you don’t have to suffer any of the ramifications of eating thrice-cooked, spoiled meats when you get a car that the manufacturer decides is no longer fit for human consumption.</p>
      <p>The Ford Flex is a model most of the folks who write for this site don’t hate. A rare breed. However, this month marks the beginning of the model’s long dirt nap. As usual, that means it’s time for heavy discounts; Ford has already been going ham trying to clear out old-stock Flexes. The deal continues to be sweetened.</p>

      <p>For November, Ford says it’s willing to lop off as much as $6,000 — a grand more than the company offered last month. There are catches, however. While you can probably find a sweet deal anywhere in the country, the biggest discounts only apply to customers making purchases of Limited models ($40,530 MSRP) in and around the following areas: New York City, Detroit, Miami and Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>It’s also not universal between them, with the hottest deals residing in the Motor City. Some of the incentives similarly specify that you buy a Ford Flex with all-wheel drive. There’s plenty of fine print but, if you can take advantage of any of it (and actually wanted a versatile, retro-inspired family hauler), there’s money waiting for you on the table.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="http://fordauthority.com/2019/11/ford-discount-cuts-flex-price-by-6000-in-november-2019/"><i>Ford Authority</i></a>, delivery must be assumed from an authorized Ford dealer’s stock by January 2nd or else the deal is no longer valid.</p>
