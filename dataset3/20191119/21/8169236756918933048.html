      <h1>Barcelona superstar exploring potential exit next summer</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T21:51:43+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 21:51</time> by <a rel="author">Jaikuran Randhawa</a></address>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10378284/antoine-griezmann-barca-exit-107m-transfer-atletico/?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=sunfootballtwitter&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1574194110">the Sun</a> via Spanish journalist <a href="https://twitter.com/eduardoinda">Eduardo Inda</a>, Barcelona superstar Antoine Griezmann is already contemplating his future at the Camp Nou just four months after his marquee move to the La Liga champions.</p>
      <p>After Griezmann’s slow start to life with Barcelona, Eduardo Inda has suggested that the attacker is already exploring the possibility of leaving the Blaugrana at the end of the season.</p>
      <p>Inda’s shocking report was based off sources in the superstar’s camp.</p>
      <p>It’s added that the Frenchman could be used in a deal to bring Paris Saint-Germain’s Neymar back to Barcelona.</p>
      <p>The Sun highlight that Griezmann being a makeweight could appeal to the Parisians as they’e been linked with a move for the star in the past.</p>
      <p>As per the <a href="https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/news/1277948/barca-sign-antoine-griezmann">club’s official website</a>, the Blaugrana spent a mammoth €120 (£107m) to bring the Frenchman to the Camp Nou.</p>

      <p>The 28-year-old hasn’t even been that bad in La Liga, the forward has four goals and three assists in 11 games.</p>
      <p>The more concerning issue is that the Frenchman has failed to register a single goal contribution in four Champions League appearances, given his marquee price-tag the star is expected to perform on a big stage.</p>
      <p>Griezmann only seems to be having issues with Barcelona, the superstar has an impressive return of 3 goals and 7 assists for France across their 10 European Championships qualifiers.</p>
