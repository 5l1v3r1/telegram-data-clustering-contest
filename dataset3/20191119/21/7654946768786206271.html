      <h1>Kurt Volker, Tim Morrison stress keeping US-Ukraine alliance during impeachment hearings</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T21:44:07+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 21:44</time> by <a rel="author">Bob Fredericks</a></address>
      <p>Ex-National Security Council Russia expert Tim Morrison testified during the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/19/trump-impeachment-hearings-livestream-watch-day-3-of-public-testimony/">House impeachment probe</a> Tuesday that Ukraine remains under threat from Russia and needs continued US support.</p>
      <p>“I continue to believe Ukraine is on the front lines of a strategic competition between the west and Vladimir Putin’s Russia. Russia is a failing power, but it is still a dangerous one,” Morrison told lawmakers on the House Intelligence Committee.</p>
      <p>“The United States aids Ukraine and her people so they can fight Russia over there, and we don’t have to fight Russia here. Support for Ukraine’s territorial integrity and sovereignty has been a bipartisan objective since Russia’s military invasion in 2014. It must continue to be,” continued Morrison, who listened in on the July 25 call in which President Trump pressed Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch probes into Joe Biden and his son Hunter as well as the 2016 US election.</p>
      <p>“I feared at the time of the call on July 25th how its disclosure would play in Washington’s climate. My fears have been realized. I understand the gravity of these proceedings, but beg you not to lose sight of the military conflict underway in Ukraine today.“</p>
      <p>Kurt Volker, the former US special envoy to Ukraine, also stressed the importance of the US alliance with Ukraine.</p>
      <p>“If we can stop and reverse Russian aggression in Ukraine, we can prevent it elsewhere. The stakes could not be higher,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I strongly advocated for lifting the ban on the sale of lethal defensive weapons or the arms to Ukraine advocated for increasing US security assistance to Ukraine and urged other countries to follow suit,” Volker said.</p>
      <p>“It is a tragedy for the United States and for Ukraine that our efforts which were bearing fruit have been thrown into disarray,” Volker said before describing how Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani had been feeding the president bogus information.</p>
      <p>That disinformation, he added, was damaging the alliance and presented a problem he said he wanted to fix.</p>
      <p>“If a problem arose I knew it was my job to try and fix it. That is my perspective when I learned in May 2019 we had a significant problem that was impeding our ability to strengthen our support for Ukraine’s new president in his effort to ramp up Ukraine’s fight against corruption and implementation of needed reforms,” Volker said.</p>
      <p>“I found myself faced with a choice to be aware of a problem and to ignore it or to accept that it was my responsibility to try to fix it. I tried to fix it. The problem was that despite the unanimous, positive assessment and recommendations of those of us who were part of the US presidential delegation that attended the inauguration of President Zelensky President Trump was receiving a different negative narrative about Ukraine and President Zelensky,” he said.</p>
      <p>“That narrative was fueled by accusations from Ukraine’s then prosecutor general and conveyed to the president by a former mayor Rudy Giuliani,” he said.</p>
      <p>Trump, he said, was highly skeptical of Ukraine based on Giuliani’s views.</p>
      <p>“The president was very skeptical. Given Ukraine’s history of corruption, that is understandable. He said that ‘Ukraine was a corrupt country, full of terrible people.’ He said, ‘They tried to take me down.’”</p>
