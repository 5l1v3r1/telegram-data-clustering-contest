      <p>Prosecutors say Teixeira killed Dr. Richard Field and Dr. Lina Bolanos in their South Boston condo in May 2017.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors say Teixeira had no known personal relationship with the victims but had once worked in the building.</p>
      <p>He has pleaded not guilty.</p>
      <p>Authorities have said they believe robbery was the motive. Police recovered a carving knife in the apartment as well as a bag containing Bolanos’ jewelry.</p>
      <p>Teixeira’s attorney has not commented.</p>
      <p>The 38-year-old Bolanos was a pediatric anesthesiologist at Massachusetts Eye and Ear.</p>
      <p>The 49-year-old Field was an anesthesiologist at North Shore Pain Management.</p>
