      <p>The anti-lynching Bills passed by the Rajasthan and Manipur Assemblies were still being examined and are yet to get the President’s consent, the Lok Sabha was informed on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Union Minister of State for Home Nityananda Rai said the Centre, following a Supreme Court directive, had issued two advisories to State governments to check incidents of lynching.</p>
      <p>“In pursuance to the Hon’ble Supreme Court’s judgment on July 17, 2018, two advisories — on July 23, 2018, and September 25, 2018 — were issued to the State governments and Union Territories’ administrations for taking measures to curb incidents of mob lynching in the country,” he said in reply to a written question.</p>
      <p>On whether a number of States have enacted laws, making lynching a non-bailable offence and recommending life imprisonment for those involved in such violence, Mr. Rai said as per information available, two Bills on the subject passed by the State legislatures of Manipur and Rajasthan and reserved by the Governor for consideration of the President had been received.</p>
      <h3>Generating awareness</h3>
      <p>“The Bills so received are examined in consultation with the concerned Central Ministries,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mr. Rai said the government through audiovisual media has also generated public awareness to curb the menace of lynching. The government has also sensitised service providers to take steps to check the propagation of false news and rumours having potential to incite mob violence and lynching.</p>
