      <h1>Most filibustered legislation in living memory back in Seanad with 78 new amendments</h1>
      <h2>Upper House votes against having legal majority on commission to appoint judges</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T21:13:02+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 21:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/profile/marie-o-halloran-7.1837472" target="_blank">Marie O'Halloran</a></address>
      <p>A renewed attempt to ensure legal representatives are in a majority on a new commission for the appointment of judges has been rejected by 15 votes to nine in the Seanad.</p>
      <p>It was the first vote in the latest debate on the controversial <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Judicial+Appointments+Commission+Bill">Judicial Appointments Commission Bill</a> which covers the process of appointing judges.</p>
      <p>The Bill was last debated in the Seanad in July and has been the subject of a marathon debate of more than 100 hours, ending with the passage of the committee stage.</p>
      <p>At the time Minister for Justice <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Charlie+Flanagan">Charlie Flanagan</a> said the Bill needed a “substantial amount of work” and has been delayed for four months until Tuesday when it was re-introduced with 78 amendments, 36 from the Government.</p>
      <p>The Bill, championed by Minister for Transport <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Shane+Ross">Shane Ross</a>, has been the subject of one of the longest filibusters of legislation in living memory.</p>
      <p>When it returned to the Upper House on Tuesday night the first vote taken was on an amendment introduced by Independent Senator Michael McDowell who re-iterated his call for a legal majority on the commission to appoint judges.</p>
      <p>He said he had never heard a good argument for a lay majority on the commission.</p>
      <p>The stress on a lay majority was a claim that having a legal majority would seek to “subvert the common good by making choices that would not be for the public good”, he said.</p>
      <p>And he said that by making the lay element of the commission a different type of person than a judge “it is more likely that such a commission would make inferior recommendations to the Government”.</p>
      <p>After Mr McDowell’s amendment was defeated by 15 to nine in an electronic vote, a walk-through vote was called where Senators moved through the ‘Tá’ and ‘Níl’ lobbies. It was again defeated, this time by 15 votes to eight.</p>
      <p>He also introduced an amendment to allow both Houses a final say after the next general election on whether they actually want the Bill to become law.</p>
