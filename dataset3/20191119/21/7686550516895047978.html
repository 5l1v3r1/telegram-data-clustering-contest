        <figcaption>Leaders debate: Care home assistant blasts leaders for 'throwing away money'</figcaption>

      <p>This was the moment a Welsh woman drew in applause from the audience at the first election debate.</p>
      <p>Tuesday night marked the first time <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> and <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> went head-to-head in the General Election 2019.</p>
      <p>The pair have clashed in the Commons since Mr Johnson took over as Prime Minister, but this time, it was on a prime time slot on <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/itv">ITV</a> .</p>
      <p>They discussed a lot of things from Brexit, to the NHS to the economy, but the audience burst into applause following a question from a Welsh audience member.</p>
      <p>During the debate Beverley Davies, from Newport, said: "I'm a care home laundry assistant earning minimum wage.</p>
      <p>"I have worked all my life and have seen the real impact the austerity which neither of you have.</p>
      <p>"Now you say there is plenty to spend, I'm concerned because neither of you have ever had to worry about money. You throw it away on silly election give-aways.</p>
      <p>"What can you say to reassure me?"</p>

      <p>Both the Prime Minister and Mr Corbyn pledged to end austerity, and each individually responded to the question.</p>
      <p>Speaking first, Mr Corbyn said: "We have had austerity for nine years in this country.</p>
      <p>"We've had a growth of billionaires in this country, we've had a growth of extreme poverty in this country, we've had a growth of personal debt from people who are trying to look after children and look after older people.</p>
      <p>"I think the first thing has to be an increase in wages by having a Â£10 an hour living wage for all people, an end to zero hours contracts and an investment strategy across the country that does give us an increase in manufacturing jobs all across Britain which we're not having at the present time.</p>
      <p>"I think this election is a turning point in the way we are going to manage our economy in the future."</p>

      <p>When the Prime Minister took to the mic to respond, he followed with: "To answer the question directly about how we're handing finances in this electoral period, I would just point out that I have shelved a plan to cut corporation tax saving - it's already the lowest in Europe - he (Corbyn) would wack it up to the highest in Europe - but we have shelved that cut.</p>
      <p>"It gives us the ability to put another six billion pounds into the NHS and other priorities and we will do that.</p>
      <p>"We can do that because we have a strong economy."</p>
