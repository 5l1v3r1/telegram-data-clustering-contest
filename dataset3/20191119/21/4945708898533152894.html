      <p>Americans rely on their mobile devices for online news far more than desktop or laptop computers, building on a trend that began several years ago, a survey showed Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The Pew Research Center report found 57 percent of US adults often get news from a smartphone or tablet compared with 30 percent from a PC.</p>
      <p>The share of Americans who often get news on a mobile device is more than double the 21 percent who did so in 2013, the first time Pew asked this question.</p>
      <p>The percentage who often get news on a desktop or <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/laptop+computer/">laptop computer</a> has remained relatively stable during this period.</p>
      <p>Younger adults are far more likely than others often to use a mobile device for newsâ€”72 percent in the 18-29 age bracket compared with 38 percent among those aged 65 and older.</p>
      <p>The seniors were more likely to use a PC for news than the younger group, by a margin of 34 to 23 percent, Pew found.</p>
      <p>The survey comes as online giants such as Google, Facebook and Apple step up with new ways to deliver news and curb the spread of viral misinformation on their platforms.</p>
      <p>The platforms have also come under increasing pressure from struggling legacy news organizations to offer a better share of digital ad revenues that stem from <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/news+stories/">news stories</a>.</p>
      <p>Facebook last month began rolling out its dedicated "news tab" with professionally produced content in the latest move by the social network to promote journalism and shed its reputation as a platform for misinformation.</p>
