      <h1>Christmas bus driven by 'Gary the Rabbit' given parking ticket</h1>
      <h2>The warden was unmoved by Gary the Rabbit's pleas</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T21:20:26+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 21:20</time> by <a rel="author">Howard Lloyd, Alexander Brock</a></address>
      <p>Families were left stunned by a traffic warden's lack of festive spirit after he issued a parking ticket to Gary the Rabbit and his <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> bus.</p>
      <p>The Stagecoach Santa coach was being used as a grotto when it fell foul of parking restrictions near a library in Exeter on Saturday (November 16).</p>
      <p>The driver of the bus, who was dressed as a giant rabbit, pleaded with the warden who remained unmoved.</p>
      <p>One mum said he was even forced to remove his bunny head in front of the children as the Penalty Charge Notice was slapped on the festive bus.</p>
      <p>"He tried to explain that it's a planned event but the parking officer kept saying that he's just doing his job," Gosia Bartram said.</p>
      <p>"I was there with my little boy.</p>
      <p>"The bus outside library was turned into a grotto. The driver is the one dressed as a bunny.</p>
      <p>"They also made the driver dressed as a bunny take the head off in front of the children."</p>
      <p>Devon County Council said no efforts had been made to contact them in advance of the event, and 'suitable parking arrangements could have been made' had they done so.</p>

      <p>A spokesperson said: “One of our parking enforcement officers issued a penalty charge notice (PCN) to a bus parked in an area of Rougemont Place, outside the library, where parking is not permitted.</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately, we hadn’t received notification of this event in advance, otherwise suitable parking arrangements could have been made for the vehicle.”</p>
      <p>The Stagecoach Santa bus is heading to Barnstaple Carnival on Thursday (November 28) and Children's Hospice South West on Thursday (December 12).</p>
      <p>Stagecoach have been contacted for comment.</p>
