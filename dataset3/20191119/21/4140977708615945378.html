          </p>
          <p>Languishing and regressing, for both Portland Trail Blazers and New Orleans Pelicans, the ongoing edition of NBA has been a dire and chastening one. Both sit in the deaths of the Western Conference, failing to string together two meaningful displays, an impasse either know they need to wench out of at the earliest.</p>
          <p>For Portland Trailblazers who find themselves in 12th position in the conference with a mere five wins from 14 matches, today’s encounter comes as an excellent opportunity to show their true mettle and put in an instrumental display which could end up adding massive impetuous to their season. Not only are they up against a floundering New Orleans Pelicans side but are taking on a team who have been stricken by injuries, a depleted and bludgeoned side for whom the perils have no chance of seizing.</p>

                <p>What will buoy New Orleans Pelicans though ahead of today’s imminent outing is the fact that the side managed to get to what was only their fourth win in 13 contests the last time around as they outshone GSW to win 108-100. Elsewhere Portland Trail Blazers were routed and thumped by Houston Rockets in the foregone clash with the side being putdown 132-108 in what was a horrid showing, one which brought to light their defensive aberrations.</p>

                              <b>New Orleans Pelicans</b>

                            </ul>
                            <h3>NOP Vs POR Dream11 Point Guard</h3>
                            <p>If Portland Trail Blazers are to win in this one, they’ll be requiring their leading points getter, Damian Lillard to be at the forefront of their game and take charge for the side today. The player has undoubtedly been the most succulent and tenacious performer in the side, pulling off an incredible 28.6 points and 7.1 assists per encounter, a tally he is bound to add to against a dwindling defence come today.</p>
                            <h4>NOP Vs POR Dream11 Shooting Guard </h4>
                            <p>The two players will be forming this facet of our team’s side with us beginning with Rodney Hood from Portland Trail Blazers. The player has returned from injury and once again become an integral part of his team’s component with his innate ability to open up the zone and send down treys making him an integral part of his side’s composition.</p>
                            <p>From the opposition meanwhile we have decided to indulge in E’Twaun Moore. At a time when his side are reeling with a spate of injuries, the shooting guard’s responsibilities will increase in magnitude and up against a defensive unit who can all too easily be battered, the player is bound to add on the points today.</p>
                            <h3>NOP Vs POR Dream11 Small Forward</h3>
                            <p>The most heavily decked up unit of our Dram 11 side, we have decided to venture in with three players over with a two of them coming in from the visiting side itself. Kent Bazemore and Nassir Little forming this side of our team. Both players come imbued with a vast versatile skill set, one which will see them not only drop treys but also move inside the paint to be on the end of layups and use their scrimmages to fruitful effect for the side.</p>
                            <p>Just the lone pick for us from New Orleans Pelicans meanwhile with Kenrich Williams being our only selection for this slot.</p>
                            <h3>NOP Vs POR Dream11 Power Forward</h3>
                            <p>A slew of injuries to the home side mean Nicolo Melli’s role as a player is going to grow in stature for the side and be accorded with an elevated role for his outfit. The player is going to play a dual toned role for his outfit today, one which will see him be heavily involved under his side’s post and pull of deflections on a consistent rate.</p>
                            <h3>NOP Vs POR Dream11 Centre</h3>
                            <p>Jaxson Hayes will be handed over an akin role to Melli, seeing us get him in as well from New Orleans Pelicans to wrap up proceedings for today’s impending encounter.</p>
                            <h3>Star Player</h3>
                            <p>Little hesitations in deciding to induct Lillard as our star player for the day.</p>
