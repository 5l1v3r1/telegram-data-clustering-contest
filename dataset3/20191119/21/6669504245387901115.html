      <p>Two suspects fleeing police in the South Okanagan were nabbed, thanks in part, to the efforts of police service dog Haro.</p>
      <p>RCMP officers from the Targeted Enforcement Unit in Penticton saw a woman they knew was prohibited from driving in the driver’s seat of a car with a stolen licence plate at around 11 a.m. Nov. 14, according to an RCMP media release.</p>
      <p>A man in the passenger seat was also recognized as recently released from jail with a condition not to be in a motor vehicle. The two fled in the vehicle upon seeing police.</p>
      <p>The vehicle was later located in Oliver where officers followed it from a distance as it travelled south to Osoyoos.</p>
      <p>After taking a back road in an effort to elude police, the vehicle became stuck in the sand and the occupants fled the scene south along the shore of Osoyoos Lake.</p>
      <p>Several officers attended the scene, along with police dog Haro. Following a lengthy search, the police dog and handler Cpl. Jason Goodfellow located the two, who were hiding in bushes.</p>
      <p>Shane Pope, 29, of Penticton faces one count of breach while Connie Clark, 27, of Oliver has been charged with flight from police, dangerous driving and driving while prohibited.</p>
      <p>“The great work and coordinated efforts of the South Okanagan regional detachments and Haro were paramount in this incident ending with the arrest and charges, and no injuries,” Osoyoos RCMP Sgt. Jason Bayda said the release.</p>
