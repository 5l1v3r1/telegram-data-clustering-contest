      <p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday">Black Friday</a> is happening on Friday, November 29th, but if you shop on that day only, you’ll probably miss out on some great deals.

How much are you looking to spend? Will you be shopping online, or are you willing to make the trek to your local store? These are all good things to think about, and we’ll keep the info below updated to help make shopping on Black Friday easier.</p>
