      <p>Ten Democrats voted against the bill and 12 Republicans voted with the Democrats to push the bill on to the Senate.</p>
      <p>President Donald Trump is expected to sign the bill if it passes in the Senate, which is expected.</p>
      <p>“This is what we need: A CR, as clean as possible, through Dec. 20, to enable more progress on appropriations before the end of the year,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said. “A clean CR through Dec. 20 would pass the Senate.” </p>
      <p>“And the White House has indicated President Trump would sign it,” McConnell said.</p>
      <p>This is the second CR since the fiscal year began Oct. 1.</p>
