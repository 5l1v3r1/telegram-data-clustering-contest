      <h1>UK-bound ship returns to Netherlands after 25 migrants found onboard</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T21:00:41+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 21:00</time> by <a rel="author">EuronewsÂ </a></address>
      <p>At least 25 migrants have been found stowed away in a UK-bound ferry on Tuesday, Dutch police said.</p>
      <p>The migrants were discovered aboard the Britannia Seaways cargo ferry after it had already left the Dutch port of Vlaardingen, prompting the vessel to return to its point of departure.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.rijnmondveilig.nl/incidenten/inzet-hulpdiensten-vulcaanhaven-vlaardingen/">Police said</a> the migrants had been hiding in a refrigerated container and that they are receiving medical care.</p>
      <p>The origins of the migrants is not known, and images of the stowaways being led to busses show mainly young men.</p>
      <p>Police told Dutch national broadcaster NOS that they had detained the driver and he was being questioned over his possible involvement in human trafficking.</p>
      <p>The ferry had just embarked on a run across the North Sea to Felixstowe in southern England.</p>
      <p>The discovery comes a month after <a href="https://www.euronews.com/2019/10/26/vietnam-pm-orders-probe-into-allegations-vietnamese-citizens-were-among-39-people-found-de">39 Vietnamese migrants</a> were found dead in a refrigerated truck near London.</p>
