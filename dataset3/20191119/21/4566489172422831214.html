      <h1>Hitler birth house in Austria to become police station</h1>

      <p>The house where Adolf Hitler was born will be turned into a police station, Austria's interior ministry announced Tuesday, after years of legal wrangling as the government looks to prevent the building from becoming a neo-Nazi shrine.</p>
      <p>The yellow corner house in the northern town of Braunau on the border with Germany, where Hitler was born on April 20, 1889, was taken into government control in 2016.</p>
      <p>But the destiny of the building was subject to a lengthy legal battle with the family of Gerlinde Pommer, which owned the house for nearly a century.</p>
      <p>That only ended this year when the country's highest court ruled on the compensation Pommer would receive.</p>
      <p>The interior ministry will now invite submissions from architects to have the building house the town's police force.</p>
      <p>"The house's future usage by the police should set a clear signal that this building will never be a place to commemorate Nazism," Interior Minister Wolfgang Peschorn said in a press release.</p>
      <p>The EU-wide architecture competition will be launched this month with a jury of experts, including a representative of the town, expected to make a decision on the best design in the first half of next year.</p>
      <p>Austria's highest court ruled earlier this year that Pommer was entitled to some 810,000 euros ($900,000) in compensation, less than she had sought but still more than she had been originally offered.</p>
      <p>Pommer had been renting the 800-square-metre (8,600-square-feet) property -- which also has several garages and parking spaces located behind the main building -- to the interior ministry since the 1970s.</p>
      <p>The government paid her around 4,800 euros a month and used it as a centre for people with disabilities.</p>
      <p>But this arrangement fell apart in 2011 when Pommer refused to carry out essential renovation work and also declined to sell it.</p>
      <p>Since then, the building has lain empty.</p>
      <p>At one point, the interior ministry was pushing to have it torn down but the plans ran into angry resistance from politicians and historians.</p>
      <p>Although Hitler only spent a short time at the property, it continues to draw Nazi sympathisers from around the world.</p>
      <p>Every year on Hitler's birthday, anti-fascist protesters organise a rally outside the building.</p>
