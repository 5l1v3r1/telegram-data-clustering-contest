      <p>What happened in Kogi during the recently held governorship election can best be described as horror and has traumatised Nigerians, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has claimed.</p>
      <p>The PDP made the claim in a statement in the evening of Tuesday, November 19, accusing the chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Mahmood Yakubu, and the Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Mohammed Adamu, of allegedly playing roles in how the election went.</p>
      <p>The statement by its national spokesperson, Kola Ologbondiyan, noted that the National Working Committee (NWC) of the PDP has decided that the alleged rigging of the election in the state as well as Bayelsa would not stand.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The party said it would not fold its arms and keep silent over the alleged stealing of the mandate given by the people of Kogi to Musa Wada, its candidate in Kogi, and Senator Douye Diri in Bayelsa.</p>
      <p><i>"Indeed, the nation is still at shock over the brazen show of violence, where security forces coordinated the invasion of polling units, shooting and killing of voters and carting away of ballot boxes to government facilities where results were altered and fictitious figures given to INEC to declare the APC candidates as winners," </i>the PDP alleged.</p>
      <p>It said further: <i>"Nigerians watched with horror as APC thugs and security forces traumatized and held voters hostage, murdered our compatriots, injured and maimed many more in violent attacks that involved the deployment of police helicopters."</i></p>
      <p>The party said at the appropriate time, it would expose the roles allegedly played by those it claimed played roles in the violence and rigging that reportedly characterised the election.</p>

        <i>"The irreversible fact remains that though evil may appear to thrive for a while, truth and justice will always prevail at the end.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>"The APC and its candidates must bear in mind that what they could not get through the ballot box, they cannot get by violence, manipulation and killing,"</i> the party said.</p>
      <p>The PDP promised to file what it called legitimate actions against identified INEC and security officials who allegedly aided the APC in the violent rigging of the election.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, the party has mourned its women leader, Acheju Abuh, reported to have been burnt by thugs</p>
      <p><i>"While invoking the wrath of God on the perpetrators of the gruesome killings, the party calls on the police to immediately track down and bring their killers to book,"</i> the PDP said.</p>
      <p>Though the police is yet to officially react to the allegation, Legit.ng reported that Mohammed Adamu, head of the law enforcement agency in the country, said the helicopter which dropped teargas during the election <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1277207-kogi-election-igp-adamu-explains-helicopter-dropped-teargas-poll.html">was deployed for crime prevention during the election</a>.</p>
