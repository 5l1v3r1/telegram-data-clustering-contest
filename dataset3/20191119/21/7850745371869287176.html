      <h1>URA needs government support in this digital era</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T21:52:59+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 21:52</time> by <a rel="author">Editorial</a></address>
      <p>Uganda Revenue Authority (URA) needs all the support of government to modernise tax administration and revenue mobilisation in this era of digital revolution.</p>
      <p>The minister of Finance, Matia Kasaija, is worried that the fast growth of technology has inevitably contributed to the revenue shortfalls. Kasaija expressed his concerns while addressing the African Tax Administration Forum (ATAF) yesterday at Serena hotel, Kampala.</p>
      <p>The theme of the ATAF conference was “Innovations- Digalisation and Harnessing Technology to Improve Tax Administration.”</p>
      <p>The minister is right to get concerned as every day new businesses are conducted in virtual space or electronically and some of the revenue from sales has been slipping through Uganda due to lack of appropriate policies and tax laws.</p>
      <p>Most of the laws governing tax administration such as the Income Tax Act have not been adjusted to march the emerging transactions in the digital world. For instance, the Income Tax Act does empower URA to either withdraw some tax from a person who has made purchases over the internet or any virtual forum registered in a foreign country with several branches.</p>
      <p>Government ought to help URA in tax policy formulation and law enactment. The targets imposed on URA are huge and yet much of their success depends on the tax policies and laws in place.</p>
      <p>Tax is a compulsion of the law; URA cannot collect tax outside the law. Yet the work of making laws is a preserve of parliament and the executive.</p>
      <p>For instance, it is government that signs the double taxation treaties which in many instances have been abused by the multinationals to the detriment of Uganda’s revenue collection efforts. The investment treaties are entered between the government and the investors, and government eventually ratifies them.</p>
      <p>When ratified, they become part of the domestic laws and the character and nature of treaties have an impact on tax administration. Therefore, if government and parliament enact laws that are not in tandem with the fast-moving digital era, it means the implementers would only be able to collect only that which is spelt out in the law.</p>
      <p>However, the laws that might be enacted by parliament should avoid stifling digital innovations. One such law is the Over the Top tax, commonly known as social media tax.</p>
      <p>Prior to enactment of this law, the rural folk had steadily embraced digital commerce through transactions conducted over mobile money.</p>
      <p>The levies, that were imposed as a consequence of these laws discouraged people from the trade. Therefore, care must be taken when enacting the laws. Tax should not be regarded as punitive and counterproductive. <i>The Observer</i> would like to wish the council of African Tax Administration Forum (ATAF) a happy 10th anniversary.</p>
