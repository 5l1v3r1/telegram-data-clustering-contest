      <h1>Crisis on Infinite Earths Episode 2 Pics Reveal Kevin Conroy’s Bruce Wayne</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T21:32:55+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 21:32</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Abbate</a></address>
      <p>The CW continues to share even more images from its highly anticipated <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/crisis-on-infinite-earths"><b>Crisis on Infinite Earths</b> </a>event. Via <a href="https://ew.com/tv/2019/11/19/batwoman-crisis-on-infinite-earths-photos/?utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=entertainmentweekly_ew&amp;utm_content=link&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_term=74462888-0AFD-11EA-9C56-41904744363C&amp;__twitter_impression=true&amp;__twitter_impression=true">Entertainment Weekly</a>, the network has graced us with nine new stills ahead of the crossover’s December 8 debut. One of the pictures even features our first look at Kevin Conroy’s older Bruce Wayne.</p>
      <p>For nearly 30 years, Conroy has provided Batman’s voice in DC’s animated universe, with many hailing him as the definitive Dark Knight actor. However, his role in <b>Crisis</b> marks the first time he has played the character in live-action. The new image also confirms that he’s playing the <b>Kingdom Come</b> iteration of Batman. In that story, Bruce wore a mechanical exo-skeleton that allowed him to keep some measure of strength and agility in his old age.</p>
      <p>This latest assortment of photos also features new looks at Brandon Routh as the <b>Kingdom Come</b> Superman. Additionally, we see a shot of Routh as Clark Kent next to a framed copy of The Daily Planet. The issue details a gas attack at the newspaper’s offices, which <b>Kingdom Come</b> readers will remember as the Joker’s handiwork. This attack took many lives, including that of Lois Lane.</p>

      <p>Other stills include new glimpses at Tyler Hoechlin’s Superman and Ruby Rose out of costume as Kate Kane. We also see Hoechlin’s Clark Kent, Elizabeth Tulloch’s Lois Lane, and Candice Patton’s Iris West gathered at Kent Farm. They’re presumably visiting Tom Welling’s version of Clark, who once again dons his familiar plaid garb from his <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/smallville"><b>Smallville</b></a> days.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/supergirl"><b>Supergirl</b></a> will kick off <b>Crisis on Infinite Earths</b> on Sunday, December 8. The second part will unfold in <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/batwoman"><b>Batwoman</b></a> on Monday, December 9.
