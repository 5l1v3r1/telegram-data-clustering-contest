      <p>Cirque du Soleil is coming back to Kamloops and Kelowna next year with an even more impressive show — on ice.</p>
      <p>The show, dubbed Cirque du Soleil AXEL, will focus on the character Axel, who is travelling with his band and performing original pieces throughout the show. Axel finds himself falling in love with a character named Lei while the two attempt to retrieve the light that was stolen by a super villain named Vï.</p>
      <p>According to a media release, having the show on ice will put a focus on the impressive work of freestyle, pair, and solo skating, which is a new take on the traditional Cirque du Soleil performances.</p>
      <p>In Kelowna, the show takes over Prospera Place from June 11 to 14, 2020. The show in Kamloops is at the Sandman Centre from June 18 to 21, 2020.</p>
