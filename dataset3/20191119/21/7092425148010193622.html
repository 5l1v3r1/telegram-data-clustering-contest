      <p>A bizarre mash-up of Marvel meets The Irishman was revealed on the Jimmy Kimmel Live show. It's now doing the rounds online.</p>
      <p>The spoof, featuring heavily around Iron Man, sees Martin Scorsese's creation turned into a stereotypical view of the Irish. Did they have to include the leprechaun? Seriously?</p>
      <p>The video starts off as normal before Marvel's usual opening theme quickly appears on the screen.</p>
      <p>Viewers can see Robert De Niro's character using a glowing shamrock ring which transforms him into a super hero "Irish Man".</p>

      <p>The clip, created by the team behind Jimmy Kimmel Live, is inspired by Scorsese's comments that Marvel movies are not cinema. Instead, the filmmaker likened Marvel to theme parks.</p>
      <p>To ease some of the ever growing tension, Kimmel joked that the video is "the world premiere trailer for the first ever collaboration between Marvel and Scorsese."</p>

        <i>The Irishman is currently in cinemas and arrives to Netflix on November 27</i>
