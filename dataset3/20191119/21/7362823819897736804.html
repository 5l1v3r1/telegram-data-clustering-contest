      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/travel/vacation-destinations/chicago">Chicago</a> went more than a full day without one reported shooting-- from Sunday night into early Tuesday.</p>
      <p>There were no reported gunshot victims from 10:02 p.m. Sunday until 12:43 a.m. Tuesday, according to Chicago Sun-Times and Chicago police records.</p>
      <p>Fourteen people were shot Sunday, the last of which was a 17-year-old on the southwest side. The boy was inside a vehicle around 10 p.m. when an SUV approached and someone inside fired shots, striking the boy in the leg. He was taken to a hospital and is in good condition.</p>

      <p>About 26 hours later, a 15-year-old boy was walking and heard gunfire. He was shot in the lower back and remains in serious condition.</p>
      <p>The last time Chicago went so long <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/chicagos-crime-wave">without a reported shooting</a> was on March 21, when the city recorded 28 hours without a shooting victim, according to <a href="https://wbbm780.radio.com/articles/chicago-goes-1-day-without-shooting">WBBM Radio</a>.</p>
      <p>The first day Chicago did not report a shooting in 2019 was Jan. 14.</p>

      <p>Chicago police said that as of the 12:42 a.m. shooting on Tuesday, there have been 1,924 shootings in the city in 2019 and 450 people have been killed as a result of gun violence, according to <a href="https://graphics.suntimes.com/homicides/">Sun-Times records</a>.</p>
      <p>Murders and shootings reported last month in Chicago<a href="https://chicago.suntimes.com/crime/2019/11/1/20943132/monthly-crime-stats-october-shootings-homicide-gun-violence-chicago-police"> were down</a> from October 2018. There were 38 murders reported in October, a 20% decrease from this time last year, and shootings were down 6.2 percent.</p>
      <p>“While we will never allow ourselves to become complacent in combating violence throughout our city, we’re encouraged to see our vision for a safer Chicago materialize,” Police Supt. Eddie Johnson said.</p>
      <p>At the same time, 9,300 illegal guns were seized by police in 2019 as of Nov. 1. That’s a 19 percent increase from the same period last year.</p>
