      <h1>'Show me how good you are' - Ngani Laumape's random recruitment pitch to pro players</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T21:12:34+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 21:12</time> by <a rel="author">Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>Hurricanes and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/new-zealand">All Blacks</a> star <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/hurricanes/players/ngani-laumape/">Ngani Laumape</a> has taken to Twitter to recruit for his home town Mitre 10 province <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/mitre-10-cup/teams/manawatu">Manawatu</a> in an unconventional and unusual fashion.</p>
      <p>The bulldozing second five missed out on World Cup selection and spent the rest of the season tormenting <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/mitre-10-cup">Mitre 10 Cup</a> sides with breakaway performances for his Turbos outfit, showing the All Blacks just what they had missed out on.</p>

      <p>Now the former NRL star has laid down the challenge for other players to ‘come play for a small town like Manawatu’ instead of ‘hiding behind the bigger cities’.</p>

      <p>It is difficult to determine who exactly Ngani’s message is meant for, but the centre wants others to ‘show me how good you are’ playing for a smaller provincial region.</p>
      <p>His message was met with a response from fans and pro players alike with former All Black and current Wasps’ flyhalf <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/wasps/players/lima-sopoaga/">Lima Sopoaga</a> replying with ‘Stagnation’.</p>

      <p>After one punter suggest Laumape isn’t good enough for the big city teams despite Laumape playing for his country and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby">Super Rugby</a> with a franchise in New Zealand’s second-biggest city, teammate <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/hurricanes/players/ardie-savea/">Ardie Savea</a> labeled the assertion the ‘joke of the year’.</p>

      <p>Laumape has publicly dealt with his World Cup omission admirably by returning to the Turbos and playing out the season without any fuss despite the circumstances.</p>
      <p>The Turbos made the Championship semi-finals before coming undone by <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/mitre-10-cup/teams/bay-of-plenty">Bay of Plenty</a> in a lop-sided match.</p>
      <p>With <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby">Super Rugby</a> just around the corner, Laumape will soon be pushing for an All Black re-call with <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/blues/players/sonny-bill-williams/">Sonny Bill Williams</a> and <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/super-rugby/teams/crusaders/players/ryan-crotty/">Ryan Crotty</a> moving offshore after the World Cup.</p>
      <p>It’s unknown yet whether Laumape’s recruitment pitch will help the Turbos bring any new players to the Manawatu for next season.</p>
