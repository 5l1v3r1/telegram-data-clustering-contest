      <p>A man was arrested after deadly beating and robbery in Phoenix on Monday.</p>
      <p>According to Phoenix police, officers responded to an injured person seen in bushes south of a <a href="https://www.abc15.com/news/region-phoenix-metro/central-phoenix/pd-man-arrested-following-homicide-investigation-near-16th-street-and-roosevelt">business near 16th and Roosevelt streets around 6 a.m.</a></p>
      <p>A customer alerted a Circle K clerk to a man who appeared to be dead in the bushes along with another man lying next to him, "pretending to be asleep," and contacted the police.</p>
      <p>Officers found 67-year-old Oscar Guzman unresponsive with signs of trauma to his body.</p>
      <p>The Phoenix Fire Department responded and declared Guzman deceased. Police say Guzman was covered in blood on his face, arms, and clothes. He also had "multiple fractures of the face."</p>
      <p>Another man, later identified as 42-year-old Hector Zamarripa, was located near Guzman, also covered in blood and detained for questioning.</p>
      <p>Zamarripa admitted to detectives that he was allegedly responsible for Guzman's death, saying he was cold so he stole Guzman's shirt and ring.</p>
      <p>Court records show that Zamarripa admitted to punching Guzman in the groin several times but doesn't remember any other details of the beating.</p>
      <p>Zamarripa is being held on a $500,000 cash bond on a charge of second-degree murder.</p>
