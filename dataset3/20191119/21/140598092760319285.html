      <h1>Russell Group universities now use interviews simply as a marketing opportunity, says headteacher</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T21:19:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 21:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/camilla-turner/" target="_blank">Camilla Turner</a></address>
      <p>Russell Group universities are now using interviews as a marketing opportunity rather than as a way to pick the best candidates, a leading headteacher has said.</p>
      <p>Previously, only tutors selecting candidates for competitive courses at the most selective institutions would invite students for an interview.</p>
      <p>But now it is the universities that are “struggling to fill places” that ask pupils to come for an interview as a way to “entice” them into selecting it as their first choice.</p>
      <p>Liz Hewer, headmistress at school St George’s Ascot, said: “If you get asked for interview you are going to say yes if it’s one of your five choices. But it definitely feels, from the feedback from the pupils, like a marketing day.”</p>
      <p>“It’s ‘come and have a look and meet us, we have an opportunity to show you what a great place this is as well as having an interview’.</p>
      <p>“Whereas in the past it would only really be for the very competitive courses or particular subjects like medicine which would require an interview.”</p>
      <p>St George’s Ascot, which costs £36,525-a-year for boarders, was founded in 1877 as a boys’ preparatory school and its alumni include the former Prime Minister Winston Churchill. It later became an all-girls’ school and counts Princess Beatrice among its more recent former pupils.</p>
      <p>Since the lifting of the cap on numbers in 2015, many universities have rapidly expanded and are now competing with each other to recruit as many students as possible.</p>
      <p>Universities have also been criticised for using “incentivised” unconditional offers to effectively bribe students into choosing them as their first choice.</p>
      <p>The number of unconditional offers has risen sharply in recent years, with students now 30 times more likely to receive one than five years ago.</p>
      <p>Fierce competition between universities to attract students has seen sixth form pupils increasingly offered places regardless of their exam results.</p>
      <p>Some institutions hand out incentivised offers - known as "conditional unconditional" offers - where they tell students that their offer will be unconditional but only if they accept it as their first choice university.</p>
      <p>The universities watchdog has previously warned that applying "psychological pressure" or "creating an impression of urgency" in decision making could be a potential breach of consumer protection law.</p>
