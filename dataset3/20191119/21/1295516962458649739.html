        <b> to Elongate," the latest episode of </b>
        <i>The Flash</i>
        <b> Season 6.</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/the-flash-tv/"><i>The Flash</i></a> just pulled a page out of <i>Captain America</i>'s book. In "License to Elongate," the latest episode, the Scarlet Speedster came face-to-face with Ultraviolet once again. However, instead of using his powers, he picked up a different tool to help: a shield.</p>
      <p>This week, Barry joined Ralph Dibny's mission to find Sue Dearbon. Ralph's search led him to an auction, where the two Team Flash members found themselves surrounded by mob bosses and other types of criminal. Barry immediately wanted to turn speedster on them, but Ralph advised him not to, explaining that there was a time and place for that -- just not here.</p>

      <p>Nevertheless, Barry suited up as the Flash. Unfortunately, the place was fitted with metahuman detectors, alerting the villains to their presence. Barry discovered that soon enough, when both he and Ralph were attacked from behind.</p>
      <p>The two metahumans found themselves tied up, where they had a heart-to-heart about Barry's disappearance. Barry admitted Ralph was right, so -- when they escaped -- he agreed to follow Ralph's lead. That meant no powers, at least for the time being.</p>

      <p>By the time Barry and Ralph got away, the villain's auction was underway. In addition to a massive weapon capable of destroying of cities, he had a number of valuables and artifacts on stage. One of those happened to be a gladiator shield, which Barry put to good use when Ultraviolet attacked.</p>
      <p>On stage in front of the villains and due to his promise to Ralph, Barry couldn't become the Flash to save himself. As such, he used what was available to him on stage. He quickly picked up the shield, round like Cap's shield, and went on the offensive with it. He even ended up throwing it once, much like the popular Avenger.</p>

      <p>Though he ultimately ditched the shield, Barry was able to overcome Ultraviolet while Ralph saved the day. Unfortunately, they didn't discover any additional information about Sue or her whereabouts, but that doesn't mean she's a lost cause. After all, <i>The Originals</i> star Natalie Dreyfuss <a href="https://www.cbr.com/the-flash-natalie-dreyfuss-sue-dearbon/">was just cast</a> to play the character, who will appear sometime later in Season 6.</p>
      <p>Airing Tuesdays at 8 p.m. on The CW, <i>The Flash</i> stars Grant Gustin, Candice Patton, Carlos Valdes, Danielle Panabaker, Tom Cavanagh, Jesse L. Martin, Danielle Nicolet and Hartley Sawyer.</p>
