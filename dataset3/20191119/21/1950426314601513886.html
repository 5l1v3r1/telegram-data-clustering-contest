        <b>Louisiana Senator John Kennedy gave a hilarious take on Jeffrey Epstein’s suspicious death while expressing doubt that the billionaire pedophile killed himself.</b>
      </p>
      <p>During a Tuesday hearing with Federal Bureau of Prisons director Kathleen Hawk Sawyer, Kennedy said the American people “deserve some answers” on Epstein’s supposed suicidal hanging from his Manhattan prison cell.</p>
      <p>“Christmas ornaments, drywall, and [Jeffrey] Epstein. Name three things that don’t hang themselves,” Kennedy said. “That’s what the American people think, and they deserve some answers.”</p>

      <p>“I know that you’re not in charge of these investigations, but you talk to the people who are. And I need you to take a very respectful message today.”</p>
      <p>“Tell the American people what happened. And don’t rush it so that they don’t do a thorough investigation,” Kennedy continued.</p>
      <p>“But you and I both know they can make this a top priority and get this done more quickly than they normally would. They need to do that. And I’d like you to deliver that message.”</p>
      <p>During the hearing, Sawyer admitted the FBI was looking into the <a href="https://www.infowars.com/fbi-now-treating-epsteins-death-as-a-criminal-matter/">involvement of a “criminal enterprise”</a> related to the circumstances of Epstein’s death.</p>
