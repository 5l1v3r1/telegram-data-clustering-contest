      <p>Be merry and bright at Stettler Town and Country Museum’s fifth annual Light Up the Night event kicking off on Friday, Dec. 6th.</p>
      <p>Light Up the Night is sure to brighten up the holiday season as hundreds of lights, as well as numerous individual displays, decorate 26 buildings for a gleaming light show on site.</p>
      <p>Karen Wahlund, Stettler Town and Country Museum manager, says local businesses and family and community service groups have set up the displays that light up about a half kilometre around the loop of the site.</p>
      <p>Visitors are able to walk the park or ride in a wagon to check out the displays.</p>
      <p>“This is a fantastic Christmas light display,” Wahlund said.</p>
      <p>“It started in 2014 and has grown every year and more and more people keep coming as the word is getting out.”</p>
      <p>This year’s event will also feature a gingerbread contest. Contestants are encouraged to drop off their gingerbread houses at the Museum before opening night on Dec. 6th, and during the night hours, visitors are able to vote on the houses. A bake sale will also kick off opening night, Wahlund mentioned.</p>
      <p>Light Up the Night runs every Friday and Saturday in December from 6-9 p.m., with the addition of the days before Christmas, Dec. 22nd, 23rd, and 24th.</p>
      <p>Light Up the Night is a fundraiser for the Stettler Town and Country Museum so donations are appreciated.</p>
      <p>For more information, contact Karen at the Museum weekdays from 10 a.m.- 3 p.m. at 403-742-4534. The Museum is located at 6502 44 Ave.</p>
