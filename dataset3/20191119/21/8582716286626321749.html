      <p><b>TOKYO — </b>Pitcher Shun Yamaguchi, who led Japan's Central League in wins, strikeouts and winning percentage this season, says he wants to move to Major League Baseball through the posting system.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old right-hander declared his intention this week. He would become the first player from Tokyo's Yomiuri Giants to pursue a career in the majors through the posting system, though outfielder Hideki Matsui left as a free agent to sign with the New York Yankees for the 2003 season.</p>
      <p>"I will work even harder as I pursue a new challenge," said Yamaguchi, who received permission from the Giants to talk to MLB teams. "I will take a shot at my dream of playing in the majors."</p>
      <p>Yamaguchi went 15-4 this season with 188 strikeouts and a .789 winning percentage, helping Yomiuri to its first CL pennant in five years.</p>
      <p>He signed with the Giants before the 2016 season after leaving the DeNA BayStars as a free agent.</p>
      <p>The posting system allows Japanese players under contract to negotiate with major league teams. If a contract is reached, their Japanese club receives a fee based on a percentage of the value of the player's contract.</p>
