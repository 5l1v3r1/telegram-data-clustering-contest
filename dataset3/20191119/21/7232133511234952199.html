      <h1>Key Indicator Signals That Bitcoin is Bottoming as Bulls Defend Key Support Level</h1>

      <p>Bitcoin (BTC) has continued slowly grinding lower as bears gain the upper hand over bulls, and sellers have now led the cryptocurrency down to a key support level that must be defended or else it will open the gates for significantly further losses in the near-term.</p>
      <p>Analysts are now noting that technical indicators may point to the possibility that Bitcoin is in the process of bottoming out, but BTC’s inability to post any strong bounce at $8,000 may point to an underlying weakness amongst the crypto’s buyers.</p>
      <h3>Bitcoin Falls to Key Support Level at $8,000</h3>
      <p>At the time of writing, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/11/analyst-claims-8700-marks-good-long-opportunity-for-bitcoin-despite-overnight-plunge/">Bitcoin</a> is trading down nearly 5% at its <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/">current price</a> of $8,160, which marks a notable drop from its daily highs of nearly $8,600 that were set yesterday morning.</p>
      <p>Today’s dip to lows of $8,000 marks an extension of the sell-off that first occurred when BTC fell below $9,000, which had previously proven to be a strong support level for the cryptocurrency.</p>
      <p>BTC did post a slight bounce at $8,000 today, signaling that this is a near-term support level that could bolster the cryptocurrency’s near-term price action.</p>
      <p>One interesting factor that may play into Bitcoin’s near-term price action is the fact that leveraged funding is currently positive, meaning that there is a premium cost to enter long positions, which makes short positions a better value proposition at the moment.</p>
      <p>Big Chonis, a popular cryptocurrency analyst on Twitter, discussed this in a recent tweet, explaining that it is currently a better value to countertrade using short positions until the ongoing downtrend begins shifting.</p>
      <blockquote>“$BTC – ever since the late October pump, Leveraged funding has been positive meaning there has been a premium cost to enter LONG positions even while #bitcoin continues to retrace, until this goes negative it’s still a better value to countertrade short, until proven otherwise.</blockquote>

      <h3>Technical Indicator Signals BTC May Be Bottoming</h3>
      <p>Despite Bitcoin’s bearish price action over the past few weeks, one <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/10/26/bitcoin-retraces-from-daily-highs-but-holds-above-key-support-level/">technical indicator</a> may be pointing to the possibility that it is currently forming a long-term bottom.</p>
      <p>The Cryptomist, a popular cryptocurrency analyst on Twitter, spoke about this in a recent tweet, saying:</p>
      <blockquote>“$BTC: Don’t think it will be long until bulls in the short term take the wheel as RSI on various time frames look bottomed! I do think this will be short term, before further descend towards a final touch of wedge support.”</blockquote>

      <p>Bitcoin’s response to its <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/04/bitcoin-may-soon-make-a-big-movement-that-favors-bulls/">support</a> within the $8,000 region will likely provide deep insight into the current market structure, as a break below this level would point to underlying bearishness that could mean significantly further losses are imminent.</p>
