      <p>Christie’s largest collection of <a href="https://wwd.com/tag/supreme/">Supreme</a> products is going up for auction this month.</p>

      <p>The Christie’s online auction, which will take place from Nov. 26 to Dec. 10, comes on the heels of <a href="https://wwd.com/business-news/legal/supremes-camo-prints-rip-off-hunting-gear-co-s-design-suit-claims-1203371263/">a recent lawsuit filed against the streetwear brand</a> by Montana-based ASAT Outdoors LLC earlier this month, which claims that Supreme’s camouflage print violates copyright infringement because it bears similarity to a design the brand created in 1985.</p>
      <p>Supreme has not yet commented on the lawsuit, however the brand recently celebrated the opening of <a href="https://wwd.com/business-news/retail/supreme-san-francisco-store-1203354855/">its San Francisco store</a> last month and released its <a href="https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/supreme-rimowa-suitcase-collaboration-1203367514/">suitcase collaboration with Rimowa</a> earlier this month.</p>
      <p>The Supreme sale is being auctioned alongside a collection of rare Hermès and <a href="https://wwd.com/tag/chanel/">Chanel</a> handbags, including the Hermès Himalaya Niloticus Crocodile Birkin for $40,000 to $60,000 and a <a href="https://wwd.com/fashion-news/fashion-scoops/private-chanel-collection-to-be-auctioned-online-by-sothebys-1203372726/">Chanel</a> spring 2004 Leather Record Clutch for $3,000 to $4,000. The live exhibition of the sale will take place from Dec. 6 to Dec. 10 in New York.</p>
