      <p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/angela-simmons/">Angela Simmons</a> generated heat among her millions of Instagram followers after sharing two posts within minutes of one another on Tuesday afternoon. The <i>Growing Up Hip Hop</i> star showcased a new, gorgeous ensemble and she looked ravishing from every angle she shared.</p>
      <p>The two posts that Angela shared on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5D2ifPn4QD/">Instagram</a> each contained two snapshots and the four photos were all slightly varied looks of the same outfit. The 32-year-old bombshell noted that she was wearing pieces from the Fashion Nova brand and she knocked it out of the park.</p>
      <p>It seems that Angela was wearing the Fashion Nova “Mountain Dreams” pant set in their taupe color. The 2-piece set consisted of a cropped top with a mock turtleneck and long sleeves as well as form-fitting knit pants with a high waistband and skinny leg structure.</p>
      <p>Simmons added a long, open fur coat from Daniel’s Leather &amp; Fur over the knit sweater ensemble. Angela wore silver hoop earrings and a bulky silver ring on one finger and chose a bright-red tote bag and black high-heel boots to complete the look.</p>
      <p>The outfit gave Angela’s fans a peek of her midriff and an opportunity to appreciate all of her curves. The various poses showed the <i>Growing Up Hip Hop</i> star standing outdoors with a green garden behind her and she looked focused and serious as she flaunted her figure.</p>

      <p>“Love this look babe,” noted one female follower.</p>

      <p>In the caption for her first Tuesday afternoon post, Angela noted that she is too busy dealing with her own stuff to worry about anybody else’s. She added that while she is looking forward to what is ahead, she is also enjoying what she has going on now.</p>
      <p>It looks like this caption resonated with many of her fans, and this isn’t the first time she has shared sentiments like this in recent days. In another social media post that Angela posted on Monday, she noted that <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5749659/angela-simmons-focused/">she was focused</a> and looked equally fierce in an all-black ensemble.</p>

The <i>Growing Up Hip Hop</i> star looks gorgeous in these new snaps and her fans love her confidence.</p>
