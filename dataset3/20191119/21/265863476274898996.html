      <p>It’s been almost four years since the songstress’ beloved husband Rene Angelil passed away. Is she ready to find love again or not?</p>
      <p>While on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, Celine Dion got candid about losing her life partner and revealed whether or not she thinks she’ll ever get married again.</p>
      <p>In fact, is there someone really special in her life already?</p>
      <p>Here is what the talented celebrity said about her dating life in the aftermath of the painful loss of her husband!</p>
      <p>It all started with a caller on the show asking about Celine’s plans for the future.</p>
      <p>She confirmed that while she doesn’t have a boyfriend at this time, she is not shutting down the possibility of finding love once more.</p>
      <p>‘It doesn’t mean that I will not find someone in my life. If I do, that would be great. If I don’t, that would be great because I’m still in love. I’ve been living all my life with Rene, he’s still within me. I see him through the eyes of my children every day. I’m so passionate about life and I’m so lucky to have my three beautiful sons. But I keep everything open, if it happens. I’m not looking for that.’</p>
      <p>She added that ‘I think it’s something that happens and it comes and you feel it. Right now, if I had someone in my life, I would tell you, because I’ve been an open book all my life.’</p>
      <p>As you may know, Celine and Rene were actually involved professionally long before it became romantic!</p>
      <p>In fact, when they started working together she was no older than 12 while he was already 38!</p>
      <p>Eventually, they started dating when she was 20 and on her 25th birthday, he asked her to marry him.</p>
      <p>They were married for two decades before Rene passed away in 2016 of throat cancer.</p>
