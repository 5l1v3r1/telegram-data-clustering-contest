      <p>Reportedly, a day before the nominations were to be released, fans quickly noticed the change in Grammys artist page. To be precise, fans noticed how <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Ariana-Grande">Ariana Grande</a>'s artist page had 6 nominations but now, the page says nominations: 11.</p>
      <p>Until November 19, 2019, Ariana had only six nominations and now fans are guessing that she has received 5 more nominations in the 2020 Grammys.</p>
      <p>Reportedly, various artist's pages have been changed and they are reflecting new numbers of nomination. Soon, the Recording Academy restored the changes which reflected new numbers.</p>
