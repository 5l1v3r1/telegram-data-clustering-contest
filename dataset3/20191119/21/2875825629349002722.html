      <h2>WALES 2-0 HUNGARY: Juventus midfielder Ramsey came up trumps after Ryan Giggs decided to select the ex-Arsenal star in the starting lineup despite recent injury troubles</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T21:49:37+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 21:49</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/ryan-giggs">Ryan Giggs</a> masterminded a famous Wales win last night as his side continued their dramatic upturn in form.</p>
      <p>Wales had only twice previously reached the finals of a major competition - the 1958 World Cup and Euro 2016.</p>
      <p>But they secured a memorable hat-trick infront of their own fans at an ecstatic <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/cardiff-city-fc">Cardiff</a> City Stadium.</p>
      <p>Perhaps now sceptical Wales fans will warm to boss Giggs after a lukewarm reception to his reign until now.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> legend wasn't everyone's favourite choice to replace Chris Coleman in January 2018 due to his record of rarely playing in friendlies.</p>
      <p>It saw the knives sharpened for Giggs when successive summer losses left Wales languishing off the pace in Group E.</p>

      <p>Yet Giggs, 45, wasn't too proud to change his philosophy of passing out from the back in favour of a more direct approach to 6ft 5in targetman Kieffer Moore, who only made his competitive debut last month.</p>
      <p>Wales' change in style continued to pay off in their sixth game without defeat since losing to Hungary in June.</p>
      <p>Giggs got his tactics right again as the recalled Aaron Ramsey ghosted in to head Wales into a 15th minute lead from skipper Gareth Bale's cross.</p>
      <p>Moore then caused further problems as he found Ramsey to fire in his 16th international goal after the break to move up to joint seventh in Wales' all-time goal-scoring charts.</p>

      <p>Giggs admitted he faced tough decisions after Wales impressively swotted aside Azerbaijan 2-0 in Baku on Saturday.</p>
      <p>But he showed his ruthless streak dropping Harry Wilson despite his goal and assist at the weekend to bring in Ramsey.</p>
      <p>While Joe Allen returned from suspension to take the place of Ethan Ampadu in midfield.</p>
      <p>Hungary were without their key centre-back Willi Orban due to injury and had other suspensions.</p>
      <p>It handed the initiative to Wales who started well as the visitors struggled to retain possession.</p>
      <p>Wales had their first shot on target in the 12th minute when Bale cut in from the left on to Ramsey's pass before curling a shot straight at Peter Gulacsi. The hosts then took the lead in the 15th minute to take control of the match.</p>
      <p>Connor Roberts released Bale down the right and his inswinging left-foot cross was headed in by Ramsey from five yards out. Hungary complained Roberts committed a foul in the build up but the goal stood.</p>

      <p>Wales had another great chance on the break in the 29th minute when Ramsey released Bale down the right again but Moore this time headed the cross just wide.</p>
      <p>The only scare for the hosts was when they had keeper Wayne Hennessey to thank for preserving their advantage in the 34th minute with a fantastic double save.</p>
      <p>First Hennessey made a brilliant left-handed reaction save to his left to deny Dominik Szoboszlai's shot before getting down low to his right to foil Roland Sallai's follow-up.</p>
      <p>Wales are 24th in the FIFA men's world rankings, 26 places higher than Hungary in 50th.</p>

      <p>The gulf in class was underlined after the break when Ramsey made it 2-0 with a clinical right-foot finish.</p>
      <p>Ben Davies curled in a free-kick from the left which Moore steered back across goal and Ramsey buried.</p>
      <p>Ramsey was only denied a hat-trick by the outstretched leg of keeper Peter Gulacsi late on.</p>
      <p>Wales were unfortunate not to add to their advantage as dangermen like Daniel James threatened.</p>
      <p>When Wales qualified previously Bale scored seven and assisted two of their 11 goals.</p>
      <p>Yet this time they have more attacking threats and are less reliant on the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> star as they highlighted replacing him with the talented Wilson off the bench in the closing stages.</p>
