      <h1>Political engagement should resume in J-K soon: Madhav</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T21:37:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 21:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/pti" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>Highlighting that over 100 days have passed since the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, senior BJP leader Ram Madhav on Tuesday said he is in favour of the resumption of political engagement in the Union Territory "sooner than later".</p>
      <p>Saying that "the sky is the limit" when it comes to demands from various quarters on the issue of Jammu &amp; Kashmir, he emphasised that the demands should be within the ambit of the Constitution.</p>
      <p>"I am personally in favour of, at least now that almost 100 days have passed since the decision was taken, some kind of political engagement to start in the Valley," he said at an event here.</p>
      <p>"I am talking about it (beginning political engagement in the Valley) in my party also. Hopefully, we will be able to do something about it," said Madhav, the BJP's National General Secretary, adding that normal political activities have been going on in Jammu.</p>
      <p>To a question about what prevents the government from releasing political leaders in Kashmir from preventive custody, he said whether the government states its position or not, "there is no doubt" that the day these leaders are out they will certainly lead protests.</p>
      <p>"We will also have to ensure that those protests need to be democratic and peaceful. That is expected. Nobody says there should not be any protest. It is a democracy, protests will be there," he said.</p>
