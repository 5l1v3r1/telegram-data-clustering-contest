      <p>Bono, The Edge and the other members of U2 happened to run into some Australian firefighters at the Melbourne airport, and sent a big shoutout to them and the others who are risking their lives battling the wildfires that have devastated the country in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>“An honour to run into a couple of @cfavic heroes at Melbourne airport today…” the members of the band wrote in a tweet issued on Tuesday, accompanying a photo of the Irish rockers posing in front of a plane surrounded by dozens of firefighters.</p>

      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.u2.com/tour">band’s tour schedule</a>, they were on their way to Adelaide for a Tuesday-night performance, the latest stop on their worldwide Joshua Tree tour, with Noel Gallagher and the High Flying Birds serving as support act.</p>
      <p>“It’s only taken me 30 years to learn how to sing these songs. And it’s great to be able to say that I’ve finally caught up with the band,” said Bono of the band’s new tour, in which they perform their 1conic 1987 album <i>The Joshua Tree</i> in its entirety.</p>

      <p>“Our audience has given <i>The Joshua Tree</i> a whole new life on this tour,” he added. “Doing these shows has been very special for us, a lot of emotion… From the despair of how relevant some of the dark songs still are, to the joy, pure fun of the staging… it’s quite a ride. And now we get to do it all over again. Auckland, Brisbane, Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth, Sydney, Tokyo, Singapore, Seoul, Mumbai… We’re coming for you.”</p>
