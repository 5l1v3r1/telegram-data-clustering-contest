      <p>The Stocking Stuffers for Seniors campaign has returned to help curb the growing epidemic of loneliness, among seniors in Canada.</p>
      <p>It is estimated that 1.4 million seniors living in Canada admit to feeling lonely and isolated which is why London Drugs has partnered with more than 90 senior care organizations, to bring joy to elderly Canadians this holiday season.</p>
      <p>Studies show that seniors who struggle with loneliness have a 59 per cent higher risk of health decline, with a 45 per cent higher risk of death.</p>
      <p>Other studies have suggested that loneliness can even be as dangerous as being an alcoholic or smoking 15 cigarettes per day.</p>
      <p>The Stocking Stuffers for Seniors is a donation drive that aims to collect gifts that are then delivered to 17,000 seniors in Western Canada, ahead of Christmas.</p>
      <p>“Just the act of receiving a gift helps to significantly improve the spirits of a senior and can have lasting mental and physical health benefits,” said Jimmy Morrison, community relations supervisor, Operation Friendship Seniors Society. </p>
      <p>“Many seniors without family spend the season alone, and it can be an especially difficult time for them. The simple gesture of giving a gift shows our seniors that people care about them at a time of year when they tend to feel the most isolated and alone.”</p>
      <p>The campaign originated in the Okanagan but has since expanded to Edmonton in an effort to support 40 low-income seniors with gifts as simple as food, hygiene products and warmth items.</p>
      <p>All 82 London Drug locations in 35 cities within Western Canada participate in the donation drive and since the beginning, approximately 24,000 gifts have been given to seniors.</p>
      <p>“The rapid growth of the Stocking Stuffers for Seniors program is a true testament to the care Canadians have for our aging population,” said Perry Lubberding, London Drugs store manager. </p>
      <p>“There are many great causes to support during the holiday season, and we are very proud that we have created a program that has resonated with so many people and has become part of their annual family holiday traditions.”</p>
      <p>The campaign also provides a chance for younger generations to connect with elderly individuals.</p>
      <p>“Over the last few years, we have seen hundreds of families participate in the program, and many parents tell us that it’s a great way for their children to learn the importance of giving to and supporting a generation of people who have given so much to our society. We hope that by connecting the younger generation with the older generation through a program like this, in future years the number of isolated and lonely seniors will be significantly reduced.”</p>
      <p>Those interested in participating in the campaign can visit any London Drugs between Nov. 18 and Dec. 16. to take a wish list tag from the tree.</p>
      <p>After receiving the tag, fulfill the items listed and return to the London Drugs location, where the gifts will then be delivered before Christmas.</p>
