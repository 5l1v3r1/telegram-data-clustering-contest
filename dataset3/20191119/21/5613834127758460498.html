      <p>Back in 1961, writer <b>Michael Moorcock</b> introduced Elric of Melniboné in the novella <i>The Dreaming City</i>, and he would go on to become the main protagonist in the multi-story epic collectively known as <b><i>The Elric Saga</i></b>. <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/the-elric-saga-tv-series-package-michael-moorcock-glen-mazzara-vaun-wilmott-1202788573/">Reported by Deadline today</a>, the fantasy-horror series has been acquired by New Republic Pictures’ Brian Oliver and producer Bradley J. Fischer.</p>
      <p>The plan? To first turn the saga into a television series, with <b>Glen Mazzara </b>(“The Walking Dead”) and <b>Vaun Wilmott </b>(“Star Trek: Discovery”) on board to adapt the novels.</p>
      <p>Deadline describes, “The novels are sensual and atmospheric sword-and-sorcery tales that center on the title character, a brooding albino warrior who presides over an unruly, decadent island nation. The novels follow Elric on a series of adventures, in which he is betrayed by his cousin, sent into exile and attempts to come to terms with his own humanity.”</p>
      <p>Oliver and Fischer are now tasked with shopping the small screen project around.</p>
