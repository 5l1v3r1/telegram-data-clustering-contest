        <b>Premier League giants Tottenham have fired their manager Mauricio Pochettino after poor run of form this season with Spurs sitting 14th place on the League standings.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Tottenham have won three out of their last twelve games, and they have also failed to get a win in their last five matches in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Pochettino's sacking at Tottenham brings to an end his five-and-a-half-years stay with Spurs where he has failed to win the League title or the Champions League.</p>
      <p>The 47-year-old Argentine was not the only one who was shown the exit doors by Spurs chiefs as his coaching staff Jesus Perez, Miguel D’Agostino and Antoni Jimenez were also axed.</p>
