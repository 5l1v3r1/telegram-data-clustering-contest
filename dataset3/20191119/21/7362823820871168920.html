      <p>Police found 74 dead cats and rescued 150 live cats and other animals from their home in Middle River – about 10 miles northeast of Baltimore.</p>
      <p>Police spokeswoman Officer Jennifer Peach said officials recovered 76 live cats and 15 dead cats from a shed in an Oct. 9 search. More animals were recovered on Oct. 17 after police obtained a second search warrant.</p>
      <p>Some rescued cats have died since they were removed, but Peach was not sure how many.</p>
      <p>Cox and Arrington were freed from custody after each posting $50,000 bail.</p>

      <p>“We might be in a situation again where we have to go in there again and rescue more animals if they are allowed to go back to them,” Vinson said.</p>
      <p>It was unclear whether Cox and Arrington had attorneys who could speak on their behalf.</p>
