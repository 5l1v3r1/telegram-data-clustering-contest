      <p>Representatives of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jose-mourinho/">Jose Mourinho</a> are working on a deal for him to replace <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/mauricio-pochettino/">Mauricio Pochettino</a> at <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a>.</p>
      <p>The Argentine was sacked on Tuesday, ending his five-and-a-half years at the club. Daniel Levy, Spurs’ chairman, said the decision was based on the ‘extremely disappointing’ results this season.</p>
      <p>Mourinho has been out of work since he was sacked by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a> last December but he’s keen on staying in England and has attended at least one of Spurs’ home matches this term.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese coach has made no secret of his desire to return to management and the Independent claim his entourage are now working on a deal for him to become Spurs’ next manager.</p>

      <p>Spurs’ decision to sack Pochettino comes as a huge surprise and the Argentine is due around £12m in compensation given the length of his deal.</p>

      <p>Part of the club’s decision to act now could have been influenced by the number of experienced managers currently out of work.</p>
      <p>As well as Mourinho, Massimiliano Allegri is also available and the Italian has been learning English in preparation to taking charge of a Premier League club.</p>
      <p>But it appears that Mourinho is the favourite and the Portuguese is said to be keen on taking charge in north London.</p>
      <p>Daniel Levy, Spurs’ chairman, said the decision was difficult to make but had to be made in light of recent results.</p>
      <p>‘We were extremely reluctant to make this change and it is not a decision the board have taken lightly, nor in haste,’ said Levy.</p>
      <p>‘Regrettably domestic results at the end of last season and the beginning of this season have been extremely disappointing.</p>
      <p>‘It falls on the board to make the difficult decisions – this one made more so given the many memorable moments we have had with Mauricio and his coaching staff – but we do so in the club’s best interests’.</p>
