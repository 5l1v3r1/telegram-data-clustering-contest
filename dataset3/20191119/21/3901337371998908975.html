      <p>Spurs suffered some embarrassing defeats before the international breaking, which included a 7-2 loss at the hands Bayern Munich while they were also elminated from the Carabao Cup fourth tier side Colchester FC.</p>
      <p>"We were extremely reluctant to make this change," Spurs chairman Daniel Levy told the club's official website,</p>
      <p>"It is not a decision the board has taken lightly, nor in haste. Regrettably domestic results at the end of last season and beginning of this season have been extremely disappointing."</p>
