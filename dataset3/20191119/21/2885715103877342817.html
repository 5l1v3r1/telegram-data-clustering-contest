      <h2>India’s chances of qualifying for Qatar 2022 look bleaker after 1-0 loss to Oman</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T21:37:54+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 21:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/express-news-service/" target="_blank">Express News Service</a></address>
      <p>For the record, India’s road to Qatar 2022 ended in a rather indifferent manner in Oman. For all practical purposes at least. Yet to win a game in the qualifying campaign and having scored just three goals in five games, India are fourth in a five-team group.</p>
      <p>While the top spot, which ensures automatic qualification to the next round, is out of the question, India still are in with a mathematical chance to finish second. For that, however, they will have to win their three remaining matches by handsome margins to erase Oman’s 9-point advantage and massive goal difference. And going by their current form, neither seems likely.</p>
      <p>A sympathetic summation of India’s 1-0 defeat to Oman in Muscat on Tuesday night would be that they were at the receiving end of a poor refereeing call, which led to the solitary goal (scored by Mohsin Al Ghassani in 33rd minute). The chance of a comeback was made tougher after three key players got injured — two in the first half itself — that forced substitutions, throwing coach Igor Stimac’s plans out off track. These points, however, will only momentarily numb the pain for India.</p>
      <p>The fact is that India never posed any threat to Oman. They did not have a single shot on target in the regulation time as well as during the six added minutes. There was no urgency in their largely indifferent play and, at least in the early parts of the match, India’s defenders created more goal-scoring chances for Oman than the Omani players did for themselves.</p>
      <p>From that perspective, India were lucky to escape with a 1-0 loss.</p>
      <p>Oman, who had defeated India 2-1 in the campaign-opener in September, were always going to be out of reach for India, especially since they have looked woefully out of form in the last two games. Injuries to players like Sandesh Jhingan and Rowlin Borges only added to Stimac’s headache, forcing him to once again tinker with his starting 11.</p>
      <p>The Croat made three changes to his side that drew Afghanistan 1-1 in Dushanbe last week – strikers Manvir Singh and Farukh Choudhary, and defender Nishu Kumar coming in for Pritam Kotal, Mandar Rao Desai and Sahal Abdul Samad. Playmaker Anirudh Thapa continued to warm the bench, with Stimac opting for a physically-stronger Pronay Halder for the second consecutive match.</p>
      <p>It was an attacking line-up; ambitious ploy one would think given the gulf between the two teams. They paid for it almost immediately – in the continuance of the first leg between the two teams, Oman’s pacey winger Rabia al Mandhar sprinted past right-back Rahul Bheke, who tripped him inside the box. The consequent penalty, in the seventh minute, was shot over the bar by Mohsin Al Ghassani.</p>
      <p>Oman continued to operate at a high tempo after the missed penalty, and Ghassani made amends soon after the half-hour mark after he got on the end of a beautiful defence-splitting through pass by Mohsin Johar Al Khaldi and beat goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu with a first-time effort. Replays, however, showed Ghassani to be marginally offside when the pass was played.</p>
      <p>India’s troubles were compounded almost immediately as Stimac had to make a forced substitution after centre-back Adil Khan picked up an injury. Minutes later, midfielder Halder, too, had to be brought off after he injured his shoulder.</p>
      <p>Stimac, who has made a habit of making game-saving substitutions late in the second half, now had to make two inside the first 45 minutes. He brought on centre-back Anas Edathodika, who joined the team only on Monday following a family emergency, and Vinit Rai as replacements.</p>
      <p>India played better in the second half with a lot of ball possession and attacks at the opposition citadel but a clear chance eluded them. Oman nearly doubled their lead in the 64th minute but Sandhu dived full length to his left to block an Al Khaldi free-kick. Another Omani header from close range flew over the crossbar.</p>
      <p>Under Stimac, India have made it a habit to allow an early goal before making a late comeback. That, however, was not possible on Tuesday as Oman’s midfield and defence did not allow the visitors any space in their half. An injury to Bheke, who was substituted by Sarthak Golui, took away whatever little chance India had to make a comeback.</p>
      <p>India will now have to win at least two of the three matches to finish third in the group behind Qatar and Oman. From the beginning, India’s target from this joint qualifying campaign was to make the cut for the 2023 Asian Cup. Teams finishing third are guaranteed a spot in the next round of qualifiers for the continental championships.<br/>India’s three remaining matches will be played next year – Qatar at home on March 26, Bangladesh away on June 4 followed by Afghanistan at home on June 9. A third-place finish looked a safe bet for India at the start of the campaign. The recent results, and a host of injuries, have put that in question now.</p>
