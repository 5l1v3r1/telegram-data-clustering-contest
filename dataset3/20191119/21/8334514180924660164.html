      <p>LONDON (Reuters) - A snap poll released immediately after a pre-election debate between Prime Minister Boris Johnson and opposition Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn showed a “dead heat”, YouGov said on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>A total of 51% of respondents said Johnson performed best overall whilst 49% said Corbyn was stronger, according to figures which excluded those who said they did not know.</p>
      <p>“On balance this is probably better for the Labour leader, why? Because a dead heat when you are significantly behind in the polls is probably better news for you that the person who is leading,” said YouGov’s Political Research Manager Chris Curtis.</p>
      <p>“It doesn’t seem from these initial numbers to be a game changing moment.”</p>
