      <p>Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman snapped back at ranking GOP House Intelligence Committee member Rep. Devin Nunes <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/19/adam-schiff-blocks-republicans-attempts-to-question-impeachment-witnesses/">during Tuesday’s impeachment hearings</a> for referring to him as “Mr. Vindman” rather than by his military rank.</p>
      <p>“Mr. Vindman, you testified in your deposition that you did not know the whistleblower,” Nunes (R-Calif.) said.</p>
      <p>To which Vindman, a decorated Army officer and National Security Council official, responded: “Ranking member, it’s Lieutenant Colonel Vindman, please.”</p>
      <p>Nunes briefly paused before correcting Vindman’s title and repeating the question.</p>
      <p>“I do not know who the whistleblower is that is correct,” Vindman, 44, then answered, before saying he’d been advised by his attorney not to discuss specific members of the intelligence community.</p>
      <p>The exchange quickly went viral. One user <a href="https://twitter.com/Cashidah/status/1196816710675902464">noted</a>: “Vindman is not here for Nunes s–t this morning.”</p>
      <p>Others, meanwhile, including <a href="https://nypost.com/2015/02/03/disgraced-ex-commish-bernie-kerik-cant-get-a-full-time-job/">disgraced ex-NYPD top cop Bernie Kerik</a>, blasted Vindman as haughty.</p>
      <p>“Every enlisted service member in the United States military just looked at this guy and said, what a d–k! That arrogance is why he believed he could dictate foreign policy over President @realDonaldTrump,” <a href="https://twitter.com/BernardKerik/status/1196854126732283906">Kerik tweeted</a>.</p>
