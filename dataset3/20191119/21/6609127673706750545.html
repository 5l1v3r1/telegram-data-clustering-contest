        <b>THEY’VE won three in a row when it counts for nothing.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Now Steve Clarke’s Scotland need to prove they can produce when it means absolutely everything.</p>

      <p>San Marino at home, Cyprus away. Last night Kazakhstan became the latest team to trudge off in defeat in front of the Tartan Army.</p>
      <p>But can this group of battle-scarred players deliver a couple of victories when there’s more than pride at stake?</p>
      <p>In four months’ time we’ll find out.</p>
      <p>But maybe, just maybe this team is timing its run to perfection and is heading to the Euros after all via the March play-off route.</p>

      <p>John McGinn certainly couldn’t be doing any better in a dark blue jersey as he scored twice again last night to take his tally to seven goals in his last six Scotland games.</p>
      <p>Steven Naismith also hit this net here in this comeback victory after Kazakhstan stormed into a first-half lead.</p>
      <p>It was always going to be hard to judge these players in such a meaningless fixture like this.</p>
      <p>They all say pulling on the dark blue jersey is the same honour and privilege regardless of the circumstances. An international cap is an international cap no matter the opposition or occasion, and all that.</p>

      <p>But the atmosphere inside Hampden told a different story.</p>
      <p>This was never going to be a game where the loyal Scotland supporters would see their heroes at their very best.</p>
      <p>All anyone could hope for was that there would be signs of progress ahead of the big important play-off in around four months’ time. That they wouldn’t see them at their worst.</p>
      <p>And by the end of the 90 minutes there was enough to feel encouraged by - certainly when it comes to the players Clarke has from middle to front.</p>
      <p>McGinn’s passionate performance was again everything the supporters want to see with James Forrest and Ryan Christie impressive again. Ryan Jack and Callum McGregor are beginning to look like a really solid partnership in the heart of midfield.</p>

      <p>Clarke went with the same line-up that started against Cyprus in Nicosia at the weekend which was possibly the first surprise.</p>
      <p>Could he have freshened things up?</p>
      <p>Should he have brought in the likes of John Fleck, Stuart Armstrong or Graeme Shinnie to start this one?</p>
      <p>Possibly. But the Scotland boss clearly wanted continuity in selection as he picked, arguably, his strongest team from the players available.</p>
      <p>There’s no doubt Kazakhstan looked far more energetic in the first-half.</p>
      <p>That said McGinn had two half-chances in the first 20 minutes which he should have maybe done better with.</p>
      <p>The Aston Villa star’s first opportunity almost came too early in the game as he couldn’t quite asort his feet out to get on the end of a good cross from left-back Greg Taylor.</p>
      <p>The second chance saw McGinn pull a shot just wide of target from inside the penalty box.</p>

      <p>That was as encouraging as it got in a first-half which was seriously lacking in genuine quality from a Scotland point of view.</p>
      <p>And the goal Clarke’s side conceded after 34 minutes only underlined the fragility of this defence of his.</p>
      <p>Big Scott McKenna looked short of sharpness in Cyprus on Saturday afternoon and here he was again being made to look foolish as he backed off Zainutdinov as he ran towards him.</p>
      <p>The Aberdeen centre-back didn’t have defensive partner Declan Gallagher close enough to him, either. But McKenna should have sensed the danger and charged out to make a block.</p>
      <p>As it was he did nothing and the Kazakhstan attacker was able to pick his spot. In fairness, the one he picked couldn’t have been much better with keeper David Marshall left rooted as the ball was whipped past him and into the back of the net.</p>
      <p>But it was just yet another goal conceded which had the fans gasping in frustration and exasperation. Clarke has bemoaned the fact his team struggle to keep clean sheets and here was another one gone.</p>

      <p>It could have been worse before half-time - Forrest could have sustained a serious injury after Aibol Abiken brought him down by raking his studs along his Achilles.</p>
      <p>Celtic and Scotland physio Tim Williamson was first on the scene and you couldn’t help think his club gaffer, Neil Lennon, would have been sending subliminal messages to him to get the winger off.</p>
      <p>But Forrest was able to run off the knock and play on.</p>
      <p>Scotland had to raise their game for the second half and that’s exactly what they did to level the game three minutes after the break.</p>
      <p>Naismith was brought down on the edge of the Kazak penalty box with McGinn grabbing the ball and responsibility of the set piece situation.</p>
      <p>It was too close to the goal to be curled over the wall.</p>
      <p>So McGinn got his head down and smashed it, with his blasted shot clipping off skipper Bauyrzhan Islamkhan on its way into the net.</p>
      <p>The game was there to be won again and Scotland came close to taking the lead soon after the equaliser went in.</p>
      <p>Forrest missed the target with a good chance before Naismith passed up two opportunities he could have done better with.</p>
      <p>But there was much more impetus about the team with the visitors backing off in their own half.</p>
      <p>Scotland’s second goal arrived in 64 minutes.</p>
      <p>Liam Palmer combined with Christie down the right with the defender’s cross deflecting up into the air. The Kazak keeper looked favourite to get to it but Naismith jumped highest to head home.</p>
      <p>McGinn then sealed this win with a second on the night for himself as he finished off a neat move on stoppage time.</p>
