      <p>A respected scientist has claimed that that life exists on Mars in the form of bizarre insect-like organisms resembling bees.</p>
      <p>Professor Emeritus William Romoser, an entomologist from Ohio University, said images captured by Nasa’s Mars rovers clearly show ‘fossilised and living creatures’ on the Red Planet’s surface.</p>
      <p>‘There has been and still is life on Mars,’ Romoser said.</p>
      <p>‘There is apparent diversity among the Martian insect-like fauna which display many features similar to Terran insects that are interpreted as advanced groups – for example, the presence of wings, wing flexion, agile gliding/flight, and variously structured leg elements.’</p>
      <p>He said the rovers have snapped pictures which ‘clearly depict the insect- and reptile-like forms’.</p>
      <p>The scientist even suggested one image shows a living insect ‘in a steep dive before pulling up just before hitting the ground’.</p>

      <p>‘Once a clear image of a given form was identified and described, it was useful in facilitating recognition of other less clear, but none-the-less valid, images of the same basic form,’ Romoser said.</p>

      <p>‘An exoskeleton and jointed appendages are sufficient to establish identification as an arthropod. Three body regions, a single pair of antennae, and six legs are traditionally sufficient to establish identification as “insect” on Earth.</p>
      <p>‘These characteristics should likewise be valid to identify an organism on Mars as insect-like. On these bases, arthropodan, insect-like forms can be seen in the Mars rover photos.’</p>
      <p>Romoser said the Martian ‘creatures’ loosely resemble bumblebees or carpenter bees on Earth.</p>
      <p>He suggested the ‘bees’ appearing to shelter or nest in caves and claimed other images show a fossilized creature that resembles a snake.</p>

      <p>Romoser was an entomology professor at Ohio University for 45 years and co-founded its Tropical Disease Institute. He also spent nearly 20 years as a visiting vector-borne disease researcher at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases. Between 1973 and 1998, Romoser authored and co-authored four editions of the widely-used textbook called ‘The Science of Entomology’.</p>
      <p>Romoser noted that ‘interpretations of insect- and reptile-like creatures he described may change in the future as knowledge of life on Mars evolves, but that the sheer volume of evidence is compelling’.</p>
      <p>‘The presence of higher metazoan organisms on Mars implies the presence of nutrient/energy sources and processes, food chains and webs, and water as elements functioning in a viable, if extreme, ecological setting sufficient to sustain life,’ he said.</p>

      <p>‘I have observed instances suggestive of standing water or small water courses with evident meander and with the expected blurring of small submerged rocks, larger emergent rocks at the atmosphere/water interface, a moist bank area, and a drier area beyond the moist area. Water on Mars has been reported a number of times, including surface water detected by instrumentation on Viking, Pathfinder, Phoenix, and Curiosity.</p>
      <p>‘The evidence of life on Mars presented here provides a strong basis for many additional important biological as well as social and political questions,” he added. It also represents a solid justification for further study.’</p>
