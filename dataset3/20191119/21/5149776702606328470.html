      <h2>The England all-rounder is one of the star picks in The Hundred as she moves to Trent Bridge alongside fiancee Katherine Brunt</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T21:27:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 21:27</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Davies</a></address>
      <p>When Natalie Sciver was growing up she had a poster of David Beckham on her wall, no doubt like thousands of other children of the late 90s.</p>
      <p>In Sciver's case he was her sporting hero thanks to his exploits for Manchester United, Real Madrid and England.</p>
      <p>These days, Sciver hopes to be someone else's David Beckham, including next summer when she plays for <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/cricket">Trent Rockets</a> women's team in The Hundred.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old England all-rounder and World Cup winner is perhaps at her sporting peak and women's cricket - and sport in general - is flourishing, affording more scope for female athletes to be role models than ever before.</p>
      <p>For the next generation of women cricketers, the picture will only get better, but she is happy with her lot now as she aims to inspire.</p>
      <p>"I was so lucky with how I started. I finished university and pretty much got handed a contract," she said.</p>
      <p>"I've never had to worry about the real world in my life, which is amazing. To see women's sport growing and where it can go is really exciting.</p>
      <p>"It's really important to have those role models for young girls.</p>
      <p>"The England team has really connected to that, to make sure we're accessible to young girls and boys for that matter.</p>
      <p>"They love women's cricket. If we can make that connection in the crowd and after the game it's really important to us.</p>
      <p>"When I was younger I looked up to David Beckham. Wrong sport I know, but having that male role model was really important to me.</p>

      <p>"Hopefully I can be someone's David Beckham in years to come."</p>
      <p>No matter how inspirational Beckham and Sciver are there will always be a huge difference in their bank balances.</p>
      <p>No matter how much women's sport has grown there is still a huge difference in salaries between her male counterparts.</p>
      <p>In the men's tournament next summer salaries range from £30,000 to £125,000. For the women it is £3,600 to £15,000.</p>
      <p>Sciver admits she would like to see the gap reduced and believes that will happen in time.</p>
      <p>"It's a difficult subject really. In terms of international cricket, England have come such a long way already," she said.</p>
      <p>"From where we started to where we are now, we're so much further ahead. We're only going to improve from there.</p>
      <p>"Obviously we'd love to be a bit closer in terms of pay gaps and things. Sometimes it's not realistic for those things to happen so soon.</p>
      <p>"I'm assured things like that will get smaller in time. We can always hope for more. At the moment, at 27, I'm doing pretty well not thinking about the real world."</p>
      <p>At present, Sciver is looking forward to coming to the East Midlands to play for Trent Rockets alongside England teammate Katherine Brunt, with the couple also announcing their engagement last month.</p>
      <p>Sciver is certain the tournament will be a positive step for women's cricket with the team's games to be played in Derby and Leicester, as well as at Trent Bridge.</p>

      <p>"I had a few options I could have gone for but I wanted to be part of this team and be reunited with a former coach in Salliannn Briggs," she said.</p>
      <p>"I actually live in the Midlands so this a home team for me.</p>
      <p>"The Hundred is a chance for our game to go to the next level and make sure we have a bigger pool of players ready for the international game.</p>
      <p>"From a women's side of things it's great there are eight teams, two teams more than the KSL. That's more players being exposed to different pressures and making a step up from county cricket.</p>
      <p>"I think it will still look a lot like T20. We had a couple of practice games last summer and apart from getting the hang of counting to five not six it's pretty similar!</p>
      <p>"In terms of playing, you always think you have less time than you have. It will be the same with The Hundred.</p>
      <p>"There will be a few tactical things to learn though."</p>
