      <p>A group of teenagers stormed a school bus full of young children and began battering them, police say.</p>
      <p>The gang of teens ambushed the bus as it was stopped just one mile away from Snapfinger Elementary <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/school/">School</a> in Dekalb County, Georgia on Monday.</p>
      <p>School district officials said the attack was so violent, one child needed to be taken to a hospital with undisclosed injuries.</p>
      <p>Officers responded to the scene and arrested an 18-year-old who was not a student, a high school student and two middle school students.</p>
      <p>They were all charged with assault, but their identities have not been released and police have specified no motive for the attack.</p>

      <p>Parents of children in the school district were outraged upon learning of the incident, but said they were not told about the assault until they picked their kids up from school, <a href="https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/dekalb-county/group-of-teens-storm-school-bus-attack-children-inside-officials-say/1009947141">WSB-TV 2</a> reported.</p>

      <p>Latrice Lewis said: ‘This is my kid’s second week at school. This is ridiculous. This is why I don’t have my kids on the bus, I drive them to school and I drive them back home.’</p>
      <p>Another parent, Alexis Clarke called the incident ‘outrageous,’ and said: ‘I think that’s really bad and, if they did beat up some elementary school students, they definitely deserve to go to jail.’</p>
      <p>School officials later released a statement, which read: ‘The safety and well-being of our students is out top priority.</p>
      <p>‘Two middle school students, one high school students, and an 18-year-old non-student attacked elementary students, which resulted in one elementary student being transported to Children’s Healthcare in Atlanta.’</p>
      <p>The statement continued, ‘Dekalb County School District Police responded immediately, investigated and obtained warrants for the high school students and the 18-year-old non-student. Two middle schools students were arrested and taken to Juvenile Intake.’</p>
