      <p>Jeremy Corbyn offered to give <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/boris-johnson/">Boris Johnson</a> a copy of <i>A Christmas Carol</i> so the PM could understand how ‘nasty’ Scrooge was.</p>
      <p>The jibe came after the rivals were asked what they would give each other for Christmas during the<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/johnson-corbyn-clash-general-election-debate-11184324/"> ITV general election debate.</a></p>
      <p>Boris retorted by saying he’d give Corbyn a copy of his <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/brexit/">Brexit</a> deal – or a pot of damsel jam.</p>
      <p>It came after they were forced to share an awkward handshake by presenter Julie Etchingham.</p>
      <p>The sour tone of politics dominated much of tonight’s leaders debate, with the pair both facing accusations of degrading debate and making the political climate toxic.</p>

      <p>The two leaders were challenged to step up their game on tackling abuse and poor behaviour in politics, after a tumultuous few years that has seen a rise in hate crime towards MPs, including the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox.</p>
      <p>The audience applauded after one member of the public asked the party leaders how the nation could ‘trust’ either of them.</p>
      <p>Responding, Johnson blamed the lack of trust in politicians on parliament repeatedly blocking Brexit and said the way to restore trust was to ‘get Brexit done’.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Corbyn said ‘trust has to be earned’ and that this could only be done by ‘listening to people’ – from Chief Executives to rough sleepers.</p>
      <p>The pair then obliged somewhat awkwardly to a request from Julie Etchingham to pledge to ‘raise the tone’ of politics and to shake hands on it.</p>

      <p>She said: ‘There are many people, many politicians indeed, who feel that the nastiness of political debate in this country has got out of control.</p>
      <p>‘Will you two tonight look at one another and no matter who becomes prime minister make a gesture to improve things today – make a pledge and promise?.</p>
      <p>But the rare moment of ‘unity’  left some viewers cringing.</p>
      <p>Others felt like it was insincere given the rest of the debate saw them clash over issues like Brexit and the NHS.</p>

      <p>After the debate, a snap YouGov poll out Boris Johnson mildly ahead of Jeremy Corbyn, by 51 to 49.</p>
      <p>However, many viewers were left underwhelmed by the debate.</p>
      <p>Andrew Neil said given the Tories were way ahead in the polls ahead of the deabte, it was not a ‘great result’ for Johnson, but it was not a ‘game changer either.</p>
      <p>Sky News correspondent Lewis Goodall said both leaders seemed ‘disliked in equal measure’ by the audience, which he said ‘more or less tallies with my travels on the road.’</p>
      <p>Journalist Paul Mason said the debate was ‘stiled’ and that  neither leader got into full flow. </p>
