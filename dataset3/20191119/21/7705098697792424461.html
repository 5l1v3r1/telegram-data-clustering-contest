      <p>Finn has come a long way since his introduction in the <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/star-wars-the-force-awakens"><b>The Force Awakens</b></a>. With <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker"><b>The Rise of Skywalker</b></a> coming next month, fans will see his journey reach its conclusion. While speaking with <a href="https://ew.com/movies/2019/11/19/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker/">Entertainment Weekly</a>, John Boyega reflected on Finn’s growth in the series. Boyega added that he actually had to “read the script six more times because there was so much information in there.”</p>
      <p>Boyega also noted that he appreciates the way Finn grew out of being a “comedic goofy dude.”</p>
      <p>“I definitely wanted more after <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/star-wars-the-last-jedi"><b>Episode VIII</b></a>. [<b>Rise of Skywalker</b>] makes Finn’s <b>Episode VIII</b> arc make more sense,” added Boyega. “We got to bring out a side of Finn we haven’t seen.”</p>

      <p>Boyega also praised director J.J. Abrams for encouraging improvisation on the set.</p>
      <p>“J.J. came back with a new energy and new vibe,” said Boyega. “He wanted dialogue to be messy and natural, and that got all of us really excited.”</p>
      <p><b>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</b> will hit theaters on December 20.</p>
