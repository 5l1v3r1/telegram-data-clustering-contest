      <p>Senator Dino Melaye has promised to report Governor <a href="https://www.legit.ng/tag/governor-yahaya-bello.html">Yahaya Bello</a> and other politicians in Kogi state to the International Criminal Court (ICC) over the alleged violence that occurred during the senatorial and governorship election in the state.</p>
      <p>Melaye, who is currently battling to get re-elected in the National Assembly, is trailing his opponent, Smart Adeyemi in the Kogi west senatorial district rerun poll.</p>
      <p>But the lawmaker, in a post on Twitter on Tuesday, November 19, said what occurred in Kogi state was more of a civil war than an election.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Melaye alleged that 16 people have so far been killed in the Kogi election violence. The senator, when citing an instance of irregularity in Okene local government, said the total number of votes INEC allocated to the APC exceeded the number of Voters Registration Cards (PVC) collected.</p>
      <p>"<i>What we had in Kogi is no election, what we had was a civil war that has claimed 16 lives so far. I will report Bello, Smart Adeyemi. Taofik, Speaker Kolawole, and Sunday Faleke to the international community and then proceed to Hague. This I promise,</i> "he tweeted.</p>
