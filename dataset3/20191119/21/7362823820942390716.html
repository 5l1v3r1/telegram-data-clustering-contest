      <h1>Dutch authorities find 25 migrants in refrigerated container aboard ship</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T21:26:01+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 21:26</time> by <a rel="author">Louis Casiano</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/europe">Dutch</a> authorities said Tuesday they found 25 migrants stowed away in a refrigerated container on a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/united-kingdom">United Kingdom</a>-bound ferry.</p>
      <p>The ferry -- the Britannia Seaways, which is owned by Danish operator DFDS -- left the Netherlands on Tuesday and quickly turned around to the Dutch port of Vlaardingen after the migrants made a hole in a trailer, the shipping company said in a <a href="https://www.dfds.com/en/about/media/news/britannia-crew-find-migrants-in-refrigerated-trailer">statement</a>.</p>
      <p>"Police officers entered the ship from a police boat that met them as soon as Britannia entered the port," DFDS said.</p>

      <p>The ship was on its way to Felixstowe in southern England. Two of the migrants were taken to a hospital to be treated for hypothermia. Their conditions were unknown.</p>
      <p>The others received medical treatment at the port and were taken to a police location, emergency coordination organization Rijnmond Veilig said in a <a href="https://www.rijnmondveilig.nl/incidenten/inzet-hulpdiensten-vulcaanhaven-vlaardingen/">statement</a>. It was not clear where the migrants were from or how they got aboard the ship.</p>

      <p>A police dog was used to comb the ship for other migrants but didn't find any, the group said.</p>
      <p>The discovery comes weeks after <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/british-police-formally-identify-all-39-bodies-found-inside-truck">39 Vietnamese migrants</a> were found dead in a refrigerated truck near London. Two people in Britain and eight in Vietnam have been in their deaths.</p>
