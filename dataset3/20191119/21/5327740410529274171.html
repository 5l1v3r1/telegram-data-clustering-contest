      <p>Mounties are remaining tightlipped about why they asked the public to leave the Stawamus Chief early Tuesday afternoon.</p>
      <p>In a tweet sent out around 12:20 p.m., RCMP asked the public to leave the Squamish-area mountain due to a “police incident.”</p>
      <p>“Expect a noted police presence and please do not post pictures of where members are located,” the tweet read.</p>
      <p>The threat seemed to resolve itself within the hour, according to posts just after 1 p.m. from RCMP.</p>
      <p>The risk to public safety has ended at the Stawamus Chief. There is still a heavy police presence in the area and will be for the next 30 minutes or so.”</p>
      <p>Black Press Media has reached out to Squamish RCMP for more information.</p>
