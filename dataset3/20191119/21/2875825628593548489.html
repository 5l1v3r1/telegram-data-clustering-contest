      <p>With her personal fortune tipping over the $1 billion mark, she has now almost doubled her worth by selling off a majority 51 per cent share in her company.</p>
      <p>It was announced that beauty giant Coty had snapped up their stake in Kylie Cosmetics in a deal worth around $600 million.</p>
      <p>It means Kylie could now be worth around $1.6 billion - propelling her towards the $2 billion mark.</p>
