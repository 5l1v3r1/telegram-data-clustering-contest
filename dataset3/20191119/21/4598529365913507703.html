      <p>Shortly after the public impeachment testimony of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman concluded Tuesday afternoon, Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) criticized Republican attacks against Vindman.</p>
      <p>During Vindman’s testimony Tuesday, <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/no-vindman-didnt-violate-the-chain-of-command-he-followed-wh-lawyers-orders">Republicans</a> attempted to attack him for following a White House lawyer’s instructions and going to him with concerns about President Trump’s actions regarding the Ukraine pressure campaign. Vindman also found himself defending his credibility and job performance after a <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/jordan-vindman-impeachment-hearing-testimony">tense exchange</a> with Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) during the hearing.</p>
      <p>While expressing his frustration, Manchin called Vindman a “war hero” who didn’t deserve what he views as “unacceptable” attacks by Republicans, according to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/impeachment-hearing-11-19-19/h_ae6600e8290f79125c736ed118a880d1">CNN</a>.</p>
      <p>“There’s nothing right about this. There’s nothing right. I mean, you know, it’s just dead wrong. The bottom line is people are going to have to make a decision (about impeachment),” Manchin said, according to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/impeachment-hearing-11-19-19/h_ae6600e8290f79125c736ed118a880d1">CNN</a>. “But the bottom line is for anyone to condone this and say this is normal behavior and this is how we should act as a country, superpower of the world, is wrong.”<b> </b></p>
      <p>CNN added that Manchin said that he declined to make a decision about whether he would vote to convict Trump in a Senate trial until after the House takes action.</p>
