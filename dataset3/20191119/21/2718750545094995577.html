      <h1>Who’s Buying Me Hugsy, Joey’s Nighttime Penguin Pal, From the <i>Friends</i> Auction?</h1>

      <p>Could there <i>be </i>a worst time to convince my accountant I’m not always playing fast and loose with my savings? Warner Bros. announced today that dozens of notable <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2019/09/friends-behind-the-scenes-gossip-casting.html"><i>Friends</i></a><i> </i>props and costumes will be auctioned off to celebrate <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2019/09/friends-building-little-owl-restaurant-owner.html">the show’s 25th anniversary</a>, which is set to go public <a href="https://propstore.com/FRIENDS/">here</a> on Tuesday, December 3. (It’s also going to raise money for charity. No, the charity isn’t the pockets of Warner Bros.) While the full scope of items hasn’t yet been revealed, the <a href="https://propstore.com/friends-preview-gallery/">prime lot</a> right now is undeniably the beloved Hugsy the Nighttime Penguin Pal, as well as these memorable props you’ll remember from your years of incessant rewatching: Joey and Chandler’s wooden canoe, Joey’s <i>Soap Opera Digest</i><b> </b>magazine, and Monica and Chandler’s wedding invitation set. There will also be a ton of Rachel outfits, and — this is huge — you don’t even have to cut your hair to a shaggy bob to buy them. Just pony up about $5,000, instead.</p>
