      <h2>I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here's Nadine Coyle's rivalry with ex Girls Aloud bandmate Cheryl left her questioning everything</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T21:30:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 21:30</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>There's nothing secret about the lasting animosity between former Girls Aloud stars Nadine Coyle and Cheryl Tweedy.</p>
      <p>Nadine claimed Cheryl and the rest of the group blindsided her by agreeing to split behind her back in 2013, while Cheryl alleged Nadine wanted out to go solo.</p>
      <p>At the peak of the feud, Nadine, 34, accused her bandmates of being "bitter" because she got more lines to sing while Cheryl accused her nemesis of being "full of sh**."</p>
      <p>And the rivalry reached its most sour point when the pair went head-to-head in the charts with their solo offerings during the band's 2010 hiatus - a move that caused Nadine to reevaluate everything.</p>

      <p>Indeed, having been touted as the best singer, many expected the Irish singer to be the band's breakout success.</p>
      <p>But her album Insatiable entered the UK album chart at number 47, failing to make a mark on Cheryl's Messy Little Raindrops, which shot straight to number one and went platinum.</p>
      <p>And in a desperate bid to escape fame and music, a wounded Nadine fled her home in Los Angeles to rethink her life.</p>
      <p>"I wanted a bit of independence to do things by myself for a while. No managers, no stylists, no hair and make-up," the Derry-born star previously told the Daily Mail.</p>

      <p>"I just wanted to experience some things by myself. We’d taken time off from Girls Aloud, I’d done this album and I wanted to figure out who I was."</p>
      <p>She moved to New York. And as well as leaving music behind, she also left her fiancé, American football star Jason Bell, confirming their split on <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> .</p>
      <p>“I got with Jason when I was 23 and [got] engaged, and I suddenly thought: ‘Hang on. I can’t get married, I’m only 25!’" she explained to The Sun.</p>
      <p>"I needed to take a wee bit of time out. So I moved to New York.</p>
      <p>"I tweeted that we’d split up, but it was stupid because it was just that he was really getting on my nerves.</p>

      <p>"I was just in a really bad mood and I really disliked him for a while!”</p>
      <p>The couple eventually reunited and went on to have daughter Anaiya in 2014 before separating for good this September.</p>
      <p>She also made several attempts at relaunching her solo career, releasing comeback single Go To Work in 2017.</p>
      <p>It failed to make the Official Singles Chart and she was forced to cancel a seven-date tour of the UK and Ireland in 2018.</p>

      <p>Admitting it "wasn't meant to be" she told fans she couldn't deliver the kind of show she wanted.</p>
      <p>"You deserve the best show possible and with such big venues and very little dates it was becoming impossible to achieve what we had wanted to do," she explained.</p>
      <p>"Everything is a lesson &amp; this is definitely one for me. Thank you for your continued love &amp; support!!!"</p>
