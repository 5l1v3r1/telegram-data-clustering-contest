      <h1>ESPN’s Playoff Predictor Thinks 2 SEC Teams Will Make It</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T21:31:44+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 21:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>The SEC has two teams (LSU and Georgia) in the top four of the College Football Playoff rankings, and that should hold true later tonight when the committee unveils new standings. Last week, Alabama was just outside of the top four, coming in at No. 5.</p>
      <p>It seems like every year, there is talk of the SEC getting two teams into the playoff. Two seasons ago, it actually happened, with Alabama and Georgia facing off in the national title game.</p>
      <p>This year, LSU is the favorite to make it from the conference, but Georgia and Alabama are still in the running. As of today, ESPN’s Allstate Playoff Predictor thinks the SEC will account for half of the playoff participants again.</p>
      <p>According to the predictor, the SEC has a 64 percent chance of sending multiple teams to the playoff.</p>

      <p>In order for more than one SEC team to reach the playoff, one of two scenarios has to play out.</p>
      <p>In the first one, Georgia wins out, beats LSU in the conference title game and secures a playoff berth. Because LSU would be 12-1 with their only loss coming against the Bulldogs, they would get in as well.</p>
      <p>In the second scenario, LSU wins out, finishing 13-0 and knocking Georgia out of playoff contention. However, the committee decides that an 11-1 Alabama team, even without Tua Tagovailoa, is the best choice for the final playoff spot.</p>
      <p>Which one of those situations is most likely to occur?</p>
