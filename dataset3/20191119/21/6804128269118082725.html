      <h1>Jose Mourinho to Tottenham: Portuguese 'wants job' after Pochettino and the one demand he has</h1>
      <h2>Jose Mourinho will be an interested spectator after Mauricio Pochettino was sacked by Tottenham</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T21:42:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 21:42</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Ha, Lee Wilmot, Joe Doyle</a></address>
      <p>Could Jose Mourinho be on the brink of a return to Premier League football?</p>
      <p>The former Chelsea and Manchester United manager has been linked with plenty of jobs since leaving Old Trafford in January.</p>
      <p>And there is now a vacancy in the Premier League - at Tottenham.</p>
      <p>Mauricio Pochettino was sacked by Spurs on Tuesday evening, with Mourinho immediately installed as the frontrunner to replace him.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese had previously been linked with the Emirates Stadium, with Unai Emery under pressure as Arsenal boss.</p>
      <p>So what do we know about his future?</p>
      <h3>Mourinho's one demand</h3>
      <p>In September, <a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/jose-mourinho">Mourinho</a> revealed he was ready for a return to management - but on one condition.</p>
      <p>And that's to manage a club where the aim is to win.</p>
      <p>"The only thing I know is what I don't want," Mourinho told the <a href="https://twitter.com/CoachesVoice/status/1169655933028503552">Coaches' Voice</a>. "What I don't want is crystal clear.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>"What I want - the general profile of it of course - but I cannot say clubs and country. I am quite pathological in this sense that I have to play to win.</p>
      <p>"Then if I win or don't win it's my problem, the players, the club and the structure. But I need a project where the feeling is that I play to win.</p>
      <p>"If someone gives me a wonderful, incredible, amazing 10-year contract and the objective of the team is to stay in the first part of the table, If you finish seventh or eighth or ninth is perfect that's not for me. That's my nature."</p>

      <h3>La Liga hint</h3>
      <p>Less than a week after that interview, Mourinho dropped a major hint that he was set for a return to La Liga six years after leaving Real Madrid.</p>
      <p>"The most important thing for me is that my next role is with an elite club that has an ambition which challenges and excites me," <a href="https://www.football.london/chelsea-fc/news/former-chelsea-man-united-boss-16919270">he said</a>. "I miss coaching a lot, but I won’t return to working just for the sake of coaching again.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>"I love La Liga and the pride I have to have won this fantastic league is massive.</p>
      <p>"I may have left six years ago but trust me, spiritually, and in the manner I speak of La Liga, I am an ambassador even without the official title of ambassador."</p>
      <h3>Mourinho's 'assurances'</h3>
      <p>A manager of Mourinho's calibre would obviously seek some assurances before accepting a job offer.</p>
      <p>And <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/football/arsenal/story/3976965/sources-jose-mourinho-open-to-replacing-unai-emery-at-arsenal">ESPN</a> claim the Portuguese tactician would want one thing from Daniel Levy...</p>

      <p>...Funds.</p>
      <p>The report states that Mourinho would want assurances from the board that funds were available to allow a serious challenge at silverware.</p>
      <h3>Truth about Mourinho's 'dinner' with Raul Sanllehi</h3>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/arsenal-set-their-sights-on-jose-mourinho-95rwpx0r6">The Times</a>, Arsenal began preparing the ground for a change of management, with 'fractures' appearing between Unai Emery and members of the playing squad.</p>
      <p>The report claimed Arsenal were looking for a manager with strong knowledge of the Premier League who can bring an identity to a squad who were reassembled at significant expense in the summer window.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>And that they were considering a move for Jose Mourinho who dined with head of football Raul Sanlleh.</p>
      <p>However, <b>football.london</b> understands Sanllehi did not have dinner with Mourinho and has not spoken to the former Chelsea manager in years.</p>
      <h3>Mourinho to Bayern Munich?</h3>
      <p>The big news coming out of Germany last month was Bayern Munich parting company with Niko Kovac following a 5-1 loss at Eintracht Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>Mourinho was heavily linked with the vacant position, and so was his long-term rival Pep Guardiola recently.</p>
      <p>And Mourinho had been tipped for the role by former Bayern midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger.</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Former Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>"I can imagine Mourinho in Germany," the former Manchester United star <a href="https://www.dw.com/en/bastian-schweinsteiger-suggests-its-time-for-thomas-m%C3%BCller-to-leave-bayern-munich/a-51097264">said</a>. "I remember he was always asking me about Bayern and the Bundesliga. During our away games, there was always Bundesliga on TV.</p>
      <p>"He really knew every single player, even from the smaller teams. He was also learning German."</p>
      <h3>'Discussions' with Arsenal</h3>
      <p>French outlet <a href="https://twitter.com/SoccerLink_/status/1192027342614474752">Soccerlink</a> claimed Jose Mourinho was in discussions with Arsenal over a potential move.</p>
      <p>With former Gunners boss Arsene Wenger becoming the new favourite to take the Bayern Munich job, Mourinho's options appear to have reduced and the website claims the former Manchester United boss is in talks with the north London side.</p>
      <p><b>football.london</b> understands that this is not the case, however, and Unai Emery's job is safe for now, with the Arsenal hierarchy reluctant to make a managerial change in the middle of the season.</p>
      <h3>Victor Lindelof's admission</h3>
      <p>Manchester United defender Victor Lindelof says he misses working under Jose Mourinho and believes it won't be long before the former Chelsea and United manager returns to football management.</p>
      <p>"He is, after all, one of the world’s best coaches and he is supposed to have a job at one of the biggest clubs. I miss him in football," Lindelof told <a href="https://www.aftonbladet.se/sportbladet/fotboll/a/zGzjXr/lindelof-jag-ville-inte-visa-hur-orolig-jag-var"><i>Aftonbladet</i></a>.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>"He's a great coach and a great person, whom I owe a great deal. It was he who gave me the chance here, who brought me into everything.</p>
      <p>"I have all the respect in the world for him and appreciate everything he has said and done for me, from scolding to a hug.</p>
      <p>"Even if I did not agree, at the time… he has very great charisma, you had great respect for him.</p>
      <p>"He's won everything. When he says something, you listen."</p>
      <h3>Tottenham rumours</h3>
      <p>With Mauricio Pochettino under pressure folloing just three wins in 12 Premier League games, a report in <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/12/exclusive-time-running-pochettinos-tottenham-reign/">The Telegraph</a> suggested Mourinho was being lined up as a potential replacement.</p>
      <p>The report claimed Spurs could turn to Massimiliano Allegri or Mourinho if they were to appoint a replacement mid-season, but making a change at the end of the campaign could hve see Daniel Levy target Bournemouth’s Eddie Howe, RB Leipzig’s Julian Nagelsmann, or England manager Gareth Southgate.</p>
      <h3>Mourinho talks to friends about Spurs job</h3>
      <p>Jose Mourinho reportedly told friends that he would consider taking over at Tottenham ahead of Real Madrid.</p>
      <p>Mauricio Pochettino is under pressure after a poor run of results and performances, and former Chelsea manager Mourinho has been linked with replacing the Spurs boss should he leave.</p>
      <p>Zinedine Zidane's position at Real Madrid is also under scrutiny, with his return not having the desired effect.</p>
      <p>And according to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10360791/jose-mourinho-tottenham-pochettino-real-madrid/">the Sun</a>, Mourinho has doubts over potentially taking the Madrid role.</p>
      <h3>No discussions between Mourinho and Arsenal</h3>
      <p>And French outlet <a href="https://le10sport.com/football/mercato/mercato-real-madrid-lavenir-de-mourinho-serait-deja-tout-trace-481471?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Le10 Sport</a> have now stated that no discussions have been held between Arsenal and Mourinho, as <b>football.london</b> had earlier reported.</p>

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>They also state that Arsenal's 'executive committee' have no plans to remove Unai Emery as manager.</p>
      <p>Mourinho would reportedly consider a move to Spurs if Pochettino were to leave, but he is apparently "destined" to end up back at Real Madrid when Zidane (or Perez) decides enough is enough for a second time.</p>
      <p>Perez will apparently "always keep an eye on Mourinho".</p>
      <h3>Pochettino sacked</h3>
      <p>Mauricio Pochettino was sacked by Tottenham on Tuesday night, with chairman Daneil Levy saying it was not an easy decision.</p>
      <p>Pochettino had led Spurs to the Champions League final at the end of last season, but this season has been a struggle, with Spurs in 14th place ahead of Saturday's game with West Ham.</p>
      <h3>Mourinho the favourite</h3>
      <p>With a manager sacking comes intesne speculation over who will replace him.</p>
      <p>And Jose Mourinho has been installed as the frontrunner to be the next Tottenham boss.</p>
      <p>The market has fluctuated, but Mourinho remains the favourite with Sky Bet, well ahead of the likes of Max Allegri and Eddie Howe in the running.</p>
