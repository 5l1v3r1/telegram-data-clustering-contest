      <p>MADISON, Wis. - State Department of Health Services officials are investigating a significant increase in reported cases of E. coli in the state, according to a news release.</p>
      <p>Officials said they are working with local health departments to interview sick people in an attempt to find commonalities in their behavior that might be the cause of the outbreak.</p>
      <p>According to the release, symptoms of an E. coli infection vary, but can include stomach cramps, diarrhea and vomiting. Roughly 5% to 10% of people who are diagnosed can develop a life-threatening complication that can cause kidney failure and extended periods of hospitalization, the release said.</p>
      <p>DHS officials said you can prevent E. coli by washing your hands before eating or preparing food and after using the restroom. Officials also recommend staying home from work, school or day care when you are sick.</p>
