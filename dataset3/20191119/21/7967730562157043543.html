      <h1>I've tried every adult acne treatment. This is what works</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T21:20:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 21:20</time> by <a rel="author">Sophia Phan</a></address>
      <p>I was one of the many lucky teenagers who had horrible acne growing up – think red, blotchy cheeks exacerbated by my constant picking (the temptation to pick a zit is real).</p>
      <p>After I graduated high school, breakouts seemed to cease, thank god, but every now and then I get the little bugger and always at the least opportune time. Nothing makes you feel more self-aware than a cystic pimple smack bang in the middle of your chin.</p>

      <p>And as we enter party season, lack of sleep combined with poor food choices and copious amounts of alcohol mean it’s inevitable breakouts are going to occur more frequently.</p>
      <p>Dermatologist Dr Anita Patel says the underlying cause of all acne lesions is "a complex interplay between the changing skin microbiome and hormone surges which occur when we transform from children to adults".</p>
      <p>I’ve experimented with a few products, some better than others, to try and zap them out of existence as soon as possible.</p>

      <p>Dr Patel says a cleanser with a slight amount of acid, especially formulated for acne prone skin, is a good step but there’s no one miracle ingredient you should be looking at. She says different acids have different roles “and must be individualised to the patient’s skin type and acne type”.</p>
      <p>Try something like <a href="https://www.neutrogena.com.au/face/washes-cleansers-and-scrubs/visibly-clear-spot-proofing-daily-wash"><b>Neutrogena’s Visibly Clear Spot Proofing Daily Wash</b></a>, <b><a href="https://www.mecca.com.au/dr-dennis-gross/all-in-one-facial-cleanser-with-toner/I-017010.html">Dr Dennis Gross All-In-One Facial Cleanser With Toner </a></b>or <a href="https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/aspect/aspect-purastat-5-cleanser.html"><b>Aspect Purastat 5 Cleanser</b></a>.</p>
      <p>DECIEM’s CEO and co-founder, Nicola Kilner, agrees. “There is an array of ingredients that can be used to address different types of blemishes. The choice of ingredient takes into account skin type, blemish type and the severity of the skin concern. Common ingredients to target the look of blemishes include niacinamide and salicylic acid."</p>
      <p>I’m a big fan of topical treatments because I have zero patience and like to see instant results. I have a preferred method depending on the type of breakout, be it cystic, blackhead or whitehead.</p>
      <p>I’ve found <a href="https://www.sephora.com/product/the-ordinary-deciem-salicylic-acid-2-solution-P427407"><b>The Ordinary’s Salicylic Acid 2% Solution </b></a>to be super effective on small bumps and cystic pimples. I like to apply it onto clean, dry skin before bed and when I wake up in the morning – voila! They’ve either shrunken or disappeared completely.</p>
      <p>But be careful with this product: it’s not nice when you apply too much. "Overusing Salicylic Acid will result in excessive exfoliation of the skin. This may lead to negative side effects, including dry skin and signs of inflammation," says Ms Kilner.</p>
      <p>I once applied a liberal amount to a spot on the side of my forehead and woke up with the driest, crustiest looking rash near my eye. I told colleagues I must have been bitten by a bug. Oops. So learn from my mistake.</p>
      <p>Another favourite is <a href="https://www.dermalogica.com.au/overnight-clearing-gel/"><b>Dermalogica’s Overnight Clearing Gel</b></a>; it’s gentler on the skin but much dearer and I find it runs out quicker.</p>
      <p>Both treatments will make your skin tingle ever the slightest, but there’s no pain otherwise.</p>

      <p>If you don’t trust yourself with applying treatment or you’re a pimple picker (which is a big no-no!), pimple patches may be the way to go. They’re pretty new on the beauty scene, but I can confirm they’re a lot of fun.</p>
      <p>I use the <a href="https://www.amazon.com.au/Cosrx-Pimple-Master-Patch-Patches/dp/B00PBX3TN6"><b>CORSX</b> <b>Acne Pimple Master Patch </b></a>whenever I have an under-skin bump or a whitehead that’s about to erupt. It’s inexpensive and comes in different sizes depending how big a breakdown you’re about to have. It’s a hydrocolloid patch which means it’ll absorb all the gunk from the pimple and promote healing.</p>
      <p>They’re easy to use and are flesh-coloured so are not too noticeable on the face – I’ve often gone to wash my face in the morning and forgotten I had applied them in the first place.</p>
      <p>My only issue with them is that they’re not always a guarantee - sometimes you just get a bugger that’s so large that it may require multiple patch applications.</p>
      <p>If subtlety is not your thing, I recommend either the <a href="https://www.mecca.com.au/mario-badescu/drying-lotion/I-004684.html?gclid=EAIaIQobChMImK3T9I7z5QIVwRErCh16ywQHEAQYASABEgKhCfD_BwE"><b>Mario Badescu Drying Lotion </b></a>or <b><a href="https://www.mecca.com.au/kate-somerville/eradikate-acne-treatment/I-013686.html">Kate Somerville</a><a href="https://www.mecca.com.au/kate-somerville/eradikate-acne-treatment/I-013686.html">EradiKate Acne Treatment </a></b>- both fabulous at zapping whiteheads.</p>
      <p>If you absolutely can’t resist popping that pimple, let an expert attend to it. I promise it will be equally satisfying. I like to think that I have a pretty good pain threshold, but I’m not going to lie: this process is painful. The facialist uses the holy trinity of pressure, physics and old-fashioned determination to prick and squeeze the gunk from your pores.</p>
      <p>"It's all about the stretching of the skin and the right angle on how to use the needle to open the pore," says skin expert Carina Gross from Belameres.</p>
      <p>"One of the main mistakes I've seen is that too much pressure is used instead of using the right way of piercing the skin. Your skin can easily break if you use too much pressure and that will leave a mark and potentially a scar.</p>
      <p>"I always advice against squeezing at home as it usually causes even more breakouts and makes it worse. If someone just likes to get some blackheads on the nose I don't mind it as long as they don't break the skin."</p>

      <p>Ms Gross, who performs up to 10 extractions a day, says there have been instances whereby the pimples have popped in her face, but over the years she's learned how to avoid them.</p>
      <p>I asked if she had any other memorable experiences.</p>
      <p>"I'd say the ones that come out easily (usually on an oily skin) and heal quickly are the most satisfying ones as I love getting results. Sometimes I think clients must feel so much lighter after getting so much gunk out of the skin."</p>
      <p>To make your life less painful and reduce the frequency of spots, dermatologist Dr Patel says you should try to adopt these habits:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Wash your skin twice a day with the right cleanser, and especially after exercising</li>
        <li>Don't fiddle with the spots</li>
        <li>Don't steam your face</li>
        <li>Eat a healthy diet, avoiding excessive dairy</li>
        <li>Get some sleep</li>
      </ul>
