      <h1>Rainbow Six Siege gets a free weekend and a new event to promote Netflix’s Money Heist</h1>

        <b>Rainbow Six Siege is about to get yet another free weekend, but this time it’s also a massive cross-promotional event for Netflix’s Money Heist. Don’t worry, you’re not alone if you haven’t heard of Money Heist before – the show aired on Spanish television before making the jump to Netflix earlier this year. Either way, you’ve got a new event mode and cosmetics to enjoy for the duration of the event.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Money Heist (or La Casa de Papel, depending on your region) event begins on November 20 and runs through November 25. You’ll play a special edition of Hostage mode set on the Bank map, except the Hostage is now wearing the red suit and mask from the show. You’ll also be able to pick up red suit and Dali mask outfits for Vigil and Hibana, as well as other cosmetics.</p>
      <p>While they’re promotional, you’ll still have to pay for the new bundles: 1680 R6 credits, to be precise. You will get savings elsewhere, though – the game itself will be up to 70% off depending on what version you’re looking at, and you’ll also be able to play Siege for free between November 21 and November 25.</p>
      <p>Check out a trailer for the event below. (Or the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bym2k19GsZ8&amp;feature=youtu%0A%0A.be">mirrored video</a>, as we continue our ongoing battle with Ubisoft’s region locks.)</p>

      <p>You can also get more details on the <a href="https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/news/152-357580-16/new-in-game-event-money-heist">official site</a>.</p>
      <p>Siege remains one of the biggest and best <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/15-best-pc-first-person-shooters">FPS games</a> out there, so it makes some sense to see other companies reach out for the cross-promotional possibilities – weird as they may be. At the very least, it’s an excuse to get back in for a new free event.</p>
