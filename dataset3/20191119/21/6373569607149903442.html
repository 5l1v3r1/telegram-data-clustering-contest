      <p>A man who started a fire in a shed next to the home of his sleeping ex-partner has denied he meant to put her at any risk.</p>
      <p>Brian Brooks, aged 51, told a jury he only intended to melt a plastic bag on top of her tumble drier.</p>
      <p>But a court has heard that the fire spread after he ran away from the house in <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/plymstock">Plymstock</a>.</p>
      <p>The woman said she <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/plymouth-news/sleeping-womans-shed-burned-down-3551843">ran in a panic to a neighbour’s house</a> at about 10pm at night. She had been dozing in front of the television when the fire tripped the electricity.</p>
      <p>Brooks is on trial at Plymouth Crown Court after he denied arson reckless as to whether life was endangered on April 5 this year. He has admitted arson.</p>
      <p>Brooks, of Quarry Park Road in Plymstock, has also denied leaving her in fear with unwanted calls and social media messages between February and April.</p>

      <p>Asked what he wanted when he started the fire, Brooks said: “I wanted the bag to melt and leave a puddle of plastic on top of the tumble drier and that’s it.”</p>
      <p>His barrister Ali Rafati asked: “Did you foresee any risk to life when you started the fire?”</p>
      <p>Brooks replied that he did not.</p>
      <p>Mr Rafati asked whether he knew she was asleep in the lounge at the time.</p>
      <p>He admitted peering through her window but added: “I did not see anyone in there.”</p>
      <p>The court heard that the couple had been together for about 14 months and lived together at her house in Jenkins Close for six.</p>
      <p>The woman said they split on February 9 and claimed Brooks messaged her and phoned her despite saying she wanted no contact.</p>
      <p>She added she was “terrified” and worried what he would do next.</p>
      <p>The ex-partner told the jury: “I was really concerned for my safety and I did not know where this would lead.”</p>
      <p>The woman said she was dozing in front of the television in her lounge when the set went off. She awoke to find all the power had gone off.</p>
      <p>She added: “I heard a huge bang and I looked out of the window to see a huge ball of flame.”</p>
      <p>The trial continues.</p>
