      <p>Chocolate and barbecue might seem like an unlikely combination, but one restaurant in Tomball, Texas is doing both. <br/><br/>Scott Moore and partner Michelle Holland don't just own one of the top 10 barbecue joints in the South, they also founded Texas' very first bean-to-bar craft chocolatier.<br/><br/>Even better? Both businesses are under one roof. One side of the hot-spot is devoted to every step of the chocolate making process, from roasting to grinding to melting. The other side you'll find a 3,000 pound tank smoker of classic beef, pork and ribs. <br/><br/>People travel from as far away as Europe and Asia to stand in line for the one-of kind experience of <a href="https://abc13.com/food/tejas-chocolate-and-bbq-serves-up-unlikely-combination/2660934/">Tejas Chocolate and Barbecue</a>.</p>
