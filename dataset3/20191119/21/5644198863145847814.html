      <p>Only 14 months ago Italians were wondering where national coach Roberto Mancini was going to find enough quality players to produce a team worthy of the country's history.</p>
      <p>REUTERS: Only 14 months ago Italians were wondering where national coach Roberto Mancini was going to find enough quality players to produce a team worthy of the country's history.</p>
      <p>Their biggest names were well into their thirties while the most promising youngsters were stuck in the reserves at Serie A clubs. "The use of Italians has never been so low," he said at the time.</p>

      <p>Now Mancini's biggest headache is who he will leave out of the 23-man squad that will head for Euro 2020 in June.</p>
      <p>Few coaches have rebuilt a team as quickly and as impressively as Mancini, who took over in May last year with Italy in disarray after their failing to qualify for the 2018 World Cup.</p>
      <p>After losing 1-0 to Portugal in September last year, their fourth competitive match without a win, there was a feeling not even Mancini could rescue them. "Italy always going downwards," said Gazzetta dello Sport.</p>
      <p>Yet Italy stormed through their Euro qualifying group with a perfect record, culminating in Monday's 9-1 demolition of Armenia, and are on a record-breaking run of 11 successive wins.</p>
      <p>The 54-year-old coach has shown remarkable faith in young players and a talent for injecting confidence and helping them to perform to the best of their ability.</p>
      <p>Over 19 matches he has selected 65 players and given international debuts to 24.</p>
      <p>FULL OF PROMISE</p>
      <p>Among those was Nicolo Zaniolo, who was called up last year before he had even made his Serie A debut.</p>
      <p>Zaniolo, who scored his first two Italy goals against Armenia, is now regarded as one of the most promising players Italy has produced in recent years.</p>
      <p>More surprising is that Mancini has given chances to late developers such as forward Kevin Lasagna and defender Armando Izzo, who made their Italy debuts at 26 and 27 respectively.</p>
      <p>Last month Mancini also called up 26-year-old Giovanni Di Lorenzo, who reached Serie A only last season after spells with Empoli in Serie B and Matera in the third tier of Italian soccer.</p>
      <p>"Something special has happened. We have won all the games with a squad that people did not have much faith in," Mancini said.</p>
      <p>"I think the public have taken to them because they are young lads, from so many different teams. They've played well and kept a high standard."</p>
      <p>Brazilian-born midfielder Jorginho said Italy's adventurous style - far removed from their dour tradition - had also won over the public.</p>
      <p>"There is a little bit of Brazil in this team," he said. "Our mentality is to attack, enjoy ourselves and always look to score."</p>
