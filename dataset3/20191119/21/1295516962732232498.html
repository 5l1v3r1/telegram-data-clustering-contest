      <h1>Star Wars: Kevin Feige Was the One Who Approached Lucasfilm</h1>

      <p>One would think that, based on Marvel's success, that Lucasfilm was the one that approached <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/kevin-feige/">Kevin Feige</a> to develop a <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/star-wars/"><i>Star Wars</i></a> film. However, Kathleen Kennedy, president of Lucasfilm, confirmed that it was actually Feige who came up with the idea.</p>
      <p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-features/lucasfilm-president-kathleen-kennedy-interview-rise-skywalker-future-star-wars-912393/"><i>Rolling Stone</i></a>, Kennedy explained that is Feige's passion for the franchise that led him to approach the studio.</p>

      <p>"Kevin has been a huge fan of <i>Star Wars,</i> and he’s made that pretty clear, she said. "He talked to us, and he talked to the studio and said, 'You know, is there any chance I could step in and do one of the <i>Star Wars</i> movies?' And I thought it was a pretty cool idea. So we’re just beginning to talk about what that might be and when that might be." Kennedy also added that this movie or movies are still far into the future.</p>
