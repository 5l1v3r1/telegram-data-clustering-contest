      <p><b>TOKYO — </b>Japan needs to compile an extraordinary budget of more than 10 trillion yen ($92 billion) for the current fiscal year through March in a bid to bolster the economy, a senior ruling party official said Tuesday.</p>
      <p>"As uncertainty grows about the economic outlook, (the government) cannot remove the public's anxiety without a large-scale supplementary budget," Toshihiro Nikai, secretary general of the Liberal Democratic Party, said at a news conference.</p>
      <p>Nikai, who holds the LDP's No. 2 post after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, stressed the importance of strengthening infrastructure-building and reconstruction efforts in the face of increasingly severe natural disasters hitting the country.</p>
      <p>The government is crafting the budget for fiscal 2019 to assist reconstruction in areas devastated by a series of disasters this year, including deadly Typhoon Hagibis in October.</p>
      <p>Finance Minister Taro Aso, however, questioned Nikai's suggestion, telling reporters that Nikai needs to show fiscal sources for the proposed budget.</p>
      <p>"Where would 10 trillion yen come from?" asked Aso, who doubles as deputy prime minister.</p>
      <p>The scale of Nikai's plan compares with the country's 101.46 trillion yen initial budget for fiscal 2019.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, Abe instructed ministers to draw up an economic package to cushion downside risks at home and abroad, including the impact of the Oct 1 increase in the consumption tax to 10 percent from 8 percent.</p>
      <p>The government plans to earmark necessary funds for the package in the fiscal 2019 supplementary budget and in the fiscal 2020 budget.</p>
