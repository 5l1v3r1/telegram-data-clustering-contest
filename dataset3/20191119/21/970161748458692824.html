      <p>Elton John is currently enjoying a whistlestop visit to the UK where he is promoting his new autobiography.</p>
      <p>And while he’s over in the capital, the 72-year-old has been sure to meet up with some of his A-lister pals.</p>
      <p>Yes, before taking to the stage in London, where he’ll be talking with David Walliams all about his life, the Honky Cat hitmaker caught up with the likes of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/lewis-hamilton/">Lewis Hamilton</a>.</p>
      <p>Taking to his Instagram story, the living legend shared a series of pictures from the evening, where he embraced the Formula One driver ahead of his show.</p>
      <p>The pair were dressed to the nines in snazzy suits, as Elton wore a chequered pink blazer and trousers, that he’d matched with a pair of his iconic oversized, orange-tinted glasses.</p>

      <p>In a snap of them looking overwhelmed to be meeting each other, the Your Song singer wrote: ‘Hello @LewisHamilton.’</p>
      <p>Following this, he then shared an iconic reunion with Kiki Dee, who he duetted with back in 1976 on his track Don’t Go Breaking My Heart.</p>
      <p>In the caption, he wrote: ‘Let’s have a Kiki.’</p>

      <p>The pictures come after Elton opened up about his recent health scare, that left him 24 hours away from death.</p>
      <p>During his battle with prostate cancer, the Rocketman had a build up of fluid under his colon, which left him in excruciating pain and needing to wear a nappy on stage as he performed in Las Vegas in 2017.</p>
      <p>Talking on the BBC One documentary Uncensored, Elton said: ‘I went to South America and played in Santiago and I came home, and I got to London and I was very ill. And I was rushed into hospital on intensive care.</p>
      <p>‘I picked up an awful bug from somewhere. And I was about 24 hours from snuffing it. We didn’t tell people that was going on at the time, so I had an annus horribilis as they say for half the year.</p>
      <p>‘I literally had to learn how to walk again. I was extremely sick. All I could think about when I was lying in my hospital bed was “please don’t let me die, I want to see my children”, and luckily I survived it.</p>

      <p>‘Now I’m fine but there’s very few bits of me left. There’s no hair, there’s a pacemaker, there’s no tonsils, there’s no prostate, there’s no appendix, I’ve had kidney stones. I’m like the Bionic Woman.’</p>
