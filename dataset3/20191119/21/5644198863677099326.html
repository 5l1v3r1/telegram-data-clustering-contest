      <p>The army of banks working on Saudi Aramco's listing will earn combined fees of US$90 million or less, according to three sources involved in the process, after the oil giant scaled back a deal initially viewed as a golden opportunity for high finance.</p>
      <p>DUBAI/LONDON: The army of banks working on Saudi Aramco's listing will earn combined fees of US$90 million or less, according to three sources involved in the process, after the oil giant scaled back a deal initially viewed as a golden opportunity for high finance.</p>
      <p>The fee pool for the flotation of the world's most profitable company contrasts with other blockbuster listings in recent years. China's Alibaba , for example, paid out an estimated US$300 million for its 2014 listing in New York.</p>

      <p>The 25 banks hired by Aramco as bookrunners for its domestic initial public offering (IPO) have seen their projected payouts dwindle despite spending years working on the much-delayed marquee listing.</p>
      <p>Saudi Arabia originally put the state company's value at US$2 trillion, but this was revised down to a maximum of US$1.7 trillion. Aramco decided on Sunday that it would offer only 1.5per cent of the company - below the expected 2per cent.</p>
      <p>It also canceled marketing events in developed markets like the United States and Britain, turning its back on most international investment.</p>
      <p>The banks will be paid 35 basis points of the money raised, according to the three sources. This would be around US$90 million if the company prices at the top of its range, raising US$25.6 billion - still making it the biggest IPO in history.</p>
      <p>Aramco did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
      <p>If bankers had met certain milestones, including helping the company achieve a US$2 trillion valuation and sell 2per cent of the company - now impossible feats - banks would have been entitled to be paid 50 basis points, the three sources said.</p>
      <p>That meant fees could have been in excess of US$200 million.</p>
      <p>The fee pool is below that paid out by retail titan Alibaba to 35 banks working on its 2014 deal, which raised US$25 billion. Facebook , meanwhile, paid out an estimated US$176 million to 30 banks for its 2012 IPO, which raised US$16 billion.</p>
      <p>While Aramco was always anticipated to pay a less lucrative rate, the sheer volume of shares on sale and expectation there would be sizeable participation by international investors meant banks would have expected a far higher return.</p>
      <p>FIERCE COMPETITION</p>
      <p>The lead nine lead banks will likely get the bulk of fees. They include Citi , Goldman Sachs , Morgan Stanley , JPMorgan as well as Saudi players National Commercial Bank , SAMBA Financial Group .</p>
      <p>Some of the international junior bookrunners could walk away with very little as share sales to non-Saudi investors will be limited.</p>
      <p>One of three sources said that Aramco on Sunday gave banks a 76-hour deadline to confirm whether they would stay on the deal.</p>
      <p>Some banks are still trying to secure investment from Western funds, a fourth source said, adding it was unlikely that Aramco would ditch any banks at this advanced stage unless they asked to drop out.</p>
      <p>One consolation could be that the listing will at least help their standing in equity capital market league tables.</p>
      <p>Investment banks have competed fiercely for mandates from Aramco ever since Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in 2016 announced a plan to sell a 5per cent stake, including in an overseas listing, as a cornerstone of an ambitious drive to diversify the economy of the world's largest oil exporter.</p>
      <p>Aramco said it postponed a listing in 2018 to acquire 70per cent of petrochemicals giant Saudi Basic Industries , a move seen as a bid to boost the firm's valuation.</p>
      <p>Preparations were revived this summer after the firm attracted huge interest in its first international bond sale, seen as a pre-IPO relationship-building exercise with investors, and the company began mandating the large number of banks.</p>
      <p>NO GLOBETROTTING</p>
      <p>Bankers had anticipated spending much of this week globetrotting with Aramco management round meetings with investors â€“ a presentation had been scheduled for Wednesday at London's Savoy Hotel and on Thursday at the St Regis in New York according to invitations seen by Reuters.</p>
      <p>But all marketing events outside the Middle East region were canceled on Saturday.</p>
      <p>"Almost all of the book will be domestic, although some QFIs may come," a fifth source said, referring to Qualified Foreign Investors allowed to invest in Saudi securities.</p>
      <p>However foreign funds do not tend to value Saudi companies as highly as local investors, partly because they are wary of regional risks, the source said.</p>
      <p>Such risks came to the fore when Aramco's facilities were attacked in September, initially halving oil output. Saudi Arabia blamed arch-rival Iran, which denied involvement.</p>
      <p>Saudi banks such as National Commercial Bank, SAMBA and Al Rajhi will cash in on selling the bulk of shares to locals and providing them with financing.</p>
