      <p>The Tiger Paddlers scored a 3-0 romp of University of the Philippines before returning in the afternoon session with a 3-1 victory over National University.</p>
      <p>UST remains on course of winning back-to-back and a record 28th crown.</p>
      <p>Despite losing twice in the final day of the eliminations, the Bulldogs (11-3) will still have the twice-to-beat bonus in the step-ladder semifinals for being ranked No. 2.</p>
      <p>NU suffered a shock 2-3 loss to Adamson University in the morning session.</p>
      <p>De La Salle finished strong in the eliminations after identical 3-0 wins over Ateneo and University of the East.</p>
      <p>The Falcons then tied with the Green Paddlers at 9-5 following a 3-0 tripping of the Blue Eagles.</p>
      <p>De La Salle and Adamson University clash in a do-or-die tie at 9 a.m. Tuesday. The winner will face the Bulldogs at 1 p.m. Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The best-of-three Finals will be played on Wednesday starting at 9 a.m.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, back-to-back title-seeking University of Santo Tomas avenged its lone loss of the season with a 3-1 conquest of Ateneo Monday at the Blue Eagle Gym.</p>
      <p>The Tigress Paddlers swept the second round of the eliminations and finished with a league-best 13-1 record.</p>
      <p>UST, which defeated University of the East, 3-0, earlier in the day, will face Far Eastern University in the Final Four at 9 a.m. on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Ateneo stunned De La Salle, 3-0, in a playoff to secure the remaining twice-to-beat slot in the Final Four. The vastly-improved Lady Eagles and the Lady Paddlers ended the elims with identical 11-3 records.</p>
      <p>Ateneo placed sixth last year.</p>
      <p>The Tigresses and the Lady Eagles need only to win once to make it to the best-of-three championship series on Wednesday. The deciding Final Four tie, if needed, will be played at 1 p.m. on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The Lady Tamaraws claimed the last semifinals berth after hurdling the last two elimination round matches.</p>
      <p>Prior to scoring a narrow 3-2 win over De La Salle that sealed a semis duel with UST, FEU opened the day with a 3-0 decision of Adamson University.</p>
      <p>In the morning ties, the Lady Eagles beat National University, 3-0, while the Lady Paddlers downed University of the Philippines, 3-0.</p>
      <p>The Tigresses are gunning for a 14th championship.</p>
