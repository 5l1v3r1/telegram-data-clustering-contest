      <p>Plymouth Argyle will play away to Graham Coughlan’s Bristol Rovers in the FA Cup second round.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/plymouth-argyle">The Pilgrims</a> will travel to the Memorial Stadium on Sunday, December 1 for a 2pm kick-off.</p>
      <p>That follows Rovers’ 1-0 win at National League high-fliers Bromley in their first round replay at Hayes Lane on Tuesday night.</p>

      <p>Striker Jonson Clarke-Harris got the only goal of the game as early as the third minute.</p>
      <p>He bundled the ball home form close range after a cross from the right by midfielder Ollie Clarke.</p>
      <p>The replay was televised live on BT Sport, with Argyle manager Ryan Lowe a special guest as part of their coverage.</p>
      <p>There will be £54,000 prize money at stake when the Pilgrims take on Rovers on December 1.</p>
      <p>It will be the fourth time that Argyle have played Rovers in 2019, although the three previous occasions were all at Home Park.</p>
      <p>The first was a League One fixture in March, when Gavin Reilly grabbed a stoppage time equaliser for the visitors in a 2-2 draw.</p>
      <p>Argyle hosted Rovers in pre-season at the end of July in what was Lowe’s first home match as manager and lost 1-0.</p>
      <p>Then, in early September, Rovers returned to Home Park for an EFL Trophy group game, which ended in a 1-1 draw after 90 minutes.</p>
      <p>The Pilgrims then went on to win the subsequent penalty shoot-out 5-3.</p>

      <p>The last time that Argyle met Rovers in the FA Cup was in December 2001 when they lost 3-2 in a second round replay at the Memorial Stadium despite two goals from David Friio.</p>
      <p>Current Rovers' boss Coughlan was part of the Pilgrims' defence that night.</p>
