      <h2>Brit backpacker Grace Millane drank so much alcohol on the Tinder date that she may not have fought for breath while being choked, a court in New Zealand has heard</h2>

      <p>British backpacker Grace Millane's may not have resisted being strangled to death because of the amount of alcohol she had drank, a court heard.</p>
      <p>A 27-year-old man is currently on trial for murdering the traveller after a Tinder date, although he claims she died by accident during rough sex.</p>
      <p>Grace, 22, drank so much during their date that her heart may have gone into a “terminal tailspin” when she was choked during sex, Auckland High Court heard today.</p>
      <p>Renowned pathologist Dr Fintan Garavan, appearing as an expert defence witness, told the jury a combination of obstruction of the bloodflow, pressure on her nervous system and the British backpacker being drunk meant she might have died quickly.</p>

      <p>There were no signs of her having struggled and her plight “would not be obvious to a person nearby unless you know what you are looking for,” said Dr Garavan.</p>
      <p>Defence barrister Ian Brookie said Grace, a university graduate from Wickford in Essex, had drunk four mango cocktails, one tequila shot, two whisky cocktails herself and shared three half litre jugs of margaritas and sangria with her alleged killer during their night out.</p>
      <p>Dr Garavan said the alcohol, in conjunction with the choking, was “an iceberg making its way into the shipping lane.”</p>

      <p>“It very likely has become an important indirect player in causing death,” he said, explaining that being drunk could turn off a “safety valve” which would normally trigger someone to fight for breath.</p>
      <p>Dr Garavan, who examined hundreds of photographs of Grace’s body, agreed the primary cause of death was asphyxiation, which he said would have required just one kilogram of pressure.</p>
      <p>But he said the absence of deeper haemorrhages in the neck muscles, fractures or scratches to the skin “would favour consensual” choking.</p>
      <p>“All those factors together could explain how this young lady has passed,” he said, saying there may have been few outward signs. “If a person is affected in this way they may just stop moving, become unresponsive.”</p>
      <p>Under cross-examination, Dr Garavan agreed that once that happened, the hold on their neck would have continue for several minutes before death occurred.</p>
      <p>“You would expect a sober person would notice something but necessarily a drunk person,” he said.</p>
      <p>Earlier today the court heard that Grace was a member of two BDSM dating websites and was on one of them just an hour before she met the defendant for their date.</p>

      <p>Prosecutors claim the accused deliberately killed the Brit before stuffing her body into a suitcase and burying it in a shallow grave in bushland outside Auckland, New Zealand.</p>
      <p>The defendant's lawyer said his client disposed of Grace's body in a panic after finding her dead in his room, however he denies deliberately killing her in December last year.</p>
      <p>The trial continues.</p>
