      <p>NEW YORK, Nov 19 — Taylor Swift’s former label said yesterday that it will allow the global pop superstar to perform some of her early hits at an awards show this month — the latest twist in a months-long public feud over the rights to her first six albums.</p>
      <p>But even the seeming resolution of the spat did not come without some confusion.</p>
      <p>The Big Machine Label Group released what it called a joint statement with Dick Clark Productions — which puts on the American Music Awards — saying they had “reached a licensing agreement” that would allow Swift to sing what she wants at the November 24 ceremony.</p>
      <p>But shortly thereafter, the producers distanced themselves from the situation, saying it was between Swift and her ex-label.</p>
      <p>Big Machine, which is based in Nashville, then clarified that it had “informed” the production company of its licensing approval.</p>
      <p>Swift’s publicist did not immediately respond to an AFP request for comment, and the pop star has yet to react publicly.</p>
      <p>Last week, Swift — known for her calculating social media strategy — said on Tumblr that Big Machine heads were “exercising tyrannical control” over her.</p>
      <p>She claimed they had told her she was “not allowed to perform my old songs on television because they claim that would be re-recording my music before I’m allowed to next year.”</p>
      <p>The pop superstar — famous for megahits like <i>Shake It Off</i> and <i>We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together</i> — also said Big Machine was preventing her from using “older music or performance footage” for a Netflix project.</p>
      <p>The company, which did not refer to the Netflix issue in its latest statements, denied the allegations last week.</p>
      <p>“It should be noted that recording artists do not need label approval for live performances on television or any other live media,” Big Machine said yesterday.</p>
      <p>“Record label approval is only needed for contracted artists’ audio and visual recordings and in determining how those works are distributed.”</p>
      <p>Swift began publicly sparring with industry mogul Scooter Braun this summer over his purchase of her former label of more than a decade, which gave him a majority stake in the master recordings of her first six albums.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old then vowed to re-record her early albums to create copies she owns herself, saying her contract allows her to begin redoing albums one through five in November 2020 — when she plans to be back in the studio doing just that.</p>
      <p>Swift signed a new deal with Universal Music Group in 2018 that gave her ownership of her masters going forward, including for her recently released seventh album <b>Lover</b>. — AFP</p>
