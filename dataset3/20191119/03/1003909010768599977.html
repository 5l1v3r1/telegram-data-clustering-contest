      <h1>Council to debate pilot of private garbage collection</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T03:32:42+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 03:32</time> by <a rel="author">Meghan Potkins, Calgary Herald</a></address>
      <p>City council is set to debate a proposal that could see private garbage collection piloted in some Calgary communities starting in 2021.</p>
      <p>Ten council members are backing the motion instructing the city to contract-out up to 25 per cent of black cart waste collection. The proposal is expected to be debated at council Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The city previously studied the possibility of moving to privatized waste and recycling collection. A consultant’s report from earlier this year <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/committee-offers-chilly-response-to-report-on-privatized-garbage-collection">found the cost savings of switching to private collection would be minor</a>.</p>
      <p>But proponents of the motion are skeptical of the report and favour estimates provided by industry.</p>
      <p>“This motion is about creating a competitive environment, so that we can compare apples-to-apples finally between how (the city) services and how someone else services,” said Coun. Ward Sutherland on Monday.</p>
      <p>“It’s about time we start looking at efficiencies and looking at these comparable and that’s what it’s about.”</p>
      <p>A pilot program would need to be seven years, Sutherland said, since companies would be unlikely to bid without the assurance of sufficient time to make a return on the investment in equipment and hiring.</p>
      <p>Mayor Naheed Nenshi said he isn’t opposed to a pilot but disagreed with the way the proposal was brought to council as a matter of urgent business.</p>
      <p>“I do not like how this is coming to council, without any public consultation, without any opportunity for city workers to give us their opinion on the matter or to organize,” said Nenshi.</p>
      <p>“I’m not saying I’m opposed to it, I am saying that I don’t like sneaking it in.”</p>
