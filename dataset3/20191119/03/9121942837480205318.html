      <p>BERLIN (AP) — German authorities have raided the homes and offices of six businesspeople and bankers as part of an investigation into a massive tax fraud scheme.</p>
      <p>Hesse state prosecutors said Tuesday in addition to 12 searches in Hesse and Bavaria, an apartment was searched in the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>The suspects, aged between 50 and 57, are accused of bilking the government of 53.3 million euros ($59 million) in taxes in 2008-9 through so-called cum-ex transactions where participants would lend each other shares to collect reimbursement for taxes they hadn’t paid.</p>
      <p>The funds have already been repaid by the legal successor of the Frankfurt-based investment company involved.</p>
      <p>German authorities are conducting multiple cum-ex investigations after a Swiss bank’s employee leaked documents to journalists detailing the scheme that allegedly cost European countries 55.2 billion euros.</p>
      <p>The searches are separate from others conducted Tuesday connected to money laundering.</p>
