      <p>Titans winger Phillip Sami has locked in to another two years with the Gold Coast side.</p>
      <p>The fastest Titans player ever will now stay on the coast until the end of the 2022, despite getting chased by a number of rival clubs.</p>
      <p>The Ipswich junior says it was an easy decision for him, and he’s looking forward to being a part of the Titans’ resurgence under new coach Justin Holbrook.</p>
      <p>“Obviously I had decisions to make in the off-season and the start of the pre-season.</p>
      <p>“I went back to the family, and they are very happy that I am staying home. I am very grateful for the opportunity that Justin has given me. Hopefully I can make the most of it here.</p>
      <p>“On the off-season I had other clubs chasing me, and pretty much in the last two weeks my manager went back to the Titans – as in Ezra (Recruitment Manager Ezra Howe) and Justin – and told them the situation I was in.</p>
      <p>“I was thankful that the Titans came back with an offer. For me, choosing to stay home is a big part of what I want to do here. I know this club has a big future, so I wanted to be a part of it,” Sami said.</p>
      <p>He’s now working on making sure other Gold Coast juniors, like the off-contract AJ Brimson, follow his lead and stay with the Titans.</p>
      <p>“I had a word with him about it, so hopefully he stays too,” Sami said.</p>
