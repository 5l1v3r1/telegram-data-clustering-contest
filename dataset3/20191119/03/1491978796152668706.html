        <i>Incident comes less than a week after Northern Territory officer fatally shot Kumanjayi Walker in Yuendumu</i>
      </p>
      <p>A 23-year-old Indigenous man is in a serious but stable condition after he was hit by a police vehicle in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/northern-territory">Northern Territory</a> on Monday night.</p>
      <p>At about 8.30pm on Monday police said officers responded to reports of an armed man at a business in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/alice-springs">Alice Springs</a>.</p>
      <p>In a statement, NT police said: “Vehicles attended and in the process of attempting to apprehend the man there was a collision with the man and one of the vehicles.”</p>
      <p>“Police administered first aid until St Johns Ambulance arrived and transported the man to hospital.”</p>
      <p>The man suffered head injuries in the collision, and was taken to the Royal Adelaide hospital in South Australia.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson from SA Health confirmed the man remained in hospital in a serious but stable condition.</p>
      <p>Police have confirmed they are investigating the incident, saying it is being treated as “a serious custody incident” with oversight by the territory’s Professional Standards Command.</p>
      <p>“The circumstances surrounding the incident are being investigated, and no further information is available at this time,” police said.</p>
      <p>It comes little more than a week after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/13/yuendumu-shooting-nt-policeman-charged-with-over-death-of-indigenous-man">the fatal shooting of Kumanjayi Walker by a NT police officer in Yuendumu</a>, a town located around 300km north-west of Alice Springs.</p>
      <p>An officer was charged with Walker’s murder last week after the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/14/kumanjayi-walker-nt-chief-minister-urges-calm-ahead-of-rally-over-yuendumu-police-shooting">death prompted widespread anger</a> in the Territory and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/14/kumanjayi-walker-nt-chief-minister-urges-calm-ahead-of-rally-over-yuendumu-police-shooting">large-scale protests in Alice Springs</a>.</p>
