      <h1>Newt Gingrich: Pelosi, Schiff and Democrats 'living out their fantasies' with impeachment inquiry</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T03:18:35+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 03:18</time> by <a rel="author">Victor Garcia</a></address>
      <p>Former House Speaker <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/newt-gingrich-remembering-gettysburg">Newt Gingrich</a> slammed House Democrats, Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., Monday, saying they were "living out their fantasies" through the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry">Trump impeachment inquiry</a>.</p>
      <p>"They have an absolute deep, passionate need ... I would argue a pathological need, to try to destroy the president, even if in the process they cripple themselves," Gingrich said on "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/shows/hannity">Hannity</a>." "This is a drama in which Schiff and Pelosi and others are living out their fantasies largely out of desperation, because I think deep down, they think Trump is going to get reelected."</p>

      <p>Gingrich also claimed Democrats do not care about "facts" or "arguments," added that the whole proceedings weren't "real."</p>
      <p>"They're just faced with a nightmare. And so none of this stuff is real. People shouldn't judge it as real," Gingrich said. "It's a theater and it's a theater of hate [for] Trump led by Schiff and Pelosi."</p>
      <p>The House Intelligence Committee will hold the first of five hearings <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/impeachment-hearings-democrats-week-ahead-contradictions">Tuesday morning</a>. Eight witnesses -- including several who have provided inconsistent accounts of key events -- are set to testify over three days in what could be a make-or-break week in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/house-of-representatives/democrats">House Democrats</a>' impeachment investigation.</p>
      <p>To add to the drama, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-hell-strongly-consider-pelosi-invite-to-testify-in-impeachment-hearings">President Trump tweeted Monday</a> he would “strongly consider” testifying or providing written answers to questions after Pelosi challenged him to testify before Congress if he wants to set the record straight.</p>
      <p>On Monday, Gingrich argued the inquiry would ultimately affect the American news media the most.</p>

      <p>"I think the biggest impact, ironically, may be the destruction of the American news media," Gingrich said. "Over 50 percent of the country now sees the news media as deliberately anti-Trump, having no interest in the facts, not covering the news, [and] serving as propaganda."</p>
      <p>"I mean, the news media today is weaker than it's been at any time in my lifetime," Gingrich added. "And that ultimately is a huge disadvantage for the Democrats because the Democrats are in a position where they need the news media to be believable."</p>
