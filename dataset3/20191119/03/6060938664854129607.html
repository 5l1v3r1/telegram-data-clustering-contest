      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T03:04:15+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 03:04</time> by <a rel="author">AFP</a></address>
      <p>MADRID: Karen Khachanov and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Andrey-Rublev">Andrey Rublev</a> helped <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Russia">Russia</a> open the inaugural <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Davis-Cup-Finals">Davis Cup Finals</a> with a 3-0 victory over reigning champions <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Croatia">Croatia</a> in Madrid on Monday.</p>
      <p>World number 17 Khachanov clinched the point for Russia by fighting back to beat Croatian number one Borna Coric 6-7 (4/7), 6-4, 6-4, after Rublev had earlier seen off Borna Gojo 6-3, 6-3.</p>
      <p>"When you're playing not only for yourself, but for your country, you have to fight harder," said Khachanov.</p>
      <p>Russia, who are without US Open runner-up Daniil Medvedev due to exhaustion, can wrap up a place in the quarter-finals with victory over Rafael Nadal's Spain in their second Group B tie on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The 18 nations have been split into six groups of three at the Caja Magica, with the pool winners and two best runners-up to play in the last eight of the first edition of the revamped tournament.</p>
      <p>The teams face off in two best-of-three-set singles matches and one doubles rubber in each tie.</p>
      <p>Khachanov and Rublev completed the clean sweep later on Monday with a 7-6 (7/3), 6-4 doubles win over Ivan Dodig and Nikola Mektic.</p>
      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Canada">Canada</a> claimed a 2-1 victory over well-fancied <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Italy">Italy</a> to strike first in Group F.</p>
      <p>World number 12 Fabio Fognini slumped to a 7-6 (7/5), 7-5 defeat by Vasek Pospisil, ranked 150th, before rising star Denis Shapovalov edged out Matteo Berrettini 7-6 (7/5), 6-7 (3/7), 7-6 (7/5).</p>
      <p>"I'm really happy to get the win against a player like Matteo who has had such a good season," said Shapovalov.</p>
      <p>"I always love representing my country... It's not often you get to play as a team, so it's amazing."</p>
      <p>Italy, who won their only <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Davis-Cup">Davis Cup</a> title in 1976, were the favourites in Group F with Fognini and Berrettini both having enjoyed excellent seasons.</p>
      <p>The 20-year-old Shapovalov saved three set points before snatching the first set in a tie-break, only for Berrettini to level the match in a second-set breaker.</p>
      <p>A clash without a single break of serve, was decided by another tie-break, with Shapovalov reeling off the last three points to win after two hours and 52 minutes on court.</p>
      <p>Berrettini and Fognini boosted Italy's hopes of making the quarters with a hard-fought doubles success over Shapovalov and Pospisil, winning 6-2, 3-6, 6-3.</p>
      <p>Canada take on the United States on Tuesday, with Italy facing the Americans the following day.</p>
      <p>Belgium made a victorious start in Group D with back-to-back singles wins against Colombia.</p>
      <p>The South Americans are playing at the top level of Davis Cup <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/tennis">tennis</a> for the first time, having never played in the old World Group.</p>
      <p>Steve Darcis saw off Santiago Giraldo 6-3, 6-2, before world number 11 David Goffin had to battle back from a set down to avoid a shock against 194th-ranked Daniel Elahi Galan Riveros, winning 3-6, 6-3, 6-3.</p>
      <p>But the world number one doubles pairing of Juan Sebastian Cabal and Robert Farah grabbed a historic win for Colombia by battling past Sander Gille and Joran Vliegen 6-7 (5/7), 6-4, 7-6 (7/3).</p>
