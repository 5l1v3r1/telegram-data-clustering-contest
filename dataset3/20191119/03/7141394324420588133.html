      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T03:56:42+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 03:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://dailyhodl.com/author/thedailyhodl/" target="_blank">Daily Hodl Staff</a></address>
      <p>An index tracking trepidation among crypto traders indicates Bitcoin may have more room to fall.</p>
      <p>The Fear &amp; Greed Index from <a href="https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/">Alternative.me</a> measures market volatility, social media and surveys to determine the overall sentiment among crypto traders.</p>
      <p>The index is now firmly in the fear zone at 38, indicating that investors are worried the price may drop further.</p>

      <p>Run by the developers and creators of Strawpoll.com and Thundercheck.org, the index shows that when traders are fearful, a market correction is typically ongoing.</p>
      <p>The needle is designed to shift into “extreme fear” when a significant correction has taken place, indicating that investors are overly worried and that a buying opportunity could be at hand.</p>
      <p>As for the altcoin market, crypto analyst and winner of CME Group’s annual trading competition in 2016 says he thinks it may have hit a bottom.</p>
      <p>In his latest <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoChoe/status/1195196565662519296">tweet</a>, Eric Choe says Litecoin’s chart is a reflection of the altcoin market at large. He thinks LTC may hit a floor around $55 before the start of a rebound.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“This could honestly be the bottom of the alt-market end of 2019. A lot of charts look like this. Hold the floor!”</i>
