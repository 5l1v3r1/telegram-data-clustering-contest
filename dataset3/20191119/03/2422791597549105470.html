      <h1>Woman yelling at cat meme: His name is Smudge, he's from Ottawa and he hates salad</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T03:49:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 03:49</time> by <a rel="author">Jonathan Forani, CTVNews.ca Writer</a></address>
      <p>Smudge the cat usually sits at the dinner table with his owners.</p>
      <p>But one occasion turned a typical dinner into an origin story.</p>
      <p>“He will freak out if he doesn’t have his own chair,” Miranda Stillabower said Monday on CTV News Channel.</p>
      <p>One night in 2018, without a seat, Smudge stole one from a salad-eating guest. Claiming his place at the table, he wasn’t impressed with what was on the plate.</p>
      <p>In the now-famous image, Smudge -- ears tense and mouth ajar -- appears at once confused, revolted and dejected about the greens in front of him.</p>
      <p>“He only eats meat so I would have to say that he’s always hated vegetables,” said Stillabower.</p>
      <p>The image was originally posted to Tumblr <a href="https://deadbeforedeath.tumblr.com/post/175034192749/he-no-like-vegetals">in 2018</a>, but became an internet sensation when a <a href="https://twitter.com/MISSINGEGIRL/status/1123647491025428480">Twitter user in May</a> combined it with a screenshot from a 2011 episode of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills to become the “<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/woman-yelling-at-a-cat">Woman Yelling at a Cat</a>” meme. Both the images of Taylor Armstrong and Smudge were already widely used as reaction memes online, but together they became one of the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/popular/page/3">most popular</a> jokes on the internet.</p>
      <p>The Instagram account for Smudge (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/smudge_lord/">@smudge_lord</a>) has gained more than 1.2 million followers in less than six months and his owners launched a <a href="https://smudge-lord.com/">merchandise website</a>. They’re selling coffee mugs, T-shirts, sweaters, touques, and baseball caps -- all emblazoned with Smudge’s salad face.</p>
      <p>The cat even has some famous friends, including <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B40wntKHqmf/">Snoop Dogg</a>, former NFL linebacker Bruce Davis, who was filmed wearing one of the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4GBKmencBk/">Smudge T-shirts</a>, and wrestler-actor John Cena, who has <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B493OimlFWh/">posted the memes</a> on his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B03CgdOFiGw/">Instagram account</a> on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B1NvDlqlJ7F/">multiple occasions</a>.</p>
      <p>“At first it was just kind of something funny and now everybody across the world knows who he is. It’s just insane really,” said Stillabower.</p>
      <p>While the feline will forever be unaware of his fame, Real Housewives cast member Armstrong <a href="https://twitter.com/TaylorArmstrong/status/1188577100430577664">addressed the attention</a> she’s received in a series of tweets last month. One user asked how she felt about the image’s circulation considering she was emotional in the <a href="https://youtu.be/zJrpdH5OX-U">Real Housewives scene</a> about issues related to <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/story-behind-popular-woman-yelling-212500694.html">domestic violence</a>. “It’s (OK) to laugh at the images that have been created,” she <a href="https://twitter.com/TaylorArmstrong/status/1188579459214897152">wrote on Twitter last month</a>. “(That) is my past and I have moved on and am in a really healthy, happy marriage.”</p>
      <p>Though it all started with salad, Smudge’s owners have tested his reaction to other food. His distaste is apparently not limited to vegetables. Earlier this month, he <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4fxm1nHg5d/">made the same face</a> at a plate of nachos.</p>
