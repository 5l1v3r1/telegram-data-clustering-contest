      <p>HBO released the first trailer for “Avenue 5,” the new space comedy from “Veep” creator Armando Iannucci.</p>
      <p>Set 40 years in the future, “Avenue 5” stars Hugh Laurie as Ryan Clark, the confident and suave captain of a space cruise ship that has luxury amenities like gourmet buffets, a spa, an observation deck and yoga classes. As shown in the trailer, however, things don’t go exactly according to plan.</p>
      <p>Avenue 5’s eight-week journey around Saturn is interrupted when the ship suddenly encounters technical difficulties, and it’s up to Ryan and his crew to calm the disgruntled passengers and find a way to deal with unexpected events onboard – though they may or may not be equipped for the task.</p>
