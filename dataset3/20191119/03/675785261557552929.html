      <h2>Trump's private doctor Sean Conley said his unexpected trip to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center was actually 'routine' and ruled out health issues</h2>

      <p>Donald Trump's health examination on Saturday was "routine" and he was not treated for any urgent issues, his physician has said.</p>
      <p>Trump's unexpected trip to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center triggered questions on social media since it came months before the president's annual physical has been carried out in the past.</p>
      <p>"Despite some of the speculation, the president has not had any chest pain, nor was he evaluated or treated for any urgent or acute issues," U.S. Navy Commander Sean Conley, Trump's doctor, said in a memo released by the White House.</p>
      <p>"Specifically, he did not undergo any specialised cardiac or neurologic evaluations," Conley said.</p>
      <p>It comes as the President is subject of an impeachment hearing over his conduct with the Ukrainian President.</p>
      <p>The exam was a "routine, planned interim checkup as part of the regular, primary preventative care he receives throughout the year", Conley said.</p>

      <p>"Due to scheduling uncertainties, the trip was kept off the record."</p>
      <p>He said Trump's total cholesterol is now 165, with an HDL of 70, and LDL of 84 and a non-HDL of 95, all of which are considered healthy levels, according to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.</p>
      <p>"Everything very good (great!)," Trump said in a tweet on Sunday about the results. "Will complete next year."</p>
      <p>Earlier in the year Trump was classed in the "obese range' after piling on the pounds during his presidency.</p>

      <p>However the 72-year-old remains in "very good health overall," according to the results of his annual physical examination conducted in February.</p>
      <p>"After taking into account all the laboratory results, examinations and specialist recommendations, it is my determination that the president remains in very good health overall," the president's physician, Sean Conley, wrote in a memo on Thursday.</p>
      <p>A copy of the memo was released by the White House.</p>
      <p>The memo, which detailed the findings of an examination of Trump that Conley led on Friday, said the 72-year-old president weighed 243 pounds (110.2 kg), up from 239 pounds (108.4 kg) in early 2018.</p>
