      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T03:48:27+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 03:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.soyacincau.com/author/alexwnl/" target="_blank">Alexander Wong</a></address>
      <p>The Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (<a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/tag/mcmc/">MCMC</a>) with the cooperation from the Royal Malaysian Police have confiscated a total of 58 uncertified communications equipment through several raids at 12 locations. The raids were conducted at Kuala Lumpur, Kedah, Perak and Pulau Pinang between July to early October 2019.</p>
      <p>According to the press statement, the seized equipment includes antennas, signal booster, repeaters, wireless TV transmitters and AV broadcasting devices, Android TV boxes, walkie-talkies and RF repeater. All communications equipment were confiscated by the Royal Malaysian Police before it was handed over to MCMC for further analysis to assist in investigations.</p>
      <p>The cases will be investigated under Rule 16, Communications and Multimedia (Technical Standards) Regulations 2000 which carries a maximum fine of RM100,000 or imprisonment for up to six months, or both, if found guilty. MCMC is taking stern action on the ownership and sale of non-compliant communications equipment and the commission has handled 19 cases which include 66 charges between January to September 2019.</p>
      <p>The total penalty issued during the period amounts to RM432,000, which is almost 8x the total penalties issued in 2018 amounting to RM55,000. Last year, there were a total of 10 cases involving 15 charges that were brought to court.</p>
