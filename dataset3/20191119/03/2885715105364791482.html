      <h1>Severely malnourished, devoid of standard education: Children of Saketri slum recoup with efforts of SEWA volunteers</h1>

      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T03:05:19+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 03:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/chahat-rana/" target="_blank">Chahat Rana</a></address>
      <p>For the children of Saketri Slum in Panchkula, education is not a right but a privilege, and so are basic health amenities.</p>
      <p>“When we first came here, there were 13 severely malnourished children in this basti. So malnourished that the World Health Organisation does not have a scale low enough to categorise these children, hence, we came up with our own,” said Harsharan Kaur, an employee of the Ahmedabad-based trade union Self Employed Women’s Association (SEWA).</p>
      <p>Since the last two years, members of SEWA along with volunteers from the Rotary Club of <a href="https://indianexpress.com/elections/chandigarh-lok-sabha-election-results/">Chandigarh</a> have been working with families in the slum to ensure rights and availability of basic amenities for them.</p>
      <p>The basti, which has been divided into five zones or clusters, is home to about 560 families of daily wage labourers from different parts of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.</p>
      <p>According to a survey done by SEWA, there are around 200 children of all age groups living in the basti, out of which 68 are below five years of age. “We focus especially on the health of the young children and pregnant mothers who are prone to becoming malnourished and anaemic,” said Dr Seema Gupta, a volunteer from Rotary Club.</p>
      <p>The volunteers have trained two members of the slum to be community mobilisers, who work in the capacity of ASHA workers; weighing newborn children and dispensing knowledge of medical practices and hygiene.</p>
      <p>“ASHA workers gave up on our people long ago. They think they cannot help us. So we help ourselves now by trying to liaison with ASHA workers,” said a middle-aged woman from the slum, who now works as a community mobiliser, and is regularly trained by SEWA to ensure that she is qualified to provide adequate services to the residents of her slum.</p>
      <p>In a small office rented by the SEWA employees opposite the slum, medicines line up a cabinet built into its wall. Dr Shreekant, an ex-chief of National Health Mission, Punjab, visits every Thursday to provide medical consultation to the slum dwellers.</p>
      <p>“The government dispensary, located close-by, barely has any medicines and is badly maintained. Further, a doctor is meant to visit the dispensary at least twice a week and that never happens. They just have a barely qualified auxiliary nurse midwife who tries her best,” said Kaur wryly.</p>
      <p>Apart from providing after school tuitions to the slum children and older girls who dropped out of school to help out their impoverished parents, the organisation also tutors adults who wish to perform small tasks such as reading numbers on a bus or comprehending time.</p>
      <p>“The standard of education is so bad that we have to strengthen each and every students’ basic understanding of their subjects before we even beginning to teach them their syllabus,” said Mukesh, one of the teachers employed by the organisation to run the afternoon classes.</p>
      <p>The Right to Education Act mandates that every child between the age of 6 to 14 be given free and compulsory education. “How do you expect these children to complete their education when they have no stability in their lives?” asked Ramratti, the community mobiliser trained by SEWA. According to Ramvatti, the slum has been demolished by the Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) at least 20 times since 2010.</p>
      <p>Kaur alleged that HUDA hopes to remove the slum dwellers without providing adequate rehabilitation. “As many as 55 of these families have already received a receipt under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) and have been waiting to be granted a house under the scheme. They had all the required documents to show for it, yet nothing has been done,” informed Simranjit, a SEWA employee who works closely with the slum. He said that officials from the PMAY visit the area at least six times a year, but no houses have been allocated yet.</p>
      <p>“For now, every time their houses are razed, they lose all their belongings and documents. Then they start over again, applying for schemes and identity cards and such,” he added.</p>
      <p>Pointing towards a young girl playing outside her house, Kaur explained that the girl, Shivani, is one of the 13 children who was severely malnourished before SEWA began their work there. Shivani, aged six, looks barely two-year-old. Her malnourishment has stunted her growth to the extent of making it impossible for her to attend school.</p>
      <p>“She is much better now, but her future is lost,” added Kaur.  Hope continues to be the driving force for these workers and the children of the basti.</p>
