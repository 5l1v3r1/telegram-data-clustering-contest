      <p>I’m back in Japan for the first time in a while and I’ve been looking forward to catching up with a whole bunch of old friends.</p>
      <p>While I’m in Tokyo, I’m staying with a 親友(<i>shin’yū</i>, close friend/bestie), and catching up with another 親友 if she can get the time off work. In fact, most of my time here will be spent catching up with 友達 (<i>tomodachi</i>, friends) and 仲間 (<i>nakama</i>, companions) from when I used to live here.</p>
      <p>My first reunion has been put together by a 親友 named Masa. I meet up with him at Asakusa Station and am greeted with a big “久しぶり!” (<i>“Hisashiburi!</i>” “Long time no see!”) upon arrival. I ask Masa who he has been able to dig up from my past stint in Japan for our impromptu 飲み会 (<i>nomikai</i>, drinking party) and he mentions one person, Mayumi, whom I haven’t seen in a decade.</p>
      <p>10年ぶりに会ってないなぁ。あっという間だなぁ (<i>Jūnen buri ni attenai nā. Atto iu ma da nā</i>, I haven’t met [her] in 10 years. Time flies), I think to myself.</p>
      <p>We get to the tempura place we’re having our 飲み会 and are soon met by Masahisa and Yasuko, 仲間 who worked at the same ライブハウス (<i>raibu hausu</i>, live-music venue) that I used to frequent in the 2000s. I know them through a guy named Taka, who was a 登山仲間 (<i>tozan nakama,</i> hiking buddy) of mine a while back.</p>
      <p>Mayumi arrives and is followed by Kaoru, who rolls in from Nagano Prefecture.</p>
      <p>“薫ちゃん、長野からわざわざありがとう!” (“<i>Kaoru-chan, Nagano kara waza-waza arigatō</i>!” “Kaoru, thanks for coming all the way from Nagano!”) I say to her with a big hug. “いいえ、とんでもない” (“<i>Iie, tondemonai</i>, No worries), she replies. Kaoru is Yasuko’s 相棒 (<i>aibō</i>, partner in crime) from their time working at the ライブハウス.</p>
      <p>Given the place of independent musicians in Japanese society, these 友達関係 (<i>tomodachi kankei</i>, peer relationships) help provide an 居場所 (<i>ibasho</i>, place to belong or a sense of acceptance) when you feel a bit like a misfit. And with this group, 本当に居場所がある (<i>hontō ni ibasho ga aru</i>, I honestly have a place to belong). As the saying goes, 類は友を呼ぶ (<i>rui wa tomo o yobu</i>, birds of a feather flock together).</p>
      <p>When I first met this group of friends, I was doing some translation work for a few of them. My job was to make the English lyrics of their bands’ songs sound as natural as possible. And, of course, その時こそ (<i>sono toki koso</i>, especially then) our interactions were a lot more formal. There were lots of greetings ending in bows and a “よろしくお願いします” (“<i>Yoroshiku o-negai shimasu</i>,” “I’m looking forward to working with you”). This would be met with a response of “こちらこそ よろしくお願いします,” (“<i>Kochira koso yoroshiku o-negai shimasu</i>,” “It’s my pleasure, I’m looking forward to working with you”).</p>
      <p>こそ is a particle that can emphasize what you’re saying, as in, 今年こそこの試験に通ってやる (<i>Kotoshi koso kono shiken ni tōtte-yaru</i>, I will pass the exam for sure this year). In that case, you’re conveying to the listener that it’s <i>this year</i> that you will pass the exam.</p>
      <p>You will hear こそ a lot with こちら (<i>kochira</i>), which means “in this direction” but is also a polite way of saying “this.” The term こちらこそ therefore emphasizes “this side’s” (your own) sincerity, for example:</p>
      <p>A: どうもすみませんでした (<i>Dōmo sumimasen deshita</i>, I’m very sorry).</p>
      <p>B: いいえ、こちらこそすみませんでした (<i>Iie, kochira koso sumimasen deshita</i>, No, it’s me who’s very sorry).</p>
      <p>After working together for a few years the formality of these greetings has been scaled back to a more casual “よろしく！” (“<i>Yoroshiku!</i>” “Thanks in advance!”) and “こちらこそ！” (“<i>Kochira koso!</i>” “Thanks to you, too”). Nowadays, however, we’re extremely casual. In the cramped yakitori joint, I trip over a chair and hear Masa yell out, “サム、酔っ払い！” (“<i>Samu, yopparai</i>!” “Sam, you’re drunk!). Pointing at his own bright red face, I reply, “君こそ！” (“<i>Kimi koso!</i>” “You are!”).</p>
      <p>When こそ follows the particle から (because), it emphasizes the reason: 久しぶりに会ったからこそ、びっくりするほど心地良かった (<i>Hisashiburi ni atta kara koso, bikkuri suru hodo kokochi yokatta</i>, Precisely because it had been so long since I’d seen [my friends], I was especially surprised at how comfortable being with them was). こういう友達がいるからこそ、日本に来るのは楽しい (<i>Kō iu tomodachi ga iru kara koso, Nihon ni kuru no wa tanoshii</i>, It’s because I have these kinds of friends, coming to Japan is fun.)</p>
      <p>With the party winding down we were still trying to figure out where one band’s 元スタッフ (<i>moto-sutaffu</i>, former roadie) ended up in life. Hopefully, 今度こそ会いましょう (<i>kondo-koso aimashō</i>, we can meet up with them next time).</p>
