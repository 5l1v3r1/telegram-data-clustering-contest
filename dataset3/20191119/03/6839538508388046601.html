      <p>A woman who burnt down her cheating partner’s rental home, killing a pet cat and dog inside, has been jailed for two years.</p>
      <p>Mother-of-four Veasha Foley had already drunk 20 to 30 beers on the morning of November 9 last year before she arrived at the Leonora property to find her partner having sex with another woman on a mattress on the front porch.</p>
      <p>Foley, 30, told a psychiatrist the woman ran off and the pair argued before she called out to check if anyone was in the house and then set a blanket on top of the mattress on fire.</p>
      <p>“It was particularly hurtful to her because Ms Foley and her daughter used to sleep on that mattress,” defence counsel Tanja Cobden told the District Court of WA, sitting in Kalgoorlie.</p>
      <p>She felt it was extremely disrespectful to the memory of her daughter, who died months earlier, and didn’t mean to burn down the house, the court heard.</p>
      <p>Ms Cobden said her client didn’t know the pets were inside and was very sad that they died.</p>
