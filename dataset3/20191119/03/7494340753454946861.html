      <h1>Antivirus Vendors and Non-Profits Join To Form 'Coalition Against Stalkerware'</h1>

      <p>Ten organizations today announced the creation of the Coalition Against Stalkerware, the first global initiative of its kind, <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/antivirus-vendors-and-non-profits-join-to-form-coalition-against-stalkerware/">with the sole purpose of fighting against stalkerware</a>. From a report:<i> Also known as spouseware, stalkerware is a smaller category of the spyware class. Stalkerware refers to apps that abusive partners install on the devices of their loved ones without their knowledge or consent. They contain features that allow the abuser to track their significant other's geographical location, web browsing habits, social media activity, log keystrokes inside instant messaging apps, retrieve photos, or even record audio and video without the owner's knowledge. Stalkerware apps are available for both mobile and desktop operating systems and are often sold commercially under the guise of child trackers, pet trackers, phone-finding apps, remote access toolkits, and so on. This kind of apps live in a gray area of the current app ecosystem where they can be used for both legitimate and criminal purposes, giving app makers an easy excuse when confronted with abuse reports from victims -- albeit some apps are more blatant and advertise themselves as a way to catch cheating girlfriends, although, these cases are rare.</i></p>
