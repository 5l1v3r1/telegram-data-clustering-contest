      <h1>Ohi Lands $2.75M To Enable Quick Delivery For Smaller Brands</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T03:20:02+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 03:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pymnts.com/author/pymnts/" target="_blank">PYMNTS</a></address>
      <p><a href="http://www.shipohi.com/">Ohi</a>, an eCommerce startup, announced that it has closed a $2.75 million Seed funding round led by Flybridge Capital Partners.</p>
      <p>Founded last year by CEO Ben Jones, Ohi offers same-day or next-day delivery to smaller brands via micro-warehouses in major cities. Gig workers pick and pack at warehouses, while partners Postmates and DoorDash help carry out last-mile courier services. Ohi charges brands a fixed monthly fee to use the platform, starting at $750 per month, while more expensive tiers provide access to more features, such as matching inventory to warehouse locations and access to more spaces. Ohi also charges $2.50 for a pick-and-pack fee.</p>
      <p>Jones told <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/18/ohi-raises-2-75m-to-power-same-day-delivery-for-brands-that-arent-amazon/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+techcrunch%2Fstartups+%28TechCrunch+%C2%BB+Startups%29">reports</a> that delivery is a higher cost for brands than storage, and that Ohi is aiming to compete with eCommerce giant <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> by offering lower prices on same-day and next-day delivery through its network of commercial space, pick-and-pack and courier services. Last June, Amazon <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/amazon-delivery/2019/amazon-one-day-shipping-no-minimum-purchase/">announced</a> that it was expanding its one-day delivery with Amazon Prime, opening it up to members with no minimum purchase amount, and adding more than 10 million products.</p>
      <p>However, there’s another benefit to those that use Ohi’s platform: The eCommerce startup says its brands are seeing a decrease in cart abandonment when customers see the same-day or next-day delivery option.</p>
      <p>“There is a lot of positive momentum behind what we’re doing,” said Jones. “Every brand we talk to knows this is the future.”</p>
      <p>Ohi currently offers its service in New York’s Manhattan and Brooklyn, and is launching in Los Angeles this week.</p>
      <p>“The greatest challenge we face is how to scale quickly without making mistakes,” said Jones. “It’s not quite as simple as a piece of software that has one-to-many distribution. We’re actually holding brands’ inventory, and there’s a physical aspect to this business that makes it more complex. Making sure we can scale that efficiently without making mistakes is going to be one of the biggest challenges.”</p>
