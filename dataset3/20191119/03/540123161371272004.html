      <h1>GENESIS 12:3</h1>

      <blockquote>I will bless those who bless you And curse him that curses you; And all the families of the earth Shall bless themselves by you.”<cite><a href="http://theisraelbible.com/bible/genesis/chapter-12/#verse-3">GENESIS 12:3 (The Israel Bible™)</a></cite></blockquote>
      <p>Avraham is commanded to travel to a land unknown to him. To assuage his fears that he would not find friends or supporters in his new home, Hashem promises that He will remain on Avraham’s side by blessing those who bless him and cursing those who curse him. He concludes with the promise that Avraham and his descendants will become a source of blessing to the entire world. This promise has remained in effect through the generations. History has shown that whenever a nation persecutes the Jewish people, curses ultimately befall it. However, wherever the Children of Israel have been welcomed, they have made immeasurable contributions to society, thus earning divine favor for their host nation. On an individual level as well, many non-Jews look to this verse as an important reason to stand with the People of Israel and the Land of Israel.</p>
