      <p>Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) has just one more pay-per-view (PPV) on the docket for 2019, and it’s going to be a big one. UFC 245 is set to go down from inside T-Mobile Arena on Dec. 14, 2019 in Las Vegas, Nevada featuring a trio of title fights.</p>
      <p>In the main event, Welterweight champion, Kamaru Usman, will defend his belt against former interim title holder, Colby Covington. It’s a fight years in the making, as the two men have some very bad blood that needs to be settled once and for all.</p>
      <p>In the co-headlining act, Featherweight champion, Max Holloway, will put his belt on the line against Alexander Volkanovski, while women’s champ-champ, Amanda Nunes, defends her Bantamweight title against Germaine de Randamie.</p>
      <p>But the action doesn’t end there...not by a long shot.</p>
      <p>Rounding out the main card are a couple of intriguing Bantamweight showdowns as former 145-pound champion, Jose Aldo, makes his debut in the division against former title contender, Marlon Moraes. Also, Urijah Faber will face off against Petr Yan in what is sure-to-be a highly-competitive affair.</p>
      <p>The promotion has unveiled its first promotional trailer hyping up the event, which can be streamed exclusively on <a href="http://go.web.plus.espn.com/c/482924/595608/9070?sharedid=MMAMania">ESPN+.</a></p>
