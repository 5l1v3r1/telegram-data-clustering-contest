      <h1>Injury Update For Kansas City Chiefs RB Damien Williams</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T03:17:11+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 03:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>If you’re a fantasy football player who needed a big performance out of Kansas City Chiefs running back Damien Williams, you’re probably not very happy right now.</p>
      <p>Williams went down late in the first half of tonight’s game against the Los Angeles Chargers when he took a big hit on a running play. Williams stayed down on the ground for a while.</p>
      <p>It looked like the veteran running back injured his chest. Sure enough, Kansas City announced Williams is dealing with a rib injury.</p>
      <p>He is officially questionable to return.</p>

      <p>With Williams out of commission, LeSean McCoy and Darrell Williams have carried the load to start the second half. Each player has a touchdown in the game.</p>
      <p>Currently, the Chiefs lead the Chargers 17-9 in the third quarter after Darrell Williams scored on a goal-line run.</p>
      <p>You can watch the action on ESPN.</p>
