      <h1>Former Elpida CEO joins China state-owned chipmaker</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T03:17:10+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 03:17</time> by <a rel="author">Lena Li, Shanghai; Jessie Shen, DIGITIMES</a></address>
      <p>Tsinghua Unigroup has announced the appointment of Yukio Sakamoto, the former CEO for Japan's Elpida Memory, as senior VP of Unigroup and head of the group's Japan-based unit.</p>
      <p>"We are thrilled to welcome Yukio Sakamoto to the Unigroup family," said Zhao Weiguo, chairman and CEO of Unigroup, in a statement. "Attracting top talent has been a key to Unigroup's rapid and innovation-driven growth."</p>
      <p>Sakamoto has accumulated over 30 years of experience in the semiconductor and DRAM fields. Sakamoto resigned as CEO and president of Elpida when Micron Technology completed the acquisition of the Japan-based DRAM maker in 2013.</p>
      <p>Speculation started circulating in 2017 that Charles Kau was in touch with Sakamoto. Kau joined Tsinghua Unigroup in 2015, and has become a key figure assisting the state-backed technology conglomerate in growing its memory business.</p>
      <p>Kau, a veteran from Taiwan's DRAM industry, earlier in 2019 was appointed as CEO for Tsinghua Unigroup's DRAM business group. Kau already assisted Yangtze Memory Technologies (YMTC), a unit of Tsinghua Unigroup, in becoming China's first homegrown NAND flash chipmaker.</p>
      <p>"Sakamoto's appointment is not only a testament to our strategy of growing locally while expanding globally, but will also undoubtedly boost our capacity for innovation," Zhao continued. "We encourage Unigroup subsidiaries around the world to take advantage of local talent in order to serve regional customers better and contribute to local market development."</p>
      <p>Also in the statement issued by Unigroup, Sakamoto stated, "I am eager to leverage my expertise to help implement Unigroup's growth strategy, expand the business into the Japanese market and boost its global development."</p>
