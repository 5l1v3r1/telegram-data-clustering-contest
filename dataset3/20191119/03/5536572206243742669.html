      <p>A person connected to the New England Patriots is accusing another team of cheating. I know, right!</p>
      <p>New England color analyst Scott Zolak accused the Philadelphia Eagles of pumping in crowd noise during Sunday game, citing a spike in volume on the very first series the Patriots had the ball.</p>

      <p>Zolak is the only person to make the claim thus far, although New England Patriots QB Tom Brady was asked about it in his weekly interview on WEEI’s “The Greg Hill Show” by saying: Good job, Zo! I like it.”</p>
      <p>The last time a team got caught pumping in crowd noise was the Atlanta Falcons in 2016 that got them fined and docked a 2016 fifth-round draft pick.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t notice, but again, those are not the things I would notice. Loud is loud,” Brady said, via <a href="https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/patriots/did-eagles-pump-crowd-noise-vs-patriots-tom-brady-didnt-notice">NBC Sports Boston</a>. “At one point when you can’t hear, basically it’s like ‘loud’ and then ‘louder,’ but you’re really not going to notice the difference much.”</p>
