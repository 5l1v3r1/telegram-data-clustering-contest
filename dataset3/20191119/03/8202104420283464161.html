      <h1>Saskatchewan winter forecast: 'Bitter cold' expected in 2020, says Weather Network</h1>

      <p>The trend of a deep freeze will continue through Saskatchewan and Manitoba, especially in the southern parts of the Prairies, where meteorologist Chris Scott expects cold air to anchor down for the season.</p>

      <h3>Saskatchewanians should enjoy the warm temperatures blanketing the province while they can, says a Weather Network meteorologist.</h3>
      <p>Once the calendar turns, just like 2019 these balmy days will be a thing of the past.</p>
      <p>“Gonna be cold,” meteorologist Brad Rousseau said Monday, when Saskatoon reached 6 C and Regina hit 7 C.</p>
      <p>Much of Canada is set to experience a long, chilly, messy winter, according to the seasonal forecast released by the Weather Network. Saskatoon, Regina and the rest of Saskatchewan are “in the same boat,” Rousseau said.</p>
      <p>“You’re going down together.”</p>

      <p>Shots of cold will be balanced with warm Pacific air through much of December, Rousseau predicted. In January and February, “bitter cold … will lock firmly into place,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It does look like spring will be a little delayed this year.”</p>
      <p>He expects the cold pattern in Saskatchewan will be “quite stubborn” and similar to last winter in terms of length, though he is “not expecting to see that calibre of cold … I hope not, for your guys’ sake,” he said.</p>
      <p>Last <a href="https://thestarphoenix.com/news/local-news/by-the-numbers-farewell-february-milder-march-expected-in-saskatoon">February in Saskatoon, for instance, the average daily high was -18.7C (well below the historical average of -6.3C) and the average daily low was -29.7C</a> (twice as cold as the historical average low of -15.7C). It was the fourth-coldest February on record, dating back 123 years.</p>
      <p>Meteorologist Doug Gillham said the seasonal prediction tries to answer questions of “how will the season be remembered?” He compared the Weather Network’s forecast to pre-season hockey predictions, noting day-to-day weather is anyone’s guess beyond the seven-day forecast.</p>
      <p>“It would be foolish to sit down and predict which games the Calgary Flames will win or lose through the course of a season, but often you have a good handle based on who’s coming back, maybe who you traded for,” Gillham said.</p>

      <p>“Is this the year that you contend for the Stanley Cup, is this the year where you’re just fighting for the playoffs, or is this the year where you think you’re going to get a really good draft pick because you’re contending for the basement?”</p>
      <p>In Alberta, Weather Network chief meteorologist Chris Scott said, above-normal precipitation can be expected in the south, with especially frigid temperatures throughout the province. Things are looking a little better in British Columbia, where Scott said temperatures will be slightly above normal and precipitation will be just below normal.</p>
      <p>From southern Ontario to southern Quebec, Scott said, people can prepare for a winter that’s colder than usual and has much more precipitation than normal.</p>
      <p>There will likely be lots of snow in New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, Scott said, while in Nova Scotia it will be a mix of snow, ice and rain. In Newfoundland and Labrador, Scott said, snowfall will be average.</p>
      <p>Scott said Nunavut and the Northwest Territories will likely experience average winter conditions, which bucks a recent trend of warmer-than-usual winters in the Far North. In Yukon, however, the winter will likely be warmer than normal, Scott added.</p>
