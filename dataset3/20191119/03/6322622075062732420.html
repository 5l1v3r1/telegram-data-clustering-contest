      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 19): The Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition has no intention to interfere with matters related to leadership in the Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition, according to former prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak [BN-Pekan].</p>
      <p>Najib, who is also BN's advisory board chairman, said he was not aware of a "dinner meeting" reportedly held last night at the residence of PKR deputy president Datuk Seri Mohamed Azmin Ali [PH-Gombak] with two dozen BN members of Parliament, including former defence minister Datuk Seri Hishammuddin Hussein [BN-Sembrong].</p>
      <p>"I only learnt about it in media reports, I will have to talk to the BN MPs who (reportedly) attended (the meeting) to know whether it is true. I was not invited, and I don't want to be invited," Najib told reporters during a short break in his trial on the alleged tampering of 1MDB audit report.</p>
      <p>He was asked whether BN is being divided into two factions, with one supporting PKR president Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim [PH-Port Dickson] to succeed as the new Prime Minister, while the other backing Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad [PH-Langkawi] to stay on.</p>
      <p>"That is PH's problem in leadership. BN's focus now is to be a constructive opposition, and to champion the interest of the Rakyat (people). We are not involved in their (PH) leadership matters," Najib said.</p>
      <p>Several local internet news portals reported yesterday that the meeting was to stop a political attempt to accelerate Dr Mahathir's resignation and make way for Anwar.</p>
