      <h1>Hong Kong university standoff extends, passenger trains temporarily suspended</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T03:17:12+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 03:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/dhwani-mehta" target="_blank">Dhwani Mehta</a></address>
      <p>Amid ongoing Hong Kong unrest, as the University stand-off extends into a third day on Tuesday, the Global Times is out with the latest update, citing that some passenger trains between mainland china and Hong Kong temporarily suspended on Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Chinese state news agency, Xinhua, reported that a new police chief was appointed in Hong Kong. About 200 protesters still remain trapped in the Hong Kong Polytechnic University campus, raising fears of bloody clashes.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam told police she hopes campus standoff can be solved peacefully. She also told the police to handle protesters leaving campus in a humane way.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong’s social unrest has disrupted the city for more than five months, with no resolution in sight in the near-term.</p>
      <p>Despite the civil unrest, the Chinese stocks are trading in the green alongside Hong Kong’s Hang Seng, as the Chinese stimulus hopes continue to play out amid renewed US-China trade pessimism. USD/JPY’s latest leg up seems to have fizzled, as it holds the lower ground near 108.60 amid neutral S&amp;P 500 futures.</p>
