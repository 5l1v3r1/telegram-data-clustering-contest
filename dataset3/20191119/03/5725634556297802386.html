        <b>Introduction</b>
      </p>
      <p>Traditionally, most of my analysis on Seeking Alpha has focused on how to avoid losses and how to profit from the price cycles of classic cyclical stocks. There is another group of stocks, however, whose stock prices and earnings fluctuate far less than the classic cyclical stocks I have traditionally written about. While these stocks aren't as cyclical as a "classic cyclical," they can still be subject to large swings in sentiment and can go through what I call "sentiment cycles." Recently, I have been adopting some of the techniques I've used with classic cyclicals and applying them to sentiment-driven cyclicals. Today's stock, Target (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TGT">TGT</a>) is one of those. As part of the analysis, I calculate what I consider to be the two main drivers of future total returns: Market Sentiment returns and Business/Shareholder returns. I then combine the CAGR estimates from Market Sentiment and Business/Shareholder returns to get an expected 10-year, full-cycle CAGR estimate. Currently, I consider an expected 10-year CAGR &gt; 12% a "Buy," 4-12% a "Hold" and &lt; 4% a "Sell."</p>
      <p>With that, let's get into the analysis.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How Cyclical Are Earnings?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Since I use different approaches for analyzing a stock based on how cyclical earnings are, historical earnings cyclicality is the first thing I examine. Let's take a look at Target's historical earnings using a F.A.S.T. Graph to examine that cyclicality:</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/11/17/17186012-1574006499947142.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>I break down earnings cyclicality into five basic categories. The first category I call "secular growth." This category describes earnings that continue to rise every year, even during economic recessions. The next three categories are "low," "moderate" and "deep." "Low" is usually for businesses which have earnings that have a history of declining in the single digits percentage-wise during downturns, but not much further than that. "Deep" I consider earnings that fall more than -50%, and "moderate" somewhere in between low and deep. And last but not least are businesses whose earnings go negative during cyclical downturns but recover soon after that, which I call "highly cyclical." For businesses that have earnings in the deep or highly cyclical categories, I use an entirely different type of analysis, so it's important to determine at the outset which category a stock falls into.</p>
      <p>Target grew earnings through the 2001 recession right up until the Great Recession started in 2008. Since 2008, though, earnings have been more volatile, experiencing declines of -14%, -27%, and -6% this cycle. Up until this cycle, Target had been a multi-decade secular growth story, but when we see big earnings declines of -27% as we saw in 2013, which was not a recession year, that is a sign that Target has likely ended its secular growth phase. It's no secret that competitors like Amazon (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AMZN">AMZN</a>) have taken some of the steam out of Target's business. That doesn't mean that Target couldn't still be a good value if it was trading at the right price, but I think it's important to point out that pre-2008 Target trends don't have a whole lot of bearing on the current cycle since 2007. Given what we've seen this cycle, on a scale of 1-8 I would rate Target's earnings cyclicality a '3'.</p>
      <p>For stocks ranked a "3," their price cycles can usually be explained by a mixture of earnings fluctuations and market sentiment. In Target's case, it is appropriate to use a 10-year, full-cycle analysis (which focuses on earnings and sentiment) rather than the shorter-term, price-cycle-based analysis (which focuses mostly on historical price cyclicality). So, using a 10-year, full-cycle analysis is what I will perform since it can capture moderate earnings swings like Target's fairly well.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Market Sentiment Returns</b>
      </p>
      <p>In order to estimate what sort of returns we might expect over the next 10 years, let's begin by examining what return I could expect 10 years from now if the P/E multiple were to revert to its mean from the previous economic cycle. I start the previous cycle around 2007, about a year before the last recession.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/11/17/17186012-15740065738304682.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Target's current blended P/E is 18.83, while its normal P/E this past cycle has been 14.99. If over the course of the next 10 years, the P/E were to revert to 14.99 and everything else was held equal, it would produce a 10-year CAGR of about <b>-2.25%</b>.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Business/Shareholder Yield</b>
      </p>
      <p>There are four components to the business/shareholder yield: the dividend yield, the expected buyback yield, the portion of the earnings yield that the business keeps to reinvest itself, and the full-cycle earnings growth rate. Ultimately, the business/shareholder yield is going to be limited by the earnings yield, so let's take a look at that.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/11/18/saupload_ccdfbbd52f8d49ec921acc00687332be.png"/>
        <figcaption>Data by <a href="http://ycharts.com/">YCharts</a></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Target's forward earnings yield is currently +5.47%.</p>
      <p>Since I'm using historical EPS estimates from F.A.S.T. Graphs for many of my calculations, I like to have a way to quickly check to see if a business is taking on debt (or already taken on debt) as a way to prop up those EPS numbers (often through stock buybacks). I like to look at free cash flow to equity/enterprise value yield in order to highlight potential problems. Looking at the longer-term chart typically also will show events like acquisitions, because there will often be a downward spike in the FCFE/EV yield. I tend to avoid stocks that have made bigger acquisitions or mergers and stocks that are borrowing money to buy back shares. So, this is a good, quick check for me to know whether I need to dig deeper or not.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/11/18/saupload_2863cd66492940b5f46f1967708e9629.png"/>
        <figcaption>Data by <a href="http://ycharts.com/">YCharts</a></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>With the FCFE/EV yield coming in at +4.90% as of the end of last quarter, it's pretty close to the earnings yield, so I don't see anything that jumps out at me that warrants any deeper investigation, and I'll just use the more generous earnings yield for my calculations in the article.</p>
      <p>Personally, I don't really care how management chooses to allocate earnings, as long as how earnings are allocated isn't completely irrational. It is perfectly fine for me if a company takes its earnings and reinvests them in the business as long as it can do so successfully. And if the business is no longer growing much, I am satisfied with collecting a large dividend. Or, if the company's shares are cheap, I'm also happy with it buying back stock. Mostly what I care about is what the earnings yield is, and how much I can expect it to grow over the next 10 years so that I can estimate my likely return on the investment over that time frame.</p>
      <p>Currently, 2.33% is coming back in the form of a dividend from Target. Let's see if we can expect something to come back in the form of a stock buyback.</p>
      <p>Examining the buyback history serves two purposes. The first is, much like the dividends, we want to know as investors <i>how</i> our money is being allocated. If the stock price of the business is low, then buybacks are a very efficient way of returning money to shareholders, especially if they are paid for with earnings instead of borrowed money. If the stock price is high, then buybacks are not a wise use of funds, because the returns might be lower than an investor might be able to get if they received a dividend and invested in something else or if the business invested in itself. The worst case is when a business is borrowing money to buy back expensive shares. I usually avoid businesses that are doing this, and I consider the practice a flashing warning sign that management's interests are not aligned with shareholders.</p>
      <p>Second, since I use long-term EPS trends in order to estimate earnings growth, I want to know how much stock was repurchased over the last cycle so that I can back out those stock repurchases when making my earnings growth estimates.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/11/18/saupload_fb40682658f4dc8bd363baf53d6f5f3c.png"/>
        <figcaption>Data by <a href="http://ycharts.com/">YCharts</a></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Target has reduced its shares outstanding by about -40.57% this cycle. This is a fairly large percentage of buybacks over this time period. I'll back these share repurchases out of my EPS growth estimates later on in the analysis.</p>
      <p>Next, I want to check the more recent 3-year and 1-year buyback trends in order to estimate what sort of buyback yield we might expect over the next cycle.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/11/18/saupload_4a3cc7ab8d7120ec5fd9519feb7e4bc5.png"/>

        <figcaption>Data by <a href="http://ycharts.com/">YCharts</a></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Buying at today's prices, we can expect about a 2.09% buyback yield from Target's share repurchases going forward, that's about the same as their dividend yield, so we can expect roughly equal amounts of Target's earnings to paid out in dividends and buybacks, and most their earnings are indeed paid out.</p>
      <p>Since I am interested in how much money Target might be earning over the next 10 years, I also want to take into account any additional earnings from EPS growth that might occur over this time period. I'll estimate that by looking at the previous cycle, in this case, measured from 2007 through 2020, and I'll remove the effects of stock buybacks. When I do the math on that, I get a cyclically adjusted earnings growth rate of +1.32%, which is a pretty low growth rate. Just to make sure this rate estimate seems reasonable and isn't too low, I going to take a quick look at revenue over this time period to see if I might be missing something here.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/11/18/saupload_b591996f17f2d53ddaa728c678962d05.png"/>
        <figcaption>Data by <a href="http://ycharts.com/">YCharts</a></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Revenue since 2007 has only risen about 29%. This seems at least in the ballpark of what we might expect with my earnings growth estimate, so I'm going to stick with it.</p>
      <p>Next, I'll apply that growth rate to current earnings looking forward 10 years in order to get a final 10-year CAGR estimate. The way I think about this is, if I bought Target's whole business for $100, it would pay me back $5.47 per year, and that amount would grow at +1.32% per year for 10 years. I want to know how much money I would have in total at the end of 10 years on my $100 investment, which I calculate to be about $158.76, and that translates to a <b>+4.73%</b> 10-year CAGR.</p>
      <p>
        <b>10-Year, Full-Cycle CAGR Estimate</b>
      </p>
      <p>Potential future returns can come from two main places: market sentiment or business/shareholder returns. If we assume that market sentiment reverts to the mean from the last cycle over the next 10 years, it will produce a -2.25% CAGR. If the business/shareholder yield and growth are similar to the last cycle, the company should produce a +4.73% 10-year CAGR. If we put the two together, we get an expected 10-year, full-cycle CAGR of <b>+2.48%</b>. This is significantly below the 4% threshold I use for a "Sell" rating, so Target is currently a "Sell" for me.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Opportunity Risk/Reward</b>
      </p>
      <p>Since I think Target is a decent business but is simply priced too high, it's worth looking at the odds of the price falling to a level where we could buy it near its average P/E ratio if we sell at today's levels versus what we might miss out on by rotating out of the stock at today's prices.</p>
      <p>The first step of this process is to see during how many years over the past two decades that Target has traded below its average P/E of 14.99, and at some point during each year in 10 out of the past 20 years, you would have had a chance to buy the stock below its average P/E. The most recent year the P/E traded that low was earlier this year. (It's also worth noting the shift from being a 'secular growth' stock that started in 2008. Almost all of the years Target traded above its average PE this cycle are from pre-2008. In the 11 years since 2008, Target has traded below its average PE in 10 of them.) So, it doesn't seem unreasonable to me to think that during the next economic slowdown, or perhaps even before then, Target's P/E will fall at least to that 14.99 level. (During the last recession, the P/E fell below 10.) If the company's P/E contracts from its current multiple of 18.83 to 14.99 while earnings are held steady, the price would drop about -20%.</p>
      <p>In order to estimate the opportunity risk/reward, I use F.A.S.T. Graphs' forecasting tool to estimate future price appreciation, including dividends, for the next 2-3 years using analysts' estimates. What I want to know is, if the stock reverts to the mean in 2-3 years, whether I will have a reasonable chance to buy the stock at a significantly lower price than it trades today or if I would likely never get a chance at a lower price.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/11/17/17186012-1574013783460092.png"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Forecasting out 2-3 years to early-2022, including dividends, we can expect to add $23.09 to Target's current price. That gives us a price estimate 2-3 years from now of $136.30 using today's 18 P/E ratio. If the stock price at that point reverts to its mean, it would lose about -20% of its value and produce a price of $109.04, which is about where the stock trades at today. So, even if we were to go over two years before the stock price reverts to its average P/E ratio and assume the analysts' growth expectations between now and then are correct, we would still probably get a chance to at least get back to even on the stock after trading out of it. If a correction were to start tomorrow, however, we could expect to lose over -20% of today's price. And if we were to have a recession, we could expect Target's price to fall about -50% from today's levels based on past cycles. In order to be a holder of Target stock at these prices, I think an investor needs a strong thesis on how Target is going to improve earnings growth over the long-term. That's really the only way I think it would be reasonable to be a holder here.</p>
      <p>For these reasons, I don't see much opportunity risk in rotating out of Target stock today.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Long-Only Rotational Strategy Suggestion</b>
      </p>
      <p>I am currently writing a series about high-quality businesses that are overvalued, like Target. You can read about the strategy in these three articles: <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4285297-ignore-sentiment-cycles-risk">Part 1</a> "Ignore Sentiment Cycles At Your Own Risk," <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4285934-mitigating-sentiment-cycles-ignore-sentiment-cycles-risk-part-2">Part 2</a> "Mitigating Sentiment Cycles" and <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4287258-sentiment-cycles-sell-buy-back">Part 3</a> "Sentiment Cycles: When To Sell And When To Buy Back Again."</p>
      <p>My current suggestion is that owners of Target who would like to avoid part of the eventual correction in the stock rotate out of it and into a 50/50 mix of the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Low Volatility ETF (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPLV">SPLV</a>) and the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight ETF (<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RSP">RSP</a>) until Target's price falls to a more reasonable level that offers better forward returns. My expectation is that owners would be able to increase the number of Target shares they own by 20-25% using this strategy without spending any additional money. (To see how this strategy works, read the three articles linked above.)</p>
