      <h1>Donor to de Blasio’s old charity sues to block probe of $60K in contributions</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T03:23:07+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 03:23</time> by <a rel="author">Bernadette Hogan and Bruce Golding</a></address>
      <p>A major donor to Mayor de Blasio’s since-shuttered nonprofit is suing to block a state probe of its $60,000 in contributions.</p>
      <p>Broadway Stages claims that the Joint Commission on Public Ethics exceeded its authority by slapping the TV and film production company with an Aug. 19 subpoena.</p>
      <p>The subpoena seeks copies of “all communications” between Broadway Stages and de Blasio, his defunct Campaign for One New York charity and lobbyist James Capalino, according to the lawsuit filed in state Supreme Court in Albany.</p>
      <p>Broadway Stages — whose CEO and president, Gina Argento, raised more than $110,000 for de Blasio’s 2013 campaign and transition, making her Hizzoner’s No. 2 bundler — claims that state law allows JCOPE to investigate only officials who receive gifts, and not those who give them.</p>
      <p>Its lawsuit, filed Thursday, also denies that the company donated to CONY “at the direction of the Mayor (or any other public official).”</p>
      <p>City records show that <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/13/donor-to-de-blasio-slush-fund-hit-with-10k-fine-by-state-authorities/">Capalino formerly lobbied City Hall</a> on behalf of Broadway Stages, whose clients include such popular shot-in-the-city TV shows as “Ray Donovan,” “Billions” and “Mr. Robot.”</p>
      <p>JCOPE declined to comment.</p>
