      <h1>Calgarians 'don't want party politics': Nenshi reacts to conservative municipal slate</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T03:02:44+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 03:02</time> by <a rel="author">Meghan Potkins, Calgary Herald</a></address>
      <p>The next municipal election might be two years away, but a right-wing advocacy group is already making preparations to back a slate of conservative candidates in 2021.</p>
      <p>The Progressive Group for Independent Business (PGIB), a membership-funded group headed by Craig Chandler, is backing four council incumbents and making plans to back challengers in a number of other wards. Chandler told Postmedia that his group will be endorsing councillors Sean Chu, Peter Demong, Jeromy Farkas and Joe Magliocca in the next election.</p>
      <p>Chandler says the group has begun door-knocking in south Calgary; a fundraiser is planned for January and the website <a href="http://takebackcityhall.org/">takebackcityhall.org</a> has been launched.</p>
      <p>Municipal slates, fixtures of civic races in Montreal and Vancouver, haven’t gained much traction in Calgary over the years. In 2017, however, the conservative Students Count slate successfully captured three seats in school trustee races.</p>
      <p>Mayor Naheed Nenshi said Monday that Calgarians have long tended to prefer voting for individuals at the municipal level rather than parties.</p>
      <p>“Calgarians understand that they want the best possible people to represent them at city council, that they don’t want party politics,” said Nenshi. “They don’t want (politicians) to vote mindlessly because they’re told to vote that way. They actually want their city councillors to be thoughtful about what they’re voting on.”</p>

      <p>Chandler said Monday that candidates backed by PGIB won’t be members of an actual party or whipped on votes like a party would be; instead, they’ll simply be vetted by the group before being endorsed as candidates. Chandler also said he will be running in Ward 12 in the next election since he believes Coun. Shane Keating won’t be running again.</p>
      <p>The group already has the backing of local developers and will be pushing an agenda of lower taxes and lean government, said Chandler.</p>
      <p>“What we’ve done by creating takebackcityhall.org this early is we’re not going to split the vote in certain areas,” Chandler said. “Everyone’s talking to us. We’re using the UCP (United Conservative Party) infrastructure, the CPC (Conservative Party of Canada) infrastructure to make sure there is no conservative vote splitting.”</p>
      <p>Chandler himself has a chequered past with Alberta conservatives.</p>
      <p>He had to <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/politics/controversial-activist-chandler-steps-down-from-pc-board">step down in 2016 from the Progressive Conservative party board</a> after he accused Earls restaurants of supporting terrorism in a social media post. Chandler was also previously rejected as a provincial Tory candidate in 2008 after an organization that he headed, the Concerned Christian Coalition, was rebuked for anti-gay comments.</p>

      <p>Reacting to the news Monday, Nenshi said the virtue of the existing system is that the success of any proposal depends on council members being swayed by the strength of the debate.</p>
      <p>“(M)aking sure that there is debate and people are listening to one another is actually pretty darn good government,” said Nenshi. “And why we would want anyone to emulate question period at the Legislature and the House of Commons?”</p>
