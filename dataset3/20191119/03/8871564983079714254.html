      <h1>‘He wanted others to suffer like he did’: Police arrest W. Jakarta man accused of throwing acid on 9 women</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T03:33:05+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 03:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Jakarta" target="_blank">Coconuts Jakarta</a></address>
      <p>Police in West Jakarta on Saturday arrested a man who allegedly threw acid on nine women — most of them junior high school students — on three separate occasions over the past couple of weeks.</p>
      <p>According to reports, the suspect, who is identified by his initials FY, carried out his first attack in Kebon Jeruk on Nov. 5, during which he threw acid on two junior high students. Three days later, he threw acid on a 60-year-old woman in Meruya. After a period of inactivity, FY carried his largest attack in Srengseng, in which he splashed acid on six junior high students.</p>
      <p>Police say FY, an AC technician familiar with chemicals, used a low concentration acidic substance in his attacks, so his victims suffered minor burns.</p>
      <p>The police conducted a mental health evaluation on FY following his arrest. Kasandra Putranto, a psychologist assigned to his assessment, said FY suffered an unspecified accident at work in 2015, which left him with long-term injuries.</p>
      <p>“His eyes, his back ache and they can’t be as they were because of the injuries. That’s the problem, there was no help for him to get medication. What he wanted is that medication,” <a href="https://kumparan.com/kumparannews/peneror-air-keras-di-jakbar-ingin-orang-lain-rasakan-penderitaannya-1sHMaYGD1xq?utm_source=LINE&amp;utm_medium=Aggregator">Kasandra told </a><a href="https://kumparan.com/kumparannews/peneror-air-keras-di-jakbar-ingin-orang-lain-rasakan-penderitaannya-1sHMaYGD1xq?utm_source=LINE&amp;utm_medium=Aggregator"><i>Kumparan </i></a><a href="https://kumparan.com/kumparannews/peneror-air-keras-di-jakbar-ingin-orang-lain-rasakan-penderitaannya-1sHMaYGD1xq?utm_source=LINE&amp;utm_medium=Aggregator">yesterday</a>.</p>
      <p>“He wanted others to suffer like he did,” Kassandra said about FY’s motive for the acid attacks.</p>
      <p>The psychologist also said that FY doesn’t necessarily hate women, rather that he believed it was more practical for him to carry out his attacks on women.</p>
      <p>“He chose his victims based on his belief that women are inferior and he chose those who wore long skirts … He thought that those wearing long skirts can’t chase him on his motorcycle,” <a href="https://kumparan.com/kumparannews/game-perang-diduga-picu-peneror-air-keras-di-jakbar-jadi-lebih-agresif-1sHMqgOxjDD">Kassandra said</a>.</p>
      <p>Police have charged FY with assault on minors, one count of which is punishable by up to five years in prison, as well as assault under the criminal code, which is also punishable by up to five years in prison.</p>
