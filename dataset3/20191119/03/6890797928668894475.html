      <h1>Fire chiefs return to set Scummo ablaze</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T03:15:21+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 03:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.macrobusiness.com.au/author/david/" target="_blank">Houses and Holes</a></address>
      <p>As they should, at <a href="https://www.news.com.au/technology/environment/records-show-the-worst-bushfires-in-nsw-could-be-yet-to-come/news-story/b4e417bde0f6f593118ed1be2d4ade2b">News</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>NSW hasn’t even entered what’s traditionally the most devastating period of bushfire damage.<br/><br/>“We’ve got the worst to come,” former NSW fire commissioner Greg Mullins told news.com.au.<br/><br/>…“So we need to brace ourselves. If we don’t get summer storms to wet everything down, we are in dire straits.”<br/><br/>Mr Mullins, along with 22 other retired fire and emergency service chiefs, predicted this would be a horror year and urgently sought a meeting with Prime Minister Scott Morrison in April.<br/><br/>…“You don’t need a crystal ball, when you’ve been doing it this long, you know the indicators and it was very clear.”<br/><br/>He also dismissed commentary that it was not the right time to talk about climate change, sledging our political leaders in the process.<br/><br/>“It’s exactly the right time. Parliament is not sitting and politicians have no operational role in responding to fires so what else are they going to do?” he said.<br/><br/>“They are basically on holiday at the moment”.</blockquote>
      <p>It will be intereting to see how the polls track from here. Can’t be good for Scummo, though Paul Keating is doing his best to ensure minimal damage.</p>
      <p>Between climate change and the CCP, I am tempted to reach for the tin foil hat.</p>
