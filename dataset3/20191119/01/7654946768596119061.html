      <h1>Roger Goodell upset over Myles Garrett-Mason Rudolph fight</h1>

      <p>NFL commissioner Roger Goodell backed up the league’s decision <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/myles-garrett-suspended-indefinitely-for-browns-steelers-fight/">to suspend Myles Garrett indefinitely</a> after the Browns’ star whacked Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph on the head with a helmet last week.</p>
      <p>“It was in my view and I think our football people something that had to be dealt with very quickly and very firmly to make it clear to the players that it’s not acceptable, and to the clubs,” <a href="https://vimeo.com/otgexp">Goodell told the Pre-Flight Playbook</a> in his first public comments on the incident.</p>
      <p>“There’s no place for that in the game,” Goodell said. “He will not play the rest of the season. He will probably meet with us some time in the offseason, and I think we’ll make a judgment on does he have remorse?”</p>
      <p>That meeting will instead come Wednesday, <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001078367/article/myles-garrett-suspension-appeal-set-for-wednesday">according to NFL Network</a>, when the 23-year-old Garrett will appeal the suspension, which at a minimum will keep him out for the rest of the regular season and potential playoff games (Goodell’s comments came before Garrett’s decision to file an appeal).</p>
      <p>Garrett, who has since apologized, reportedly will argue players cannot be suspended for an indefinite period of time for on-field acts under the collective bargaining agreement.</p>
      <p>Pittsburgh’s Maurkice Pouncey (three games) and Cleveland’s Larry Ogunjobi (one game) are also appealing their suspensions, handed down for their roles in the fight that broke out after Garrett and Rudolph scuffled on the field following a sack.</p>
