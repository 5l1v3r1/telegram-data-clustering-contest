      <p>Battling <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/billy-connolly">Billy Connolly</a> looks fit as a fiddle in a video that will delight his millions of fans.</p>
      <p>The comedian, 77, was diagnosed with <a href="https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/donate?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIlvWdkYL15QIVVvhRCh3a2AZOEAAYASAAEgLkUvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">Parkinson’s</a> in 2013 and admitted recently the disease was taking a hold.</p>
      <p>But the Big Yin's wife <a href="https://twitter.com/PamelaStephensn/status/1196493261537460225">Pamela Stephenson</a> posted a clip of her husband breaking into a sprint along a street on their break in America.</p>
      <p>The Scot looked a picture of health as he was snapped running in Florida Keys with a big smile on his face.</p>
      <p>She captioned the video: "Billy’s doing soooo well! Caught him running just now!"</p>

      <p>He told Chris Evans recently that he has "started to droll" because of his condition.</p>
      <p>The Big Yin said: “This disease, it gives you a new thing to deal with every now and again. I walk unsteady.</p>
      <p>“I’ve started to drool. That’s a new one for me!”</p>
      <p>“A doctor in America told me it’s incurable and I said, ‘get a grip on yourself, say we’ve yet to find a cure’, give a man a light at the end of the tunnel. Incurable is such an awful thing to say to somebody.”</p>
      <p>Sir Billy recently told the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/">Daily Record</a> that he wasn't sure if he could perform in his current "state of mind".</p>

      <p>Judging by today's video, funnyman he looks like he's still on top form.</p>
      <p>He also said last week he was  <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/billy-connolly-i-want-bed-20896363">trying to find a bed that throws him out in the morning</a> .</p>
      <p>The comedy legend said he’d love to find an alarm clock similar to one created by his hero – Dunbar-born naturalist John Muir.</p>
