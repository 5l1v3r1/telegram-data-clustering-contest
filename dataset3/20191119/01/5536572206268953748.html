      <h1>MLB Execs Reportedly Think Buzzing Bandages May Have Been Used To Relay Pitches From Astros (PICS)</h1>

      <p>Another day, another Astros related cheating story.</p>
      <p>It was just last week when a bombshell report surfaced that detailed the system the Astros used to steal signs during their 2017 World Series championship season.</p>
      <p>Former Astros pitcher Mike Fiers and other ex employees, blew the whistle on the organization on how they reportedly had a center-field camera fixed on the catcher where somebody would decode his signs on a monitor in the hallway between the dugout and clubhouse, and banged a garbage can to relay incoming pitches to the hitter.</p>
      <p>The latest accusation comes from Joel Sherman of the New York Post who is throwing out accusations that the Astros players may have worn a buzzer device on their body to help relay signs.</p>

      <blockquote>“In recent days I have had scouts and executives talk to me about a variety of methods they think have been or could be employed, such as a realistic-looking electronic bandage placed on a player’s body that buzzes in real time to signal what is coming — one buzz for a fastball, for example — if the surveillance determines what type of pitching is coming. One person I spoke to has ties to the Astros and said he already had spoken to MLB’s investigators.”</blockquote>
      <p>A picture has since surfaced online that may point to what the article is speaking of.</p>

      <p>Stealing signs is not explicitly against MLB rules, but most teams do it the old-fashioned way, where as the Astros are being accused of going to extreme and unseen measures to steal signs and seemingly benefited greatly off of it.</p>
