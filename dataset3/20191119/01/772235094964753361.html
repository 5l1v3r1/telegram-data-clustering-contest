      <p><b>Nissan</b> has recalled more than <b>6000 Pathfinder large SUVs</b> in <b>Australia, </b>as part of a wider global campaign involving more than 450,000 vehicles.</p>
      <p>A faulty oil seal in the antilock braking system (ABS) assembly could cause a brake fluid leak in affected <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/nissan/pathfinder/">Pathfinders</a>, which can create an electrical short that, in extreme cases, leads to a fire.</p>
      <p>The ABS warning light on the dashboard will illuminate in affected cars. If the light is illuminated for more than 10 seconds, <a href="https://www.caradvice.com.au/nissan/">Nissan</a> advises drivers to park the car and have it towed to their nearest dealer.</p>
      <p>There were no reports of fires caused by the fault in Australia at the time of writing â€“ there are <b>6076 vehicles</b> included in the recall, across the hybrid and petrol line-up.</p>

      <p>"Nissan is committed to the safety, security and satisfaction of our customers and their passengers," the company said in a statement.</p>
      <p>"Nissan is conducting a Voluntary Safety Recall Campaign on certain MY2016 -2018 Nissan Pathfinder vehicles to replace the Antilock Braking System (ABS) actuator.</p>
      <p>"Once parts availability is confirmed, owners will receive a notification letter asking them to bring their vehicle to an authorized Nissan dealer to have the remedy work completed at no cost for parts or labor."</p>
