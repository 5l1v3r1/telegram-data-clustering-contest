      <h1>Another councillor, Labor minister named as receiving donations from developer in corruption probe</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T01:28:12+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 01:28</time> by <a rel="author">Royce Millar and Ben Schneiders</a></address>
      <p>Former Liberal MP Gary Rowe has become the third councillor at the City of Casey to become embroiled in alleged undeclared business dealings with John Woodman, the developer at the centre of the Victorian anti-corruption commission’s probe of land deals in Melbourne’s sprawling south-east.</p>
      <p>The inquiry also heard that senior Labor minister Martin Pakula, an MP in Melbourne’s south-east, received a donation of $20,800, while Labor’s successful candidate for the state seat of Cranbourne, Pauline Richards, received a donation of about $20,000.</p>

      <p>At an IBAC public hearing on Tuesday developer Mr Woodman confirmed he raised more than $10,000 at Crown Casino for Cr Rowe in the Casey council election in 2016.</p>
      <p>Cr Rowe had initially been a key critic of a proposal to rezone a large property owned by construction giant Leightons from industrial to residential in Cranbourne West. Cr Rowe later changed his position on the rezoning, which could have led to a $100 million windfall for the developers, who later changed their name to CIMIC.</p>
      <p>The council had opposed the rezoning in 2014 but back flipped and supported it the following year. The rezoning proposal is now with planning minister Richard Wynne.</p>

      <p>Cr Rowe hung up when called for comment by <i>The Age </i>on Tuesday. Mr Woodman denied to the inquiry that Cr Rowe had been a thorn in his side or had felt displeasure towards him.</p>
      <p>The inquiry also heard that Woodman-linked companies dramatically increased donations to Victorian Labor ahead of the 2018 state election. Donations to the party and its candidates went from $94,500 in 2015 to $157,900 in 2018. Donations to the Liberals for the 2018 election fell from $80,000 to $63,000.</p>
      <p>Mr Pakula on Tuesday confirmed he had received the donation but denied approaching Mr Woodman for it.</p>
      <p>"I've never approached him for a donation," the Racing Minister said. "What may have occurred is that people organising a fundraiser for me may have invited him to attend a fundraiser."</p>
      <p>Mr Woodman, appearing before the inquiry, said he had supported local candidates in the area, from both sides of politics, for “many years”. He said he had based his political donations “on my perception of their ability to promote our state”.</p>

      <p>On Monday the hearing revealed that<a href="https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p53bkb.html"> companies linked to Mr Woodman paid two councillors at Casey council more than $1.2 million</a>. A lawyer for the Victorian anti-corruption commission said this was an attempt to win favourable planning decisions.</p>
      <p>IBAC’s Operation Sandon, the most significant probe into alleged planning-related corruption in Victoria in decades.</p>
      <p>Counsel assisting the hearing, Michael Tovey, QC, revealed the extent of the financial links between Mr Woodman and councillors, and the hundreds of thousands of dollars in political donations he had made to political candidates on both sides of state politics. Mr Tovey said some payments were in cash and appeared to be "patently corrupt".</p>
      <p>Key issues of interest were central to stories in <i>The Sunday Age</i> in October and November last year, including the proposed rezoning of land in Cranbourne West owned by construction giant Leighton, and council decisions favourable to Woodman-linked company Wolfdene, including at the Pavilion housing development and the construction of an intersection at Hall's Road in Cranbourne.</p>
      <p>Called to give evidence, Mr Woodman denied he used money to gain favour with councils and said his generous political donations were intended to encourage "good governance".</p>
