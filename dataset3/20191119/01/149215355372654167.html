      <h1>IRS whistleblower reportedly met with Senate staffers this month</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T01:10:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 01:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://theweek.com/authors/catherine-garcia" target="_blank">Catherine Garcia</a></address>
      <p>A career official at the Internal Revenue Service who filed a whistleblower complaint over the summer, accusing at least one political appointee at the Treasury Department of trying to interfere with an audit of President Trump's tax returns, met with Senate Finance Committee staff members earlier this month, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/18/us/politics/irs-whistle-blower-trump.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage">a congressional aide told<i> The New York Times</i>.</a></p>
      <p>The whistleblower spoke with staffers for Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), the chairman and ranking Democrat of the Senate Finance Committee. The whistleblower contacted the staff of the House Ways and Means Committee in July, claiming that political appointees were getting involved in the audit and putting pressure of some kind on senior IRS officials, the <i>Times</i> reports.</p>
      <p>Details of the allegations remain unclear, and the House Ways and Means Committee is still reviewing the complaint. "We generally do not comment on whistleblower meetings, their contents, or even if they happened," Michael Zona, a spokesman for Grassley, told the <i>Times</i>. "Additionally, federal law prohibits the discussion of protected taxpayer information."</p>
      <p>A person familiar with the matter told the <i>Times</i> the complaint does not directly implicate Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who has refused to comply with a congressional request to release six years worth of Trump's personal and business tax returns.</p>
