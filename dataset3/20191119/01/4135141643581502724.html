      <p><b>EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP)</b> — Xavier Tillman scored a career-high 21 points and grabbed 10 rebounds to help No. 3 Michigan State tune up with a 94-46 win over Charleston Southern on Monday night.</p>
      <p>The Spartans (3-1) were without starting forward Aaron Henry, who rolled both ankles in last week’s win over then-No. 12 Seton Hall, in the on-campus game that is part of the Maui Invitational.</p>
      <p>Michigan State’s Gabe Brown made his first career start in place of Henry and the sophomore scored a season-high 12 points. Freshman Rocket Watts had a season-high 11 points, making another start in place of injured Joshua Langford.</p>
      <p>Cassius Winston added 11 points and eight assists for the Spartans. He told their fans they’re keeping him going while dealing with the death of his brother earlier this month.</p>
      <p>The Buccaneers (1-4) have had four straight lopsided losses since opening with a win over Columbia International.</p>
      <p>Charleston Southern’s Dontrell Shuler had 15 points and Terence Porter scored 11 points.</p>
      <p>The Buccaneers scored first and led for 15 seconds before the Spartans took over. Michigan State led 31-9 midway through the first half before taking a 40-18 lead at halftime.</p>
      <p>The Spartans did not let up in the second half, building a 40-plus point lead to help prepare for tougher competition next week in Hawaii at the Maui Invitational.</p>

        <b>BIG PICTURE</b>
      </p>
      <p>Charleston Southern: The Big South team took the game to make some money and gain experience against one of the top teams in the country.</p>
      <p>Michigan State: Henry’s injury is potentially problematic for a team already without Langford, who is out until at least January with a foot injury.</p>
