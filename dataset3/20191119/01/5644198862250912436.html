      <p>MADRID: Top-flight female footballers in Spain have agreed to suspend a playing strike after securing an agreement to reopen negotiations over pay, it was announced on Monday (Nov 18).</p>
      <p>All eight Primera Division matches on Saturday and Sunday had to be postponed as players chose to boycott fixtures following more than a year of unsuccessful talks with Spanish unions and clubs.</p>

      <p>But the Association of Women's players (AFE) has confirmed negotiations will resume until Dec 20.</p>
      <p>"After the success of the strike, an agreement has been reached to work on the proposal," said the AFE.</p>
      <p>Players are demanding part-time salaries be worth a minimum of €12,000 (US$13,297), which is 75 per cent of the minimum amount for full-time contracts.</p>
      <p>Clubs had proposed part-time salaries of €8,000 but the AFE has suggested the Association of Women's Football Clubs (ACFF) is prepared to give way.</p>
      <p>"Due to the strike, the footballers have managed to remove the red lines around the 75 per cent for part-time contracts and €16,000 minimum salary," the AFE added.</p>
      <p>Ainhoa Tirapu, goalkeeper for Athletic Bilbao and the Spanish national team, said last month: "We are footballers 24 hours a day, 100 per cent of the time.</p>
      <p>"We hope to reach an agreement at some point but we had to take drastic action because the time for women's football is now."</p>
