The series will be adapted from the bestselling fiction novel of the same name.</p>
      <p><a href="https://ew.com/tv/2019/11/18/riley-keough-daisy-jones-and-the-six-amazon/"><i>Entertainment Weekly</i></a> reports that the <i>Girlfriend Experience</i> star will portray the main character, Daisy Jones, from Taylor Jenkins Reid’s book.</p>
      <p>Amazon purchased the rights to <i>Daisy Jones and the Six</i> this past summer and officially ordered it to series in July, reports <i><a href="https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/amazon-daisy-jones-the-six-series-reese-witherspoon-1202883814/">Variety</a></i>. For those who haven’t had the chance to read it yet, <i>Daisy Jones and the Six</i> is a fictional story about a notorious rock band from the 1970s. It follows the band’s rise and then their eventual fall.</p>
      <p>Thus far, Keough is the only official casting announcement but we do know that <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5742660/reese-witherspoon-dress-cma-awards-2019/">Reese Witherspoon</a> will serve as an executive producer. <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/reese-witherspoon-sets-70s-rock-drama-daisy-jones-six-series-at-amazon-1129693"><i>The Hollywood Reporter</i></a> previously wrote an article about Witherspoon joining the Amazon project after she chose Reid’s novel as one of her book club picks. The <i>Big Little Lies</i> star has been vocal about her love of Reid’s work.</p>
      <blockquote>“As soon as I started reading <i>Daisy Jones &amp; The Six</i>, I immediately fell head over heels in love with it, and I’m thrilled to be bringing it to the screen with Amazon and Jen Salke, whose passionate pursuit of the material spoke volumes.”</blockquote>
      <p>The <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> article also states that Niki Caro — director of Disney’s <i>Mulan</i> — will join Witherspoon as an executive producer, in addition to directing several episodes of the series.</p>
      <p>As for Keough, her big breakout role came in 2016 after she starred in Season 1 of Steven Soderbergh’s Starz series, <i>The Girlfriend Experience</i>.
