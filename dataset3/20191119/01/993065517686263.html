      <p>A DUP MLA facing enforcement action for building a triple garage at his home without approval is now seeking planning permission – despite claiming none was needed.</p>
      <p>Trevor Clarke, who has also been under pressure over <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2019/07/30/news/dup-mla-s-sideline-business-lobbying-for-planning-applicants-1672971/">a sideline planning lobby business</a>, made the u-turn after discussing the issue with planning officials.</p>
      <p>The huge garage constructed beside his rural two-storey home <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2019/09/09/news/dup-s-trevor-clarke-faces-planning-probe-for-triple-garage-built-without-approval-1706767/">has been the subject of a council investigation</a> into alleged planning breaches for more than a year.</p>
      <p>Mid and East Antrim council <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2019/09/03/news/dup-s-linda-clarke-gave-council-cash-to-son-s-business-1701176/">has also been examining a printing business which is run by his son</a> from the address without planning approval.</p>

      <p>When the enforcement probe first publicly emerged in September, Mr Clarke maintained that planning permission was not required.</p>
      <p>A DUP spokesman for Mr Clarke at the time said: "Planning permission is not required for a detached domestic garage if it meets certain conditions.</p>
      <p>"Mr Clarke's view is that the garage on his property meets these, despite a complaint submitted by a political rival."</p>
      <p>But the MLA has now submitted a retrospective planning application for the garage near Randalstown in Co Antrim.</p>
      <p>The council confirmed it received an application, but it has not yet been placed on the online planning portal as officials have requested further information.</p>
      <p>The garage, which has three separate garage doors and a pitched roof, was built beside the Clarkes' home in recent years.</p>
      <p>The Clarkes also run a car sales business from the address.</p>

      <p>Mid and East Antrim council had said an earlier investigation found the use of the land for car sales was "immune from enforcement" due to legislative time limits.</p>
      <p>An enforcement investigation was later opened in August 2018 after the garage was discovered during a fresh planning complaint about the car sales business.</p>
      <p>"Council is currently investigating alleged planning breaches at this location," it added.</p>
      <p>According to guidance on the Planning NI website, planning permission for a detached garage is not required if its maximum height is four metres; the area covered by it and any other outbuildings is not more than half the total area of the house; and it is used solely for domestic purposes.</p>
      <p>Images of AC Print's products posted on its Facebook page appear to show them positioned inside a building adjacent to garage doors.</p>
      <p>A council spokesman said: "A planning enforcement investigation is still ongoing and the council is unable to comment on the details of this.</p>
      <p>"The council can confirm an application was received regarding this property which was returned with a request for further information.</p>

      <p>"Following the receipt of the complete application the details will appear on the planning portal."</p>
      <p>A DUP spokesman for the South Antrim MLA said: "Mr Clarke has discussed the issue with planning officials. An application has been lodged to regularise the development."</p>

        <b>Triple garage probe among several Clarke controversies</b>
      </p>
      <p>THE triple garage probe is among several controversies to emerge in recent months surrounding DUP MLA Trevor Clarke and his wife, DUP councillor Linda Clarke.</p>
      <p>In July, an Irish News investigation revealed the Clarkes' sideline planning consultancy business.</p>
      <p>Mr Clarke has rejected concerns that Versatile Consultancy breaches assembly rules which prohibit paid advocacy.</p>
      <p>Both have insisted they "made all the relevant declarations and adhered to all rules".</p>
      <p>A council watchdog has also opened investigations into alleged conflicts of interest involving Mrs Clarke's role on Antrim and Newtownabbey council.</p>
      <p>It emerged Mrs Clarke participated in council votes for planning applications Mr Clarke lobbied on in 2017 during a period when he was not an MLA.</p>
      <p>Mrs Clarke was also involved in awarding more than £4,500 in council contracts to their son's printing firm AC Print, which is based at the family home outside Randalstown, Co Antrim.</p>
      <p>AC Print has also been embroiled in a police probe into claims of "dirty tricks" during May's council elections.</p>
      <p>A TUV man complained that a DUP mock ballot paper produced by AC Print described him as an Alliance candidate. The DUP said it was a "printing error".</p>
