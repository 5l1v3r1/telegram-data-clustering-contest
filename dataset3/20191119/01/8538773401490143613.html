      <p>The Fantasy 32 analyzes the NFL from a fantasy perspective, with at least one mention of each of the league's 32 teams. Though efficiency will be discussed plenty, the column will lean heavily on usage data, as volume is king (by far) in fantasy football. Use these tidbits to make the best waiver-wire, trade and lineup decisions for the upcoming week and beyond. Be sure to check back each week of the season for a new version of the Fantasy 32.</p>
      <h3>Opportunity alert</h3>
      <p>Throughout the below team-by-team rundowns, I'll be referencing "OFP" and "OTD." OFP stands for opportunity-adjusted fantasy points. Imagine a league in which players are created equal. OFP is a statistic that weighs every pass/carry/target and converts the data into one number that indicates a player's opportunity to score fantasy points, or his "expected" fantasy point total. For example, if a player has an OFP of 14.5, it means that a league-average player who saw the same workload in the same location on the field would have scored 14.5 fantasy points. FORP is the difference between a player's actual fantasy point total and his OFP. OTD works the same way, except instead of fantasy points, it's touchdowns. Volume is king in fantasy football, so this is not information you want to overlook.</p>
      <p>That said, here is the post-Week 11 OFP Leaderboard:</p>

      <p>
        <b>
          <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/ari/arizona-cardinals">Arizona Cardinals</a>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>It appears that <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2979843/kenyan-drake">Kenyan Drake</a> has taken over as the lead back in Arizona. After playing 74% of the snaps during his first two games with the team, Drake was on the field for a season-high 90% of the team's offensive plays against the 49ers on Sunday. Drake carried the ball 16 times for 67 yards and totaled 13 yards on seven targets. No other Arizona back touched the football, with <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2508176/david-johnson">David Johnson</a> limited to seven snaps. Johnson opened the season with five top-12 fantasy outings in his first six games, but hasn't finished a week better than 65th since. Perhaps Johnson will play a role following the team's Week 12 bye, but he can't be trusted right now. <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3119195/chase-edmonds">Chase Edmonds</a> is also due back from injury following the bye. Drake, meanwhile, has posted five consecutive top-23 fantasy weeks and is in the RB2 mix.</p>
      <p>

          <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/atl/atlanta-falcons">Atlanta Falcons</a>

      </p>
      <p>With <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3043275/austin-hooper">Austin Hooper</a> sidelined, <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14099/luke-stocker">Luke Stocker</a> played 68% of the snaps and <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3118954/jaeden-graham">Jaeden Graham</a> 52% during Sunday's win in Carolina. Stocker was targeted on one of his eight pass routes and Graham posted a 2-23-0 receiving line on a pair of targets while running 19 routes. Graham is clearly the preferred pass-catching tight end, but the committee approach is unlikely to yield much fantasy production. This situation can be ignored in most formats, but those desperate in in two-TE leagues can take a shot on Graham.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/bal/baltimore-ravens">Baltimore Ravens</a>

      </p>
      <p><a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3051926/gus-edwards">Gus Edwards</a> ripped off a 63-yard touchdown and posted a strong 8-112-1 rushing line against Houston on Sunday. Edwards had been unlucky in the scoring department earlier this season, but that has leveled out a bit in recent weeks (2.9 OTD, two touchdowns). Operating as a situational player. Edwards has cleared eight carries in a game once (Week 1) and has gone over 56 rushing yards once (Sunday) this season. He also has been a nonfactor as a receiver, having failed to see a target during his past five games. Edwards would be a must-add in the event of a Mark Ingram injury, but has no standalone value.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/buf/buffalo-bills">Buffalo Bills</a>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3930086/dawson-knox">Dawson Knox</a> scored a 23-yard touchdown on one of his two catches Sunday. Knox now has a catch of at least 20 yards in five different games this season. Despite the occasional big plays, Knox remains well off the fantasy radar. The rookie has yet to clear six targets in a game and has gone over 32 yards once during his past six outings. He's finished two weeks better than 16th among tight ends in fantasy points. Knox, who has two touchdowns this season, is a terrific dynasty stash, but isn't producing enough for TE1 consideration just yet.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/car/carolina-panthers">Carolina Panthers</a>

      </p>
      <p><a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3115293/kyle-allen">Kyle Allen</a> has attempted 93 passes over the past two weeks. He has a pair of 300-yard games to show, but also has only one touchdown and five interceptions. Allen has now failed to clear two touchdowns in each of his past seven games, falling short of two in five of those outings. Allen has attempted a significant number of low-percentage throws (his 60% expected completion rate is second lowest among 34 qualified quarterbacks), which has led to a weak 6.8 yards per attempt (seventh worst). Allen has managed one weekly fantasy finish better than 14th and it came in his season debut in Week 3. Allen is well off the fantasy radar.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/chi/chicago-bears">Chicago Bears</a>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/17437/taylor-gabriel">Taylor Gabriel</a> matched a career high with 14 targets against the Rams on Sunday. Gabriel didn't take much advantage with a 7-57-0 receiving line, though he has now produced at least 9.3 fantasy points in four consecutive games. Gabriel has been on the field for 82% of Chicago's pass plays and is handling 5.8 targets per game (the latter is down slightly from 6.0 last season). Gabriel's role is enough to keep him in the flex discussion most weeks, but Chicago's struggling offense limits his upside quite a bit. He's not a player to prioritize on waivers.</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15788/tyler-eifert">Tyler Eifert</a> seemed to be on the verge of a resurgence back in Week 8 when he played a season-high 71% of the snaps and posted a 6-74-0 receiving line on nine targets. So much for that. Eifert has played 32% of the snaps in <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3042876/ryan-finley">Ryan Finley</a>'s two starts, posting a 5-41-1 line on eight targets. Eifert continues to play fewer snaps than <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2574576/cj-uzomah">C.J. Uzomah</a> and has one top-10 fantasy week to his name this season. He is no more than a shaky TE2 play.</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3128720/nick-chubb">Nick Chubb</a> has played 77% of the offensive snaps and <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3059915/kareem-hunt">Kareem Hunt</a> 56% in two games since Hunt returned from suspension. Chubb has carried the ball 47 times, run 35 routes and handled five targets during the span. That's compared to 10 carries, 35 routes and 17 targets for Hunt. Chubb hasn't posted a top-12 fantasy week since Week 6, but his heavy rushing volume and an "easy" remaining schedule keep him in the RB1 mix. Hunt has posted 12-plus fantasy points in both games and is playing enough to warrant flex consideration. Hunt is also one of the most-valuable handcuffs in fantasy.</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4036348/michael-gallup">Michael Gallup</a> put up a dominant 9-148-0 receiving line on a team-high 13 targets in Detroit on Sunday. Granted Gallup benefited from <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15863/darius-slay">Darius Slay</a> shadowing a limited <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2976499/amari-cooper">Amari Cooper</a>, but the second-year receiver has now been targeted 10-plus times in back-to-back games and has seven or more targets in six of eight games this season. Gallup has also produced at least one touchdown or 68 yards in six games. Gallup sits 14th at the position in fantasy points per game, though he should be considered a WR3 over the next month against what is a tough schedule (Patriots, Bills, Bears, Rams).</p>

Despite actually being carted to the locker room early in the game, Patrick played 71% of the snaps and was targeted eight times. He responded with a 4-77-0 receiving line. Patrick flashed at times with a 23-315-1 receiving line last season and will be behind only <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3128429/courtland-sutton">Courtland Sutton</a> (nine targets Sunday) and <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4036131/noah-fant">Noah Fant</a> (11) for the rest of the season.

      <p>The Lions threw us another curveball at the running back position Sunday. Detroit activated 2018 seventh-round pick <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3126367/bo-scarbrough">Bo Scarbrough</a> over the weekend and proceeded to both start him and allow him a position-high 47% snap share. The former Cowboys draft pick posted a 14-55-1 rushing line, but wasn't targeted in the game. <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2572861/jd-mckissic">J.D. McKissic</a> (six touches on 23% of the snaps) and <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3915411/ty-johnson">Ty Johnson</a> (three on 32%) were mixed in off the bench. The Lions have no one coming back from injury, so it's possible Scarbrough will remain the lead back for the rest of the season. The 6-foot-1, 235-pound Alabama product projects as a between-the-tackles plodder who will offer the bare minimum as a receiver (think <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3128721/sony-michel">Sony Michel</a>, but in a worse offense). Scarbrough figures to cap out as a flex in PPR leagues, but is worth a waiver claim.</p>
