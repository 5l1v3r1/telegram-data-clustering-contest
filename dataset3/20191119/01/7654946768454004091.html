      <h1>Transit workers’ union demands more cops in NYC subways</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T01:50:04+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 01:50</time> by <a rel="author">David Meyer, Jacob Henry and Bruce Golding</a></address>
      <p>The transit workers’ union demanded Monday that the NYPD step up crime-fighting in the subways, after The Post <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/17/nypd-can-claim-subway-crime-is-down-because-it-only-focuses-on-felony-stats/">revealed a massive spike in offenses</a> that include random assaults on riders.</p>
      <p>Transport Workers Union Local 100 President Tony Utano accused cops of focusing on fare-beaters while MTA employees face “assaults, threats and other forms of disgusting abuse all the time.”</p>
      <p>“The MTA and the city so far have utterly failed to adequately protect transit workers. They have to a much better job deploying officers,” Utano said.</p>
      <p>“We want to see uniformed officers on the trains and platforms and buses, not just standing near turnstiles.”</p>
      <p>The Post exclusively reported that crime in the subway system rose 10.9 percent between Jan. 1 and Sept. 30 of this year, compared to the same period in 2018.</p>
      <p>The increase was driven by a staggering 23 percent surge in complaints about misdemeanor crimes including low-level assault, harassment and groping.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the NYPD has touted a 1.4 percent decline, based solely on the number of serious felonies such as murder, robbery and rape.</p>
      <p>Con Ed worker Thomas Manning, who said he’s been riding the subways for 25 years, complained that “crime is all over the place.”</p>
      <p>“You’d have to be blind not to see it,” the 73-year-old Long Island resident said outside the Fulton Center subway hub in lower Manhattan.</p>
      <p>“It’s way out of hand and I’m sick and tired of it . . . This is bringing the city down.”</p>
      <p>Process server Claude Brown of Brooklyn said that while “I see crime, I haven’t been affected.”</p>
      <p>“My wife is giving me horror stories about people pulling down their pants,” he said. “Do I feel safe? No. Am I on guard? Yes.”</p>
      <p>Paola Nunez, a 33-year-old cleaner from The Bronx, said she’s scared of the “fighting and gangs” she sees underground.</p>
      <p>Outside Brooklyn’s Church Avenue station in Flatbush, Shaquille Renwick, 25, griped that “it’s as if the NYPD can’t multi-task.”</p>
      <p>Renwick feared the situation was likely even worse than statistics show because “so much goes on where I’m sure people didn’t report it.”</p>
      <p>The MTA, which Gov. Cuomo has said will flood the subways with 500 new cops, said that “ensuring public safety is an integral part of the transportation mission.”</p>
      <p>The NYPD referred to a Sunday statement by Transit Chief Edward Delatorre, who said, noting an uptick in sex crimes, “We take these misdemeanor reports extremely seriously.”</p>
      <p>“Major felony crime in transit is down across the city as we have drastically reduced overall arrests while increasing our arrests for violent crime,” he added.</p>
