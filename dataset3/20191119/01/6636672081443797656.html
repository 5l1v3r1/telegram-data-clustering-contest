        <b>NOISE in transistors is a far more complex problem than in thermionic devices.</b>
      </p>
      <p>So, 59 years ago, started a story in Electronics Weekly’s edition of November 2nd 1960</p>
      <p>The story continues:</p>
      <p>Mullard Ltd. are working on the problem of specifying noise and identifying it by parameters.</p>
      <p>“There is need for a relatively simple system of noise parameters,” say Mullard, “which will enable the noise factor obtained when a transistor is fed from any particular source impedance to be calculated.”</p>
      <p>It is hoped for most purposes to reduce these parameters to two, dependent on collector current, and also on collector voltage.</p>
      <p>Work is also being carried out to isolate the components of out- put, due to a drift resulting from temperature change, and those due to noise at extremely low fre- quencies.</p>
      <p>To enable this work to be carried out Mullard have further developed their two-stage temperature controller to the point where a stability, short term, of 100 deg. C is obtainable. </p>
