      <h1>Jennifer Lopez Explains Why She Took On The Super Bowl Halftime Show Gig Despite The Colin Kaepernick Controversy</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T01:57:06+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 01:57</time> by <a rel="author">Ashley Mitchell</a></address>
      <p>It’s no secret that Jennifer Lopez’s decision to perform at the Super Bowl is considered at least controversial by many! That being said, the singer doesn’t regret it and she defended herself during a new interview.</p>
      <p>As you may be aware, despite the whole Colin Kaepernick drama with the NFL, J.Lo. did not turn down the Halftime Show gig in support of his cause.</p>
      <p>Jen is set to take the stage in 2020 for about 12 to 14 minutes and the artist argued that for her, that time she’ll get at the huge event will help her prove her worth!</p>
      <p>That being said, Lopez just wants to focus on giving her fans what they want during the upcoming Super Bowl which is a ‘beautiful celebration.’</p>
      <p>The star is set to share the stage with none other than Shakira.</p>
      <p>While chatting with GQ, Jen got into more detail as to why she took on the gig even though she was aware that would make some people mad.</p>
      <p>Asked if she had any ‘conflicting feelings’ about it, she was quick to say ‘no.’</p>
      <p>J.Lo. then went on to explain: ‘I understand people not wanting to do it. Everyone has to make their own choices. They have to feel good about what they are doing.’</p>
      <p>As the interviewer also mentioned, by saying yes to the Halftime Performance, Jennifer went ‘against the grain’ since other celebs such as Rihanna, turned it down in support of Colin.</p>
      <p>‘I feel like it is an amazing platform and one of the biggest in the whole world to put out whatever message that you want to put out there. Whatever message of love I think it is taking a chance to do it. I feel that it is a great thing to have 2 Latina women headlining the Super Bowl, in Miami and what we could do with those 12 to 14 minutes to make people understand our worth and our value in this country.… I believe it could be a very beautiful celebration,’ Jen went on to say.</p>
