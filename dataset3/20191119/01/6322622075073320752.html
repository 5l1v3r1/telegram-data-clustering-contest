      <p>KUALA LUMPUR: Offshore investors’ selling momentum on Bursa Malaysia gained pace last week, as they dumped RM408.5 million net of Malaysian equities last week, compared with RM237.2 million in the prior week, according to MIDF Amanah Investment Bank Bhd Research.</p>
      <p>In his weekly fund flow report yesterday, MIDF Research analyst Adam M Rahim said the week started off on a sluggish tone as international funds offloaded RM129.3 million of local equities last Monday. Selling activity, he said, was triggered by violent protests in Hong Kong, which caused the Hang Seng Index to face its fourth biggest drop of the year.</p>
      <p>“The foreign net outflow slowed down to RM12.9 million [last] Tuesday, as investors awaited a speech by President Donald Trump on US trade policy and news he will likely delay a decision on whether to slap tariffs on European autos.</p>
      <p>“International funds were then back on their feet to dump RM141.2 million net [last] Wednesday, causing the local stock barometer to face its largest decline since early September,” he said. “Shock waves were sent throughout the market as Trump hinted that existing tariffs on China will be raised if no deal is made.”</p>
      <p>Foreign investors later sold RM68.2 million net as weak Chinese economic data — industrial output rose by 4.7% year-on-year (y-o-y), which were below estimates of 5.4%, while fixed asset investment grew at the slowest pace since 1998 — showed the need for a phase one trade deal with the US to restore business confidence.</p>
      <p>They then marked their sixth straight day of selling after RM57 million net of local equities were sold, as risk-on mood was tempered by Malaysia’s third quarter of 2019 gross domestic product growth of 4.4% y-o-y, the weakest in a year.</p>
      <p>The month of November has so far seen a foreign net outflow of RM594 million. “Meanwhile, on a year-to-date basis, foreign funds have taken out RM8.98 billion of local equities from Malaysia, making up 76.8% of last year’s total foreign outflow of RM11.69 billion,” he said.</p>
      <p>Equity markets worldwide, meanwhile, ended mixed last week following the political unrest in Hong Kong and fresh concerns on the trade front in the earlier part of the week, Adam said, while the Brent crude oil price ended 1.3% higher for the week after settling at US$63.30 (RM262.70) per barrel, a level not seen in seven weeks.</p>
      <p>In Asia, international investors continued to make their way into Asian markets for the sixth uninterrupted week, albeit at a substantially slower momentum, he said.</p>
