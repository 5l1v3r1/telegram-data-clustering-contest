      <p>A Duncan man has been sentenced in a case the SPCA calls among the most shocking cases of animal cruelty they've ever seen.</p>
      <p>Anderson Joe was given a lifetime ban on owning animals and a 90-day suspended sentence. The dog was found on his property tied on a short leash to a tree. The dog, named Teddy, was not only several malnourished, it's leash and collar were so tight around its neck, its head became severely swollen. It died two days after it was rescued.</p>
      <p>“This is one of the most profoundly shocking and disturbing cases of abuse we have ever witnessed,” B.C. SPCA Chief Prevention and Enforcement Officer Marcie Moriarty says in a  news release. “No sentence will ever bring this poor dog back or address the level of suffering he endured. But our goal was always to ensure this individual was never allowed to inflict this kind of pain on another animal again, so we are pleased with the lifetime ban.”</p>
      <p>The B.C. SPCA says in a news release issued today, Nov. 18, they received a report of a dog in distress on Feb. 16, 2018. When the constables arrived, they found a medium-sized brown dog on a tether that was only few inches long standing in large pile of mud and feces, according to Moriarty.</p>
      <p>“As (the constables) got closer there was an overpowering stench and they realized that not only was the dog severely emaciated but his collar was deeply embedded into his neck causing massive infection,” Moriarty says, adding the dog’s head was swollen to two to three times its normal size.</p>
      <p>Using bolt cutters, the constables freed the dog and immediately rushed him into an emergency veterinary clinic. But despite extensive emergency treatment, the dog succumbed to his critical condition two days later.</p>
