      <p>STELLARTON, N.S. -- A Nova Scotia woman perusing some old paper money on sale at a weekend market has found what she believes is her late mother's signature on an old $2 bill.</p>
      <p>A friend had asked her to go to the weekend craft market, which she says she wouldn't normally attend.</p>
      <p>"Sorta not my scene," says Marlene Wells.</p>
      <p>But she went and bumped into her old friend Steve Brennan, who had a table set up.</p>
      <p>"He's actually a coin collector -- a money note collector," Wells said.</p>
      <p>Wells is originally from Newfoundland and she was looking for some old discontinued money.</p>
      <p>"We talked about Newfoundland coins," Wells said.</p>
      <p>She was looking at the items on Brennan's table when she stumbled upon some old Canadian currency.</p>
      <p>"When I looked down at the $2 bills, this name was on the bill," Wells said. "Shirley was on the bill."</p>
      <p>That got her attention because her late mother's name was Shirley.</p>
      <p>She then studied the bill and said to Brennan.</p>
      <p>"I think that's my mother's signature on a $2 bill," Brennan says.</p>
      <p>Wells' mother has been dead for 12 years, but she recognized her handwriting right away.</p>
      <p>"The emotions that came over me, I can't describe," Wells said. "My stomach did flip flops."</p>
      <p>Brennan gave her the bill -- free of charge -- and Wells took it home, dug out her mother's diary, and sure enough, the signature was a spot-on match.</p>
      <p>"The dot for the I is always over the R," Wells said.</p>
      <p>The $2 bill was printed in 1986, which means Wells' mother signed it decades ago.</p>
      <p>"My best guess is that this happened between 1986 and 1995," Wells said.</p>
      <p>Discovering the signed bill has brought back a flood of memories.</p>
      <p>"She's been in my mind quite a bit the last couple of days," Wells said.</p>
      <p>And she's absolutely amazed that she found it -- or it found her.</p>
      <p>Wells is not sure why her mother signed the bill, but she's glad she did.</p>
      <p>It's a story to tell, a blast from the past, and a newly-found cherished memento.</p>
