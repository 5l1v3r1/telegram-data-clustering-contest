      <h3>Haaland father visits United training base</h3>
      <p>Sources at the <a href="https://theathletic.com/1387736/2019/11/18/live-qa-chat-football-with-david-ornstein-mon-18-nov-12pm-gmt-7am-et/?redirected=1">Athletic</a> claim the father of Red Bull Salzburg striker <b><a href="http://www.espnfc.com/player/_/id/253989/erling-haaland">Erling Haaland</a></b> has visited Manchester United's Carrington training base ahead of a potential move to Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>During a live Q&amp;A, Athletic journalist David Ornstein said Erling's dad Alf-Inge Haaland -- a former player for Nottingham Forest, Leeds United and Manchester City -- paid a recent visit to the base, fuelling speculation that his 19-year-old son favours a move to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side. That news comes hot off the back of word from ESPN FC sources that <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/football/manchester-united/story/3990703/sources-manchester-united-to-make-enquiry-over-haaland-availability-in-january">United are preparing to open up talks with Haaland's club Salzburg</a> in January.</p>
      <p>Haaland junior is at the top of a number of New Year shopping lists after a dazzling run of form in the Champions League saw him become the first ever player to score in each of their first four games in the competition. The 19-year-old has scored 15 goals in 12 games for the Austrian giants since joining them from Molde -- the club Solskjaer managed before Man United.</p>

      <h3>Juventus plot €100 million summer splurge</h3>
      <p>Serie A leaders Juventus are making plans ahead of a busy summer, and reports at <a href="https://www.calciomercato.com/news/juve-piu-di-100-milioni-per-due-talenti-italiani-74811">Calciomercato</a> claims Maurizio Sarri's side are set to spend more than €100 million to land Brescia midfielder <b><a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/261047/Sandro-Tonali">Sandro Tonali</a></b> and <b><a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/234306/Federico-Chiesa">Federico Chiesa</a></b> of Fiorentina.</p>
      <p>Tonali, 19, has impressed Juve scouts in his debut season in Serie A after winning promotion with Brescia last year, and has also reportedly attracted interest from Manchester United, but the midfielder is believed to favour a domestic switch. It is believed a fee of around €40m has been pencilled into the Juventus summer budget for youngster's signing.</p>
      <p>Winger Chiesa, meanwhile, is likely to cost substantially more, with Fiorentina valuing the 22-year-old in the region of €70m, but Juve chiefs are confident they can do a deal for a player who will have just two years remaining on his contract at the end of the current season.</p>
      <h3>Red Devils to seal cut-price Bruno bargain</h3>
      <p>Manchester United could be set to clinch a bargain £65 million deal to sign Sporting Lisbon midfielder <b><a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/124091/Bruno-Fernandes">Bruno Fernandes</a></b>, according to reports at Portuguese outlet <a href="https://www.ojogo.pt/futebol/1a-liga/sporting/noticias/sporting-tem-dividas-e-precisa-de-65-milhoes-de-euros-ate-janeiro-11524268.html?target=conteudo_fechado">O Jogo</a>.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese giants reportedly require around £57m to pay off outstanding debts, and selling 25-year-old Fernandes would put them in the black, while also adding some funds to their transfer kitty for a potential replacement.</p>
      <p>Fernandes has been a target for United for some time, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer seeing the Portugal international as a long-term replacement for the now departed <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/131481/Ander-Herrera">Ander Herrera</a>.</p>
      <p>Tottenham Hotspur, meanwhile, are also believed to be interested in the playmaker, and believe the former Udinese man is the ideal player to fill the void that could be left by the potential departure of <b><a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/144130/Christian-Eriksen">Christian Eriksen</a></b>, should the Dane depart north London for Real Madrid.</p>
      <h3>Tap-ins</h3>
      <p>- West Ham will set their sights on former Newcastle and Liverpool manager Rafa Benitez if they decide to part company with under-fire boss Manuel Pellegrini, according to reports at the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/west-ham-monitor-rafa-benitez-20910081">Mirror</a>. The 59-year-old Spaniard is currently plying his trade at Chinese Super League side Dalian Yifang, but would be open to a move back to England.</p>
      <p>- Sources at <a href="https://www.footballinsider247.com/exclusive-arsenal-on-tuesday-transfer-mission-for-player-lined-up-to-replace-xhaka/">Football Insider</a> claim Arsenal have sent scouts to watch Hungary midfielder <b><a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/257206/Dominik-Szoboszlai">Dominik Szoboszlai</a></b> during the international break. The 19-year-old is set to start for his country in the crunch Euro 2020 qualifier against Wales on Tuesday, and the Red Bull Salzburg man has been touted as a replacement for the potentially outgoing <b><a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/149981/Granit-Xhaka">Granit Xhaka</a></b>.</p>
      <p>- Former Liverpool and Sunderland striker <b><a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/140931/Fabio-Borini">Fabio Borini</a></b> looks set to leave AC Milan in the January transfer window, and <a href="https://www.calciomercato.com/news/borini-proposto-al-torino-ecco-la-risposta-dei-granata-al-milan-81111">Calciomercato</a> claims the forward has been offered for fellow Serie A side Torino.
