      <p>French sustainable power plant operator Neoen SA announced on Tuesday a 50% expansion of its Hornsdale Power Reserve in South Australia, the world’s largest lithium ion battery project, in conjunction with Tesla Inc .</p>
      <p>The South Australian government will also support the project with up to A$50 million ($33.95 million) and A$8 million ($5.43 million) in funding through the Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), the office of The Minister For Energy and Emissions Reduction said in a statement sent to Reuters.</p>
      <p>The battery project was set up around summertime 2017 in Australia to support the country’s shaky power grid which is further stressed by increased demand during the heat. The project was a promise by Tesla’s Elon Musk to build it in 100 days or give it free. ($1 = 1.4730 Australian dollars) (Reporting by Ambar Warrick in Bengaluru; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)</p>
