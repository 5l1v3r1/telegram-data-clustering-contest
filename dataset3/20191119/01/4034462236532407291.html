      <h1>BMW i7 Prepares To Battle Mercedes EQS</h1>
      <h2>Here’s your first look at BMW’s upcoming electric 7 Series.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T01:15:53+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 01:15</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Bigg</a></address>
      <p>With its promising specifications, the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/bmw-i4-will-be-a-serious-threat-to-the-tesla-model-3">BMW i4 is shaping up to be a serious threat</a> to the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/tesla/model-3">Tesla Model 3</a>. However, the i4 is just part of BMW's upcoming EV onslaught. So far, BMW has confirmed the iNext and <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/bmw/ix3">iX3</a> electric SUVs will be joining the lineup.</p>
      <p>But thanks to these new spy shots, we now know that BMW is also preparing a fully electric version of the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/bmw/7-series">7 Series</a> to fight the Mercedes EQS, which will essentially be an electric <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/mercedes-benz/s-class">S-Class</a>. What we don't know, however, is whether the production version will use the same body as the prototype seen here for the first time or if this a test mule being used to develop the technology.</p>

      <p>How do we know this is a fully electric BMW 7 Series? The "electric test vehicle" sticker on the side is an obvious giveaway. At first glance, the prototype looks like a regular 7 Series, but the headlights and rear lights are covered with camouflage. This suggests the graphics could change to differentiate the i7 from the regular 7 Series. The i7 is expected to form part of the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/big-changes-are-coming-for-the-bmw-7-series">next-generation BMW 7 Series lineup</a>, which will also include a regular combustion model and a plug-in hybrid.</p>

      <p>According to reports, the entry-level i7 will be offered with an 80 kWh battery pack to match the i4, while the range-topping version could have a capacity higher than 120 kWh.</p>
      <p>With its largest battery pack, the electric 7 Series could potentially travel 435 miles on a single charge. Rumors also suggest there will be two variants: an i7 and i7S, with the range-topping model rumored to produce over 650 horsepower. This would make it one of the most powerful BMW models yet. The next-generation BMW 7 Series is expected to arrive in late 2021 or early 2022, so the i7 isn't likely to debut until 2022 at the earliest.</p>
