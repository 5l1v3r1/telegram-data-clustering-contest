      <p>Greek kiwi fruit has found a new export market after Thailand’s Agriculture Ministry on Monday approved its importation into the country.</p>
      <p>The approval came after a four-day inspection by Thai government officials who toured kiwi plantations in Northern Greece, including facilities where the fruit was selected and packaged for shipping.</p>
      <p>The officials also paid a visit to the official phytosanitary services to confirm health requirements for import into Thailand.</p>
      <p>Inspections were carried out at Thessaloniki, Imathia and Pieria prefectures.</p>
      <p>Kiwi fruit or Chinese gooseberry might be known as the national fruit of New Zealand, but Greece is estimated to be the 3rd largest producer of the exotic fruit by the end of 2019 (from 4th place the previous year).</p>
      <p>According to data from the Hellenic Statistical Authority during the period 2017 – 2018, Greece exported 154,843 tonnes, produced 274,619 tonnes with 9,218 hectares of kiwi plants.</p>
      <p>Other countries that have started recently importing Greek kiwis include China, South Africa and the US while Vietnam, South Korea, Taiwan, and Brazil are among the emerging markets interested in kiwis.</p>
