      <p>Former Wallabies coach Alan Jones has called on Rugby Australia chairman Cameron Clyne to go immediately and leave key tasks like finding the next national coach to a new-look board.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p53bis.html">Clyne announced on Monday he won't stand for re-election</a> at the completion of his difficult term in March.</p>

      <p>He said he and the board remained committed to delivering a new broadcast deal, appointing Michael Cheika's replacement as Wallabies coach and concluding the legal matter involving Israel Folau.</p>
      <p>Jones has been an outspoken critic of Clyne's tenure, which has been shadowed by the removal of Western Force from Super Rugby, the Folau saga and disappointing results from the Wallabies.</p>

      <p>"Go now and take the board with you," Jones said on 2GB on Tuesday. "Let Australian rugby make a fresh start and no appointments should be made, coach or anybody, until a new administration is in place.</p>
      <p>"This mob are lame ducks but they're going to lumber the next administration with whatever the lame ducks leave behind."</p>
