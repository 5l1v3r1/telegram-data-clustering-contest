        <i>Fuller says he’s ‘disappointed’ with the way powers were used but young people should have ‘a little bit of fear’ of police</i>
      </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/new-south-wales">New South Wales</a> police commissioner, Mick Fuller, says he was “disappointed” by the conduct of officers who strip-searched a 16-year-old girl at a music festival in 2018 but has again stood by the use of the controversial police power.</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/breakfast/mick-fuller-on-dating-apps,-strip-searches/11716644">an interview with the ABC on Tuesday</a> Fuller conceded revelations in the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission (Lecc) hearings last month which revealed an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/oct/21/police-strip-searched-16-year-old-girl-at-splendour-music-festival-inquiry-hears">allegedly illegal search of a 16-year-old girl at the 2018 Splendour in the Grass festival</a> “doesn’t make me happy”.</p>
      <p>After a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/aug/22/extraordinary-rise-in-strip-searches-by-nsw-police-fuelled-by-use-of-sniffer-dogs">dramatic rise in the number of strip-searches conducted by police over the past decade</a>, Fuller said the rate of strip-searches was declining across the state as pressure mounts on the use of the practice.</p>
      <p>“There’s certainly been a couple of examples recently from the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission where I was disappointed with the way the powers were used and I’m conducting a personal review into strip-searches to make sure the safeguards are being applied,” he said.</p>
      <p>“But again they’re not being done in huge numbers compared to [other] police powers but at the same time I accept that there is concern around strip-searches and I’m taking that seriously.”</p>
      <p>Fuller has taken the unusual step of publicly advocating for the use of strip-search powers in the wake of high-profile criticism, saying in a separate interview on Monday that young people should have “a little bit of fear” of police and that questioning “the legitimacy of policing” had “a negative impact on public safety”.</p>
      <p>He also claimed reducing strip-searches could lead to an increase in knife crime <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/18/nsw-police-commissioner-misleading-for-linking-strip-searches-to-knife">despite fewer than 1% of all searches in the state being conducted for that reason</a>.</p>
      <p>Asked about that on Tuesday, Fuller said he had not “been able to test” that data – contained in a landmark report from the Redfern Legal Centre and the University of NSW – but again insisted he was concerned about knife crime.</p>
      <p>In October the Lecc held public hearings into a potentially illegal search which left a 16-year-old girl fearful and in tears. The police watchdog is also considering the use of the search powers more broadly, including whether police are allowed to force people to squat.</p>
      <p>This month, the NSW deputy coroner Harriet Grahame released the findingsof an inquest into festival deaths <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/10/devastating-the-drug-inquest-findings-that-condemn-wholesale-strip-searches">which recommended police dramatically limit </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/10/devastating-the-drug-inquest-findings-that-condemn-wholesale-strip-searches">strip searches</a>, saying the wholesale use of the practice was of “grave concern”.</p>
      <p>But despite saying police were reviewing the use of the power, Fuller defended the high-profile policing tactics at music festivals which critics, including the coroner, say can increase drug-related harm.</p>
      <p>“Drugs are still illegal,” Fuller said on Tuesday. I know there seems to be a romantic feeling about ecstasy, that it’s a party drug, but it’s killing people, we know drugs are dangerous, we know there’s no safe amount of MDMA.</p>
      <p>“We know drugs are consumed in large quantities at music festivals. Now, if that happened at your local pub or club or restaurant … you wouldn’t go there but for some reason we just accept that music festivals are lawless and that’s OK.</p>
      <p>“I don’t get why we accept the behaviour at music festival as different to every other licensed premises in NSW, I don’t get it.”</p>
      <p>Also on Tuesday, Fuller announced police would conduct an investigation into whether dating apps are being used by sex offenders to target victims.</p>
      <p>Despite saying he did not have data on whether it was an issue, Fuller said he believed it was a problem.</p>
      <p>“The concern for me is one, there’s two particular crimes types at the moment that are increasing and one is fraud, particularly technology-enabled fraud, and the second one is adult sexual assault,” he said.</p>
      <p>“If you think about most crimes, stealing vehicles, breaking into houses, we pick up quite easily recidivist offenders [but] when it comes to adult sexual assault we’re not seeing any stats around recidivist offenders.</p>
      <p>“That for me means I’m concerned we’re not getting the information we need to protect the next victim.”</p>
