      <h1>Chadwick Boseman Shares His Hopes For Black Panther 2</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T01:51:24+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 01:51</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Workman</a></address>
      <p>Even though <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/black-panther-2"><b>Black Panther 2</b></a> is a few years away, Chadwick Boseman is hopeful for what writer and director Ryan Coogler can do with it. In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPXFvAZKToc">MTV International</a>, Boseman explained what he wants to see in the sequel.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully we can maintain the foundation that we sort of set and build upon it and expand it and explore it. That’s what I hope,” said Boseman. “But I think first you have to maintain the foundation. We built a culture and a world, so you have to make sure that you keep that in place.”</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, Coogler spoke with <a href="https://comicbook.com/marvel/2018/11/06/black-panther-2-ryan-coogler-approach/">IndieWire</a> earlier this month about his expectations for <b>Black Panther 2</b>.</p>
      <p>“I think the pressure is kind of always going to be there,” said Coogler. “I’ve had a chance to make three feature films, each one of them had its own very specific type of pressure. In the process of it, it feels insurmountable each time.”</p>

      <p>“When it comes to making a sequel, I’ve never done it before, a sequel to something that I’ve directed myself,” added Coogler. “So I think there’s gonna be a lot of pressure there, but what we’re going to try to do is just focus on the work, like we always do. Really try to go step by step and try to quiet everything else around us, really focus on trying to make something that has some type of meaning.”</p>
      <p>Fortunately, Marvel Studios’ Kevin Feige <a href="https://ew.com/movies/2018/03/09/marvel-studios-kevin-feige-mcu-future/">said earlier this year</a> that the studio knows “where we want to head with the second one.”</p>
      <p><b>Black Panther 2</b> will hit theaters on May 6, 2022.</p>
