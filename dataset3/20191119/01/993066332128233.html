      <p>FAILURE to monitor Northern Ireland estuaries in a "robust scientific way" has led to fears the Environment Agency may be reducing its wetlands sampling "to avoid scrutiny".</p>
      <p>A UK report submitted to the European Commission as part of its EU Habitats Directive obligations reveals Foyle Harbour &amp; Faughan, Lagan and Newry estuaries were "failing" under the Water Framework Directive (WFD).</p>
      <p>The Bann "was classified as having poor rcological potential which again means it's failing".</p>
      <p>The report notes: "After reviewing annual WFD classification in NI Estuaries since the last reporting cycle there has been no change in their WFD classification status as Moderate-Poor Ecological Potential indicating little likelihood of change (ie stable) despite the management measures put in place for improvement".</p>
      <p>Among the threats to the ecosystems given are "pest control methods in agriculture", specifically the exceeding of the approved threshold concentration of Cypermethrin, a biocide found in sheep dip which is classified as a "priority hazardous substances" under the WFD.</p>
      <p>It also cites the "development and operation of energy production plants (including bioenergy plants, fossil and nuclear energy plants)", singling out Coolkeeragh power station which falls within Foyle Harbour and Faughan Estuary.</p>
      <p>However, the document notes "a high level of uncertainty in the confidence" of the level of the breaches "due to the low numbers of samples available to calculate the annual average".</p>
      <p>James Orr, director of Friends of the Earth NI, said the fact there is not enough monitoring throws up serious questions.</p>
      <p>"The evidence may even be a lot worse because the report also highlights the fact that we are not monitoring these sites in a robust scientific way," he said.</p>
      <p>"The frequency of the samples is not good enough, a fact admitted by the report itself. It seems that the government may even be reducing the monitoring to these wetlands to avoid scrutiny."</p>
      <p>He said the Bann, Foyle &amp; Faughan, Belfast Lough and Newry now have "too high levels of nutrients and hazardous chemicals to sustain healthy living ecosystems".</p>
      <p>"The fact that all of the estuaries are failing to meet good ecological condition is a terrible reflection on how we manage our coastline and our rivers.</p>
      <p>"These places are vitally important for fish, mammal, seabird and overwintering wildfowl and we are seeing clear evidence of a decline in these species."</p>
      <p>The Department for Agriculture, the Environment and Rural Affairs did not respond to calls for a comment last night.</p>
