      <h1>Nets’ worst-case Kyrie Irving shoulder scenario is lingering</h1>

      <p>The Nets knew they would likely go through this season experiencing life without Kevin Durant.</p>
      <p>Now they are learning <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/13/kyrie-irving-has-ominous-injury-as-nets-disaster-grows/">what life is like without Kyrie Irving,</a> even if they hope it’s just a “short-term” absence.</p>
      <p>The star point guard missed his second straight game Monday night because of a right shoulder impingement. As the Nets returned to their home court to face the Pacers after a 10-day, five-game road trip, they did so with Irving watching in street clothes.</p>
      <p>Irving has been getting treatment from the Nets’ performance staff, but his shoulder had not improved enough to play Monday night. Coach Kenny Atkinson was hopeful that the injury is not something he will have to manage all season.</p>
      <p>“I hope not,” Atkinson said before tipoff at Barclays Center. “I will say this — just from my personal opinion, shoulders are tough. Those aren’t easy to deal with. Probably everybody in this room, when you have a shoulder thing, it’s just not easy. Listen, I know he’s working diligently to get back on the court. I know he wants to be out on the court bad.</p>
      <p>“My hope is that it’s a short-term thing.”</p>
      <p>Irving initially sustained the injury last Tuesday against the Jazz, a game in which he shot a season-low 33.3 percent (10-for-30) from the field and missed 10 of 12 3s, including a potential game-winner with seven seconds left.</p>
      <p>Since then, Irving had been listed as questionable for each of the past three games. He played through the injury Thursday against the Nuggets, recording 17 points (on 8 of 20 shooting), nine assists and six rebounds. He said after the loss he was trying to manage the injury as best he could and it was no excuse for his poor shooting.</p>
      <p>But he was eventually declared out hours before tipoff against the Bulls and Pacers, as the Nets chose to err on the side of caution.</p>
      <p>“Hasn’t got to that point where he’s able to play with it,” Atkinson said.</p>
      <p>Atkinson called ruling Irving out Monday “a collaborative decision” among himself, Irving and the performance team.</p>

      <p>“That’s [the] conclusion we came to for tonight’s game,” he said. “Best that he didn’t play.”</p>
      <p>After signing a max contract worth four years and $141 million in July, Irving is averaging 28.5 points, 7.2 assists and 5.4 rebounds while shooting 44.4 percent from the floor and 34.1 percent from deep in 11 games.</p>
      <p>The Nets were <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/12/caris-levert-ruled-out-for-nets-as-injury-watch-begins/">already trying to make do without Caris LeVert</a>, who underwent surgery on Thursday to repair ligaments in his right thumb. The guard is expected to be out around five weeks.</p>
      <p>With Irving and LeVert missing Saturday night against the Bulls, the Nets leaned on Spencer Dinwiddie to pick up the critical win while Garrett Temple and Theo Pinson also stepped up to play important roles.</p>
      <p>“I think that group that was out there in Chicago, that’s the great thing about continuity,” Atkinson said. “I think if you had someone else besides Spencer or a new guy, that would have been tough. But the fact that those guys that were out there — throw Theo in that group, even [Dzanan] Musa — that’s been playing in the system, I do think they go on autopilot, and I thought Spencer did a fabulous job. Again, he’s got a lot of corporate knowledge, been here a long time. It gives you more comfort, even coming into [Monday’s] game. Those guys know what the heck they’re doing.”</p>
