      <p>Coleraine hurler Ciaran Lagan played a captain's role in his side's 1-16 to 0-11 win over Newry Shamrocks at Dungannon Hurling Club's ground.</p>
      <p>For the second time in three years, the Coleraine men move on to the All-Ireland series, and the corner back is confident they can make a strong bid to add a national title to their Derry and Ulster crowns.</p>
      <p>In 2016, they reached the All-Ireland final, losing out by two points to Glenmore of Kilkenny at Croke Park, a game the Eoghan Rua skipper feels they should have won.</p>
      <p>“We'll go on and give it a lash, and hopefully we can do a wee bit better than we did last time,'' he said.</p>
      <p>“I know people will say, take one game at a time, but I don't see why we can't go on and do it.</p>
      <p>“We got beaten by a very good Kilkenny team last time. We started too slow, but it was a game we could have won.”</p>
      <p>Sean Leo McGoldrick's 11 points and a late goal from teenager Dara Mooney carried Eoghan Rua to an eight-point success in the provincial decider.</p>
      <p>McGoldrick, one of six brothers in the team, delivered yet another classy display of clinical finishing.</p>
      <p>“He was very good again, and you could say that about him in every game, to be honest,” said Lagan.</p>
      <p>It was the Down champions who made the early running, but the men from the north-west gradually got to the pace of the game.</p>
      <p>And Coleraine needed a volley of scores late in the first half to give themselves some breathing space with a four points interval lead.</p>
      <p>“It took us a while to get out of the traps, Newry were working very hard, getting every break, and they worked a lot harder than us in the first 15 or 20 minutes,'' stated Lagan.</p>
      <p>“But near the end of the half we got three or four points in a row and went four or five up at half-time. That was because we were getting the work rate up.”</p>
      <p>Shamrocks lost centre forward Eoin McGuinness to a second yellow card early in the second half, but responded strongly to the setback as they took the game to the pre-match favourites.</p>
      <p>They were just three points behind heading into the final five minutes, but Eoghan Rua closed out the game with a determined finish.</p>
      <p>“Losing a man in the second half seemed to give them a bit of extra life,'' added Lagan.</p>
      <p>“They got better and we just went into our shells.</p>
      <p>“They're a very good hurling team. no disrespect to teams we have played already, but this was our toughest game, we needed everyone to give us everything.</p>
      <p>“Tomas Magee had a brilliant game and the young boys inside, Dara Mooney and Dara McGoldrick, were all excellent.”</p>
