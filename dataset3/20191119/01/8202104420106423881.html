      <h3>Saskatoon cyclists could soon be required to provide a one-metre buffer when passing pedestrians under a slate of new rules.</h3>
      <p>City council approved in principle changes to the city’s existing cycling bylaw at Monday’s meeting, including requiring a one-metre buffer between cyclists and motor vehicles and permitting children under 14 to ride on sidewalks.</p>
      <p>Coun. Randy Donauer proposed the one-metre pedestrian-cyclist buffer, saying residents have complained about being startled by cyclists passing them on the Meewasin Trail.</p>
      <p>“Sometimes a shouting match ensues and vulgarity is exchanged,” Donauer said.</p>
      <p>How a buffer would work remains to be seen, but Donauer said he kept his proposal vague so issues like narrow trails that lack sufficient room for a one-metre buffer could be addressed.</p>
      <p>Coun. Darren Hill added that he has also heard from residents who have been startled by cyclists passing them while they were walking.</p>
      <p>Council voted 9-2 in favour of that idea; Coun. Sarina Gersher and Coun. Mairin Loewen voted against it.</p>
      <p>Marina Melchiorre, a senior transportation engineer with the city, told council she had not come across another city with such a pedestrian-cyclist buffer in her research drafting the proposals.</p>
      <p>Loewen added that the number of pedestrians wearing earbuds and who fail to hear a cyclist approaching plays a role in these interactions.</p>
      <p>Council also voted 7-4 against a proposal to remove a requirement that cyclists use protected bike lanes on streets where they are available. Gersher, Loewen, Coun. Hilary Gough and Mayor Charlie Clark voted in favour of removing the requirement.</p>
      <p>Although council unanimously approved most of the new cycling rules, a study of prohibiting youth from riding on sidewalks in business improvement districts and industrial areas was backed by an 8-3 margin.</p>
      <p>“We need to make sure we’re looking after pedestrians, as well,” Hill said.</p>
      <p>Gersher, Gough and Loewen voted against the study.</p>
      <p>Loewen said she would rather see youth riding carefully on sidewalks in busy business districts than on the streets.</p>
      <p>“The sidewalks are already too small on 20th Street West,” Randy Pshebylo, executive director of the Riversdale Business Improvement District, told council. Pshebylo had already expressed concerns about the rule allowing youth to cycle on sidewalks after two pedestrians were injured after leaving businesses on 20th.</p>
      <p>Pshebylo wondered about lowering the speed limit on 20th Street to 30 kilometres per hour.</p>
      <p>The rule changes include requiring cyclists to use hand signals, but do not include mandatory helmet use. The city administration will now draft a revamped bylaw based on the approved changes.</p>
