      <p>Two days after a video surfaced showing official vehicle of Hapur Mandi Samiti secretary running over vegetables of vendors, the government on Monday stripped the official of his responsibilities with immediate effect and sent him to Rajya Krishi Utpadan Mandi Parishad in Lucknow.</p>
      <p>The vehicle of <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/sushil-kumar">Sushil Kumar</a> had crushed vegetables during an encroachment drive outside Naveen Mandi premises in Hapur district around 10.30 am on Saturday. However, the video does not show him seated inside the car, which was driven by his driver. Some vendors are seen pleading with an unidentified official.</p>
      <p>“The conduct of the officer is insensitive and the act has denigrated the image of the government in the eyes of the people. The manner in which the action was taken could have led to the loss of lives,” Jitendra Pratap Singh, director of Mandi Parishad, wrote to DM Aditi Singh. On Saturday, the DM ordered an inquiry. “There is no doubt that vegetable vendors at Naveen Mandi have encroached the area and this leads to traffic congestion in the morning. However, the action, as seen the video, is highly deplorable as there are many other ways to deal with the menace of encroachment,” said ADM Jaynath Yadav.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Vegetable Vendors’ Association alleged that they have been facing high-handedness by Mandi Samiti officials and lodged complaints on several occasions, but to no avail. “This is for the first time that action has been taken against them,” said Brijesh Tyagi, president of the association.</p>
