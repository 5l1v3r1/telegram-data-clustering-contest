        <li>South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem launched a $449,000 anti-meth ad campaign on Monday with the tagline: "Meth. We're on it." She cited that the state's meth crisis is "growing at an alarming rate," the governor said in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HU_ysMkOYgc&amp;feature=youtu.be">campaign launch video</a>.</li>
        <li>People on Twitter were quick to react to the campaign's ambiguous slogan, with many ridiculing the campaign, noting that it insinuates that the whole state is on the drug.</li>
        <li>On the other hand, some have defended the campaign, as it accomplished its purpose of raising awareness for the meth crisis. The campaign became a trending topic on Twitter shortly after it was launched.</li>

      <p>South Dakota sparked a wave of mixed reactions when it launched an anti-meth campaign with a simple four-word logo: "Meth. We're on it." </p>
      <p>Governor Kristi Noem announced the $449,000 campaign on Monday, saying in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HU_ysMkOYgc&amp;feature=youtu.be">campaign launch video</a> that South Dakota's meth crisis is "growing at an alarming rate."</p>
      <p>"It impacts every community in our state, and it threatens the success of the next generation," she continued in the video. "This is our problem, and together, we need to get on it. Let's get meth out of South Dakota."</p>
      <p>However, people on Twitter were quick to react to the campaign's ambiguous slogan. Most responses have ridiculed the campaign, noting that it insinuates that the whole state is on the drug.</p>

      <p>"I'm so glad South Dakota used my 2018 tax dollars to tell the country I'm on meth," one Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/TheDreamGhoul/status/1196565372897546245">wrote</a>.</p>
      <p>"Did the state of South Dakota need to trademark 'Meth. We're on it,'" another person <a href="https://twitter.com/dawashington/status/1196511476258922499?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1196511476258922499&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.argusleader.com%2Fstory%2Fnews%2F2019%2F11%2F18%2Fsouth-dakota-meth-twitter-reacts-gov-kristi-noem-meth-were-it-campaign%2F4231529002%2F">responded</a> to the campaign. "Like, they thought someone was going to try and steal it?"</p>
      <p>On the other hand, some have defended the campaign, as it accomplished its purpose of raising awareness for the meth crisis. The campaign became a trending topic on Twitter shortly after it was launched.</p>
      <p>"I hope you've all figured out that South Dakota's ad agency knows exactly what it's doing and you're giving them the attention they wanted?" <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidLJarman/status/1196543691101364224">one person wrote on Twitter</a>. "If their slogan had been of the 'Don't do meth; it's bad for you' ... literally no one would be aware of SD's anti-meth campaign today."</p>
      <p>Noem clarified the meaning of the campaign in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/govnoem/videos/496384087625269/">Facebook live video</a> when it launched, saying that it is "going to be about solutions and hope, and how every single one of us in South Dakota can partner to be on meth."</p>
      <p>"Really, the tagline is 'I'm on meth,' and what it's talking about is that each one of us, no matter who we are, that we're on the case of meth," Noem said in the video, "that we're protecting our family, we're protecting our friends, we're protecting our communities from this epidemic we see."</p>
      <p>"We're all going to be taking some responsibility in battling it and making sure that it's not going to have a place in our state in the future," she said.</p>
