      <h1>Injury Update For Kansas City Chiefs WR Tyreek Hill</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T01:39:20+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 01:39</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p><b>Earlier</b>: Tyreek Hill has already missed time this season with a sternoclavicular injury, and the speedy wide receiver came up lame again on the Chiefs’ first possession tonight.</p>
      <p>After the final play of Kansas City’s first series against the Los Angeles Chargers in Mexico, Hill came up limping on his way to the sideline. His right hamstring seems to be the problem.</p>
      <p>As of now, it’s unclear if he suffered a strain of some kind or simply cramped up.</p>

      <p>Chiefs fans have to be concerned about Hill. He missed several games earlier in the season and was also banged up during last week’s loss to the Tennessee Titans.</p>
      <p>We’ll see if Hill returns to the field when Kansas City gets the ball back. Meanwhile, Los Angeles leads 3-0 and is driving late in the first quarter.</p>

      <p><b>Update</b>: As the Chiefs took the field for their second offensive possession, Hill went into the locker room.</p>

      <p>Certainly not a great sign for his availability the rest of the evening. We’ll keep you posted.</p>
