      <p>We had heard whispers, and it turns out the rumors were true – game developer Valve is set to release Half-Life: Alyx.</p>
      <p>In a tweet from the official Valve Twitter account, the company described the upcoming release as its “flagship VR game”.</p>

      <p>So far, information about the new game is scant, but Valve will unveil further details about Half-Life: Alyx this Thursday, November 21 at 10am PT (6pm GMT / Friday, November 22 at 5am AEDT).</p>
      <p>Those familiar with the Half-Life series may recognize the name Alyx from the game’s universe.</p>
      <p>Alyx Vance is a young woman and prominent character who first appeared in Half-Life 2, where she was a major player in the human resistance against the Combine – and a close friend of the game’s main protagonist, Gordon Freeman.</p>

      <p>Talk of a new Half-Life title kicked off when an alleged interview transcript between Valve executives was leaked online.</p>
      <p>A quote from the leaked transcript credits a ‘Geoff’ – believed to be games broadcaster Geoff Keighley – as stating: "March 2020, 'Half-Life: Alyx' comin' out."</p>
      <p>The same transcript also suggested the VR game would be revealed at The Game Awards on December 12 – however Valve’s new tweet suggests it may be unveiled much sooner than anticipated.</p>
      <p>The announcement of a ‘flagship’ VR game follows Valve’s release of its own dedicated VR headset – the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/valve-index">Valve Index</a> – earlier this year.</p>
      <p>When the Index was first announced, the company stated it would be releasing a flagship VR game before the end of the year – and it certainly seems like Half-Life: Alyx is it. Whatever the case, we’ll know more this Thursday.</p>
