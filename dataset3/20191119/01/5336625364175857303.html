      <h1>Valve announces 'Half-Life: Alyx', a VR game that is not 'Half-Life 3'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T01:13:36+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 01:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mashable.com/author/amanda-yeo/" target="_blank">Amanda Yeo</a></address>
      <p>Grab a jacket if you're heading to Hell, because Valve is making Half-Life games again! Don't get too excited though — it isn't <i>Half-Life 3</i>.</p>
      <p>In the first post to Valve's verified Twitter account, the developer announced today that it will reveal a new game in the much-loved Half-Life series later this week: VR title <i>Half-Life: Alyx</i>.</p>
      <p>"We're excited to unveil <i>Half-Life: Alyx</i>, our flagship VR game, this Thursday at 10am Pacific Time," said the tweet. "Can't wait to share it with all of you!"</p>
      <p>Many fans can't wait to hear more about it either. Debuting with <i>Half-Life </i>in 1998, the video game franchise has maintained a massive and persistent fanbase despite its last game being released over a decade ago.</p>
      <p>Fervent believers have searched for any sign that <i>Half-Life 3</i> may be coming in the intervening years, desperately clinging to rumors and hope. <i>Half-Life 3</i> is essentially the <i>Winds of Winter</i> of video games, only instead of George R.R. Martin promising that he's definitely working on it, we have only tumbleweeds and dreams. </p>

      <p>Valve's new VR game may not be that elusive gaming Sasquatch, but it is an indication the Half-Life series is still breathing. </p>
      <p>We'll have to wait until Thursday for further details on <i>Half-Life: Alyx</i>, but we can already draw a few deductions from the title. 'Alyx' is presumably a reference to Alyx Vance, a friend and companion to the protagonist Gordon Freeman in the previous Half-Life games. </p>
      <p>Alyx was very well received at the time, and is still held up as an exemplar of non-playable companions in video games. It'll be interesting to revisit her now, particularly considering how much games and gamers' expectations have changed since we last saw her.</p>
      <p>However, the fact that <i>Half-Life: Alyx </i>is a VR game has put a damper on some fans' enthusiasm. VR sets are expensive, not to mention the rigs required to run them. This combined with a relative lack of games has made VR a poor investment for many gamers, which could make the new Half-Life inaccessible to them.</p>

      <p><i>Half-Life: Alyx</i> isn't exactly the Half-Life continuation that players have been howling about for over a decade. Even so, any sniff of a return to Gordon Freeman's universe is bound to excite fans. At least it's something to tide us over while Valve learns to count to three.</p>
