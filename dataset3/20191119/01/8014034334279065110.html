      <p>SAN DIEGO — Court records say a San Diego man who shot his estranged wife and three sons to death before taking his own life had sent the woman a photo of a handgun and the warning: “it’s sure happening.”</p>
      <p>Police on Monday said 31-year-old Jose Valdivia killed 29-year-old Sabrina Rosario during an argument Saturday — one day after she’d obtained a restraining order against him.</p>
      <p>Police say he also killed 3-year-old Enzi Valdivia; 5-year-old Zuriel Valdivia and 11-year-old Zeth Valdivia.</p>
      <p>Nine-year-old Ezekiel Valdivia remains on life-support.</p>
      <p>The couple were in the midst of a divorce.</p>
      <p>KFMB-TV says Rosario filed court documents saying Valdivia had repeatedly threatened and harassed her and showed up at the Paradise Hills home unannounced.</p>
      <p>Documents say he sent the threatening handgun photo on Nov. 6 — 10 days before the murder-suicide.</p>
