      <p>A man recently arrested by Penticton RCMP for shoplifting has died in custody and now the province's police watchdog has begun an investigation.</p>
      <p>The Independent Investigations Office of B.C. announced today, Nov. 18, it is investigating after a suspected shoplifter died in hospital.</p>
      <p>The man was arrested by Penticton RCMP on the morning of Nov. 8 following a theft from a store in Penticton, according to an Independent Investigations Office media release. The unidentified man resisted arrest, sustaining a minor head injury and was taken to hospital. The suspect later left the hospital and had to be returned later by police.</p>
      <p>The man was admitted to hospital again where his condition deteriorated. He died six days later on Nov. 14.</p>
      <p>The B.C. Coroners Service is also investigating to determine "how, where, when and by what means he came to his death," the investigations office says.</p>
      <p>The IIO investigation will determine what role, if any, the officers' actions or inactions may have played in the man's death.</p>
      <p>The IIO looks into officer-related incidents that result in serious harm or death.</p>
