      <p>All three major networks ignored House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy sending a letter to ABC News demanding they answer reports that they spiked a story about Jeffrey Epstein three years ago.</p>
      <p>"All three morning shows on Monday ignored the move by Congress to investigate ABC covering up the networkâ€™s burying of the Jeffrey Epstein story back in 2016," the Media Research Center <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/morning-shows-skip-house-republicans-urging-abc-to-explain-why-it-spiked-jeffrey-epstein-story">said</a> Monday.</p>
      <p>This comes after <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/house-minority-leader-demands-answers-from-abc-news-on-epstein-story-megyn-kelly-says">McCarthy sent a letter to ABC News</a> on Sunday with six questions regarding video that had surfaced of ABC News anchor Amy Robach saying her network had spiked the Epstein story.</p>
      <p>Robach had said in a leaked video from earlier this month that <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/i-had-it-all-abc-host-claims-network-squashed-epstein-story-three-years-ago-in-leaked-video">she "had it all" regarding</a> Epstein. "It was unbelievable what we had. Clinton, we had everything," she said. "I tried for three years to get it on to no avail. And now it's all coming out, and it's like these new revelations, and I freaking had all of it."</p>
      <p>After news broke, <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/abc-news-whistleblower-ashley-bianco-fired-from-cbs-news-for-accessing-the-video">CBS News fired the ABC producer</a> who had created the clip, although the person who leaked it is still anonymous and is reportedly <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/im-not-the-whistleblower-the-leaker-is-still-inside-fired-cbs-news-staffer-denies-leaking-abc-news-epstein-footage">still working for ABC News</a>.</p>
