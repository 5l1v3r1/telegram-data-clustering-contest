      <p>Moree residents and visitors are encouraged to shop locally this Christmas, now more than ever as the drought takes its toll on local businesses.</p>
      <p>Coinciding with the <a href="https://www.moreechampion.com.au/story/6477625/share-the-love-and-support-local-businesses-this-christmas-with-new-gift-card/">newly-launched Love Local Moree gift card</a> and the <a href="https://www.moreechampion.com.au/story/6461747/buy-from-bush-push-to-change-rural-lives/">#buyfromthebush</a> and <a href="https://www.moreechampion.com.au/story/6495050/help-heal-wounds-with-power-of-purchase/?cs=13315">G</a><a href="https://www.moreechampion.com.au/story/6379595/go-country-for-christmas-shopping-senator/">o Country for Christmas</a> campaigns, comes Moree's very own Shop #mymoree promotion, which focusses on the unique and boutique retailers in the CBD.</p>
      <p>Developed by the Moree Chamber of Commerce, the Shop #mymoree promotion is a handy pocket guide for both residents and visitors to explore the local shopping precinct.</p>
      <p>Moree Chamber of Commerce chairperson and local retailer Dibs Cush said it was so important to recognise the unique shopping opportunities within our town, and to support them wherever possible.</p>
      <p>"We are truly blessed to have a wide variety of independent specialist retailers here in Moree," she said.</p>
      <p>"It's no surprise that things have been particularly tough this year so anything we can do to promote and support the retail precinct is welcomed."</p>
      <p>Funded by Moree Plains Shire Council through the Renew Moree Program, the guide includes details of 19 'unique and boutique' businesses in the CBD.</p>
      <p>It utilises the talents of local photographer Danni MacCue, was printed by local printer Simply Print Anything and features many familiar, local faces as models.</p>
      <p>"The Shop #mymoree brochure is all about supporting local," Mrs Cush said.</p>
      <p>"We wanted the guide to be something you pick up and keep in your handbag as a reference, you can get pretty much everything you need here in Moree, and if you can't find it ... just ask!"</p>
      <p>The Shop #mymoree guide will be available at a variety of places around Moree including the Tourist Information Centre, Moree Artesian Aquatic Centre, Moree Community Library, medical centres and a majority of motels.</p>
      <p>This Christmas, Mrs Cush encourages everyone to choose to support local and love local by shopping locally.</p>
      <p>As part of the shop local campaign, Moree Chamber of Commerce has this year organised four late night shopping evenings in the lead-up to Christmas.</p>
      <p>Many of the stores in the CBD will remain open late for the four consecutive Thursday nights - November 28, December 5, 12 and 19 - before Christmas, with entertainment by local musicians including Moree Ukulele Group, Moree Caledonian Society Pipes and Drums, Serendipity singers, a flute group, Jacqualyn Drenkhahn and Nicola Long.</p>
