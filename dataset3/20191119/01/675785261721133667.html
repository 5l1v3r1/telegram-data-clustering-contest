      <h2>Skylar Richardson, from Ohio, in the US gave birth to her stillborn daughter the day after she went to prom - prompting her to bury the baby in a shallow grave in the back garden</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T01:37:43+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 01:37</time> by <a rel="author">Milo Boyd, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/milo-boyd/</a></address>
      <p>A teenager who buried her stillborn baby in a shallow grave wishes she had died in her place.</p>
      <p>Skylar Richardson, from Ohio, in the US, was arrested after  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/police">police</a>  discovered charred remains of a newborn in a shallow grave.</p>
      <p>Her doctor had tipped off police, who brought the then 18-year-old in for questioning before charging her with aggravated murder.</p>
      <p>At the end of a lengthy trial a jury deliberated for four hours and found her not guilty of smashing her newborn baby's head with a stone.</p>
      <p>They concluded the child had been stillborn.</p>
      <p>Giving her version of events for the first time, Skylar, now 20, told how her mum Kim took her to her first gynecologist appointment two weeks before senior prom.</p>
      <p>The mum, who realised her daughter had been engaging in sexual behaviour with her boyfriend Brandon, wanted to get her on the pill.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>There the teenager, who had been preparing to go to the University of Cincinnati in the autumn, was told she was 32 weeks pregnant.</p>
      <p>As Skylar drove home with her mum she declined to tell her about the unborn baby.</p>
      <p>“I wish I would have done it differently, I’m plagued by guilt every day for not telling someone," she told <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/lifestyle/a29763428/skylar-richardson-exclusive-first-interview-not-guilty-murder-baby-prom/">Cosmo.</a></p>
      <p>She decided to open up about the pregnancy after prom.</p>
      <p>A photo taken on the night of the dance shows Skylar and Brandon posing outside Richardson's house.</p>
      <p>A small bump is visible beneath the young woman's red dress.</p>

      <p>At the time her friends and family assumed she'd finally overcome her long terms issues with eating disorders.</p>
      <p>Skylar didn't drink or stay long at the prom, Brandon taking her home before the dance had finished.</p>
      <p>The following day she suffered from stomach cramps so bad she almost collapsed when she tried to stand up.</p>
      <p>Not realising she was in labour, Skylar went to the bathroom and sat on the toilet with the sensation that "something needed to come out."</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>The baby girl, shocking white and wet with blood, fell into the bowl.</p>
      <p>She lifted the child from the water and realised she was dead.</p>
      <p>Her umbilical chord wasn't attached and the baby never moved or opened her eyes.</p>
      <p>“I hoped she would start coming alive,” she later told police.</p>
      <p>Covered in blood and slumped in the bathtub, Skylar felt unable to tell her parents or younger brother Jackson, 15, what had happened.</p>
      <p>So she decided to do the only thing she could think of - bury the baby.</p>

      <p>Skylar took her mother's garden trowel and dug a shallow grave in the backyard.</p>
      <p>While she prepared the baby's final resting place she decided to give her a name - Annabelle.</p>
      <p>Skylar unwrapped the towel swaddling baby Annabelle, placed her in the ground and covered her with a layer of dirt.</p>
      <p>She placed a bunch of pink flowers on the grave.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>It wasn't until July that Skylar spoke about the baby again.</p>
      <p>On a trip to the doctors to get birth control a different medic, tipped off by the first, asked her about the pregnancy.</p>
      <p>The teenager broke down, sobbing so loudly that people outside the consultation room could hear her.</p>
      <p>She told the doctors everything, believing because she had not harmed the baby there would be no recriminations.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>The doctor alerted the state authorities who called Skylar into a police station two days later.</p>
      <p>She told them numerous times that she did not kill the baby.</p>
      <p>Regardless, Skylar was charged with aggravated murder, involuntary manslaughter, child endangerment, tampering with evidence and gross abuse of a corpse.</p>
      <p>Two years later, when Skylar sat in front of the courtroom, she weighed less than 90pounds - the stress of the events causing her eating disorder to worsen.</p>

      <p>For two years she had been under house arrest and then having to abide by a strict curfew, left to hear about the fun her friends were having at college from her childhood bedroom.</p>
      <p>The ordeal has taken a toll on Skylar.</p>
      <p>She said: "Every night, I would lie down and wish that I could have died in place of Annabelle.”</p>
      <p>The trial, during which Skylar was accused of burning the baby, proved no better for her mental health.</p>
      <p>“Very few things have been harder than having to listen to prosecutors allege horrible, unthinkable things of me and put countless photos of my daughter’s bones on a big screen," she said.</p>
      <p>The idea that Skylar had acted selfishly and had other choices, as suggested by Tracy Johnson - whose son Trey turned out to be the biological father - came as a further blow.</p>
      <p>After turning down a plea bargain in which the most serious charge of aggravated murder would be dropped and a possible life sentence reduced to 15 years, Skylar was found not guilty of the killing.</p>
      <p>The one charge she was convicted of - abuse of a corpse - saw her sentenced to three years' probation.</p>
