      <h1>Mason Greenwood names Wayne Rooney as his Man Utd idol - despite never meeting him</h1>
      <h2>The 18-year-old forward is the latest young United striker to be exciting supporters at Old Trafford and he has admitted Rooney has always been his inspiration</h2>

      <p>Mason Greenwood has named Wayne Rooney and former Brazilian striker Ronaldo as his two biggest inspirations as he looks to seal a place in the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> first-team.</p>
      <p>Greenwood, who came through the academy at United, has been involved in a number of senior games this year after impressing during pre-season, and scored his first competitive goal for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side in the 1-0 Europa League win over Astana in September.</p>
      <p>He has added to that goal with strikes against Rochdale and Partizan Belgrade, and there are high hopes at the club for Greenwood, who has also represented England from U15 to U21 level.</p>

      <p>Speaking to the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7699313/Manchester-United-England-starlet-Mason-Greenwood-wants-Wayne-Rooney.html">Daily Mail</a> , Greenwood revealed the two biggest influences on his playing career.</p>
      <p>"It has to be Rooney," he said. "The Brazilian Ronaldo, too. They've always stood out for me and I've always looked up to them. Ronaldo was quite a while ago but my dad used to show me clips of him.</p>
      <p>"Rooney is such a great goalscorer and that is what I want to be. You have to have a role model. I've never seen him, though. I've watched his games and the highlights on YouTube. Hopefully I'll get to meet him one day."</p>
      <p>United fans will hope Greenwood can follow in the footsteps of Rooney, who is the club's all-time top scorer with 253 goals.</p>

      <p>The 18-year-old also praised manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer for allowing him the opportunities to shine in the senior team.</p>
      <p>"The manager is a really nice person," he added. "Obviously he was a great goalscorer at United and I know about him, I've watched him. He's a great manager in my eyes. I've got so many role models around me and Ole is another one. I just want to follow in his footsteps."</p>
