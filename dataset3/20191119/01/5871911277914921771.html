      <h1>Harrison Butker drains unbelievable 71-yard field goal before game in Mexico City (Video)</h1>

      <p>Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker’s range knows no bounds, apparently.</p>
      <p>Butker has been one of the most consistent kickers in the league this season — draining 45+ yard field goals as if they were extra points, with ease.</p>
      <p>He’s made 23 of 27 field goals he’s attempted, and one of the few misses was blocked in the team’s most recent game against the Titans– on a play that looked to be offside.</p>
      <p>Butker appears to be ready for Monday’s game against the Chargers in Mexico City, as he was seen on the field at Estadio Azteca casually draining a 71-yard (!!!) field goal.</p>

      <p>We’d love to see him do that in the game, as the NFL record is 64 yards (Matt Prater).</p>
