      <p>KUALA LUMPUR: Dagang NeXchange Bhd’s (DNeX) net profit grew 42.6% to RM9.48 million for the third quarter ended Sept 30, 2019 (3QFY19), from RM6.65 million for the previous corresponding quarter, thanks to a lower income tax.</p>
      <p>The company paid a lower income tax of RM831,000 for the quarter under review, compared with RM3.41 million last year, due to an over provision in the prior year.</p>
      <p>DNeX also posted an improved profit before tax from its energy segment of RM6.79 million, 69.8% higher from RM4 million for 3QFY18. Earnings per share expanded to 0.54 sen, from 0.38 sen.</p>
      <p>This was despite a 2.07% decline in quarterly revenue to RM62 million, from RM63.31 million, according to a filing with Bursa Malaysia yesterday.</p>
      <p>For the cumulative nine months, its net profit was down 3.65% to RM33.76 million or 1.92 sen per share, from RM35.04 million or 1.99 sen per share last year. Its revenue increased 9.45% to RM203.15 million, from RM185.6 million.</p>
      <p>DNeX said it expects to deliver positive results for 2019, barring any unforeseen circumstances.</p>
      <p>“The group continues to aggressively pursue its group-wide operational cost optimisation programme towards achieving improvements in operational efficiency and business profitability based on a sustainable cost structure, including consolidating existing business operations,” DNeX said.</p>
      <p>DNeX shares closed up one sen to 27.5 sen yesterday, valuing the company at RM483.46 million. Some 3.86 million shares were traded.</p>
