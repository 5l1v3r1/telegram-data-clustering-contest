      <h1>Powerhouse Supermarket Group Partners With Nestlé and IBM, Bringing Blockchain Food Tracking to Millions</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T01:45:53+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 01:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://dailyhodl.com/author/thedailyhodl/" target="_blank">Daily Hodl Staff</a></address>
      <p>Swiss multinational food and drink conglomerate Nestlé and giant French retailer Carrefour will use blockchain technology to track their Guigoz Bio 2 and 3 infant milk products “from dairy to shelf.” Consumers will be able to access all information by scanning the QR code with their smartphone.</p>
      <p>According to a company <a href="http://www.carrefour.com/sites/default/files/pr_carrefour_et_nestlee_blockchain_guigoz_fren.pdf">release</a>,</p>
      <p>
        <i>“[Blockchain, a] major technological advance is expected to boost consumer confidence by providing transparency on product checks and origins and is now available for all GUIGOZ® Bio 2 and 3 packaging across sales channels.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>Nestlé will share production data for Guigoz Bio 2 and 3, produced by Laboratoires Guigoz and sold in France.</p>
      <p>Carrefour will provide its expertise in consumer-focused blockchain development. The supermarket chain has over 5,600 stores in France, including convenience stores, as well as e-commerce and express delivery through mobile apps to service over three million customers daily.</p>
      <p>The blockchain platform was developed using the IBM Food Trust, a product tracking solution for food safety that allows suppliers, distributors, retailers and consumers to share global supply chain information securely. For parents it brings security for infant nutrition.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“For Nestlé and Laboratoires Guigoz, this innovative blockchain technology creates a new benchmark for transparency and the high standards of care required to ensure the quality of their products.”</i>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/IOTSWC/status/1189541846395117568">Says</a> Emanuel Delerm,</p>
      <p>
        <i>“‘In Carrefour we have been working all these years in blockchain because we are facing customers and their questions about guarantee, efficiency, biodiversity, traceability.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>In April, Nestlé, Carrefour and IBM collaborated on a blockchain that tracks the supply chain of Mousline, a popular brand of instant mashed potatoes, from potato fields to the store.</p>
