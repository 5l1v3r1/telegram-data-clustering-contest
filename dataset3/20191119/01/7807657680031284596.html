      <h4>Fix annoying connection and playback issues</h4>
      <p>As with other streaming services, you're bound to encounter some <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-fix-connection-issues-disney">connection</a> and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-fix-playback-issues-disney-plus">playback issues</a> every now and then. <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/error-83-disney-plus">Error 83</a> is one of the more commonly reported issues, which involves the Disney+ servers just being overwhelmed with users, which can happen when new episodes of shows come out.</p>
      <p>Other problems may just be more general connection issues with your modem and router, internet speeds, and the like. Make sure to follow basic troubleshooting protocol, such as restarting your device, app, and checking your speeds to see if your Disney+ problems get fixed.</p>
      <h4>What is Disney+?</h4>
      <p>Disney+ is the streaming service where you're exclusively most Disney family-friendly content going forward, with access to hundreds of films and thousands of TV episodes from Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar, Fox, and National Geographic, and of course Disney.</p>
      <p>A lot of Disney content on other streaming services has been or will be pulled after current license agreements expire and will be living on Disney+. This has been a long time coming, but the transition of content to Disney+ will still take a couple of years, especially with the recently acquired 20th Centur Fox content.</p>
      <h4>How much does Disney+ cost?</h4>
      <p>By itself, Disney+ will run you $7 a month or $70 annually. However, there's also a bundle that gets you Disney+, ESPN+, and ad-supported Hulu for $13 a month.</p>
      <h4>When is Disney+ available?</h4>
      <p>Disney+ launched on Nov. 12, 2019 in the U.S., Canada, and the Netherlands. Austraila and New Zealand also got Disney+ on Nov. 19. It'll release on March 31, 2020 in the U.K., France, Spain, Italy, Germany, and Ireland. This schedule is subject to change, with other countries getting added in the future.</p>
      <h4>Always Disney</h4>
