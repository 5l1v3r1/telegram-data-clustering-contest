      <p>THE BODY of drowning victim Lee Early was returned to his native Arranmore Island last night in a poignant final journey on board the ferry he skippered for so many years.</p>
      <p>Mr Early (26) <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2019/11/18/news/arranmore-island-pier-victim-lee-early-26-was-lifeboat-volunteer-1767911/">died when his car slipped off the pier</a> at Poolawaddy on Arranmore off the coast of west Donegal early on Sunday morning.</p>
      <p>A 30-year-old man, who was a passenger in the vehicle, managed to get out of the car and reach the shore. It is thought that Mr Early was attempting to turn his car on the pier when tragedy struck.</p>
      <p>Arranmore lifeboat, with which Mr Early himself was a volunteer, was called to the scene.</p>

      <p>However, despite the desperate efforts by his colleagues, Mr Early drowned. The victim's father, Jimmy is the coxswain of the island's lifeboat.</p>
      <p>A member of a well-known island family, Mr Early worked as skipper of the Arranmore ferry. When he earned his skipper’s ticket at the age of 20, the Donegal man became the youngest ever commercial passenger ship skipper in the Republic. A spokesman for the ferry company said they had lost their "skipper and friend".</p>

      <p>Mr Early’s funeral will take place from his family home on Arranmore tomorrow to St Crone’s Church with interment immediately after Requiem Mass in the island cemetery.</p>
      <p>Chairman of Donegal County Council Nicholas Crossan yesterday offered his condolences to his family.</p>
      <p>“It is such a tragedy for Lee’s family and for the entire community of Árainn Mhór. I have no doubt that the people of Árainn Mhór will come together to support and comfort the Early family at this very difficult time.”</p>
      <p>In a further gesture, the owners of Arranmore Hostel have announced that they are making all beds at the facility available free of charge for people travelling to the island for Mr Early’s wake and funeral.</p>
      <p>Chairman of the County Donegal island’s development co-operative said the tragedy had cast a dark cloud across the island. Jerry Early said messages of sympathy were flowing into Arranmore from around the world.</p>
      <p>Mr Early said everyone was broken hearted in the tight-knit community describing Lee as the “heart and soul” of the island.</p>
      <p>“A cut like this makes us all bleed,” he said.</p>
