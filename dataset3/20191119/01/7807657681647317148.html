      <p><b>Best Answer:</b> Yes, you can watch Disney Plus (Disney+) on your Roku streaming devices as well as a Roku TV. However, you'll need a newer Roku device with updated software in order to get Disney+, and some specific models are not compatible. In addition to the Roku, Disney+ is available on Apple TV, Android mobile devices, Amazon Fire TV devices and tablets, Android TV, Chromecast, desktop web browsers, iPad, iPhone, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One.</p>
      <p>All Disney, all the time: <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fdisneyplus.bn5x.net%2Fc%2F159229%2F705874%2F9358%3FsubId1%3DUUwpUdUnU71604YYw%26subId2%3Ddwp%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fpreview.disneyplus.com%252F&amp;token=QhHtmdxd">Disney+</a> ($7/month at Disney+)</p>
      <h4>So Disney+ works on both Roku streaming devices and Roku TV?</h4>
      <p>Yes, that's correct. As long as you are using a newer Roku device with up-to-date software, then you should be able to get Disney+ on it. This includes:</p>

        <li>Roku Streaming Stick</li>

        <li>4K Roku Ultra LT</li>
        <li>4K Roku Ultra</li>
        <li>Roku Premiere and Premiere+</li>
        <li>Roku Express and Express+</li>
        <li>Most numbered Roku devices.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The following models are <b>not compatible with Disney+</b>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Roku Streaming Stick models 3400X and 3420X</li>
        <li>Roku LT model 2400X and 2450X</li>
        <li>Roku 2 HD models 3000X and 3050X</li>
        <li>Roku 2 XS model 3100X</li>
        <li>Roku HD model 2500X</li>
      </ul>
