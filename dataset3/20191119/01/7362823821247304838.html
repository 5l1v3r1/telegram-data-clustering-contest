      <h1>Mariah Carey's son, Rocky, 'snuck up on' Ryan Reynolds in Deadpool mask</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T01:02:29+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 01:02</time> by <a rel="author">Nate Day</a></address>
      <p>Move over, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/ryan-reynolds-joker-deadpool-highest-grossing-r-rated-film">Ryan Reynolds</a>, there's a new <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/search-results/foxnews.com/category/entertainment/movies">Deadpool</a> in town.</p>
      <p>In a Sunday Instagram post, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/mariah-carey">Mariah Carey</a>Â shared a hilarious moment with herÂ twins, Monroe and Moroccan (Rocky), "Deadpool" star Ryan Reynolds and his wife, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/blake-lively-ryan-reynolds-donatation-migrant-children">Blake Lively</a>.</p>
      <p>In the photo, Carey, 49, and her eight-year-olds smile alongside Reynolds 43, and Lively, 32. Instead of smiling like his mother, however, Rocky donned a Deadpool mask and crossed his arms.</p>

      <p>Reynolds, best known for playing the superhero,Â would later comment on the post, saying: "Whoa. My vision board became a photo."</p>
