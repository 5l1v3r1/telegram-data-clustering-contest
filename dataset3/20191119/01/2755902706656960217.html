      <p>In an interview with the local publication, <a href="https://www.dailynews.co.zw/articles/2019/11/18/bev-fires-dancer-over-immorality">DailyNews</a>, Bev revealed that she recently fired Bafana because <i>Aikechesa</i>, a colloquial term for commercial s_ex work. Bev also added that adult entertainers do not have loose morals in contrast to popular belief that they are prostitutes.</p>
      <aside>Gonyeti was no longer coming to shows because of many relationships which were now interfering with our work. We also clashed over her failure to send her child to school while spending money on booze. I believe we should be able to look after our children because after all, we work for them. I was again not happy with the nature of her relationship which affected our work. Aikechesa. (She engaged in commercial s_ex work). She would at times fail to come for shows.</aside>
      <p>Bafana confirmed that she had indeed fallen out with Sibanda but disputed the immorality allegations.</p>
      <aside>I was having issues in my life and I also got sick at some point that I could not attend shows. I only have one man whom I was also having issues with, it’s not true that I was having several affairs.</aside>
      <p>Bafanai also added that she had assembled her own group, which is the reason why Sibanda is making the spurious allegations so as to derail her.</p>
