      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/nicki-chapman">Nicki Chapman</a> says her brain tumour hasn't grown at all six months after lifesaving surgery.</p>
      <p>The brave 52-year-old told her fans the great news as she continues her incredible recovery.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the Escape To The Country presenter shocked everyone after announcing she had been diagnosed with the aggressive cancer.</p>
      <p>Nicki said her tumour was 'the size of a golf ball' in a worrying statement but since going under the knife things have taken a turn for the better.</p>
      <p>The former Pop Idol judge took to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B47iO3xBufW/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link">Instagram</a> to provide a very welcome update.</p>
      <p>Nicki shared her progress and gave a big thumbs up at Charing Cross Hospital in a brilliant snap on the social media site.</p>
      <p>She caption her photo: "I got the best news this week: Six months after my surgery, my consultant (also my hero) has said the remaining tumour hasn't grown.</p>

      <p>"Small steps but a huge relief. My grateful thanks to the wonderful team #CharingCrossHospital #Neurosurgery &amp; @ImperialNHS @NHSEnglandLDN @TheBrainTumourCharity."</p>
      <p>She spoke in the summer on ITV’s This Morning - and praised the NHS.</p>
      <p>“Someone told me it’s a dark gift when you get diagnosed with something like this," she said.</p>
      <p>“I know what they mean. It absolutely changes your perspective.</p>

      <p>“It was so scary. I was petrified and I remained as positive as I could.</p>
      <p>“And now I look at people in a slightly different way. I don’t judge them so quickly. I hope now I am more patient, more kind, more forgiving.</p>
      <p>"Before, I was quite judgmental. I hope all of life ­experiences change you and make you a better and stronger person.”</p>

      <p>She added: “I knew the NHS were ­brilliant – I now literally worship their feet.</p>
      <p>"They make you feel so special and as if you are the first person to have this. You are not.</p>
      <p>“I have been fortunate. When you hear other people’s stories and you realise the outcome hasn’t been as good as mine, it makes you feel very grateful."</p>
