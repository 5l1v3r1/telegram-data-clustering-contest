      <p>Moree police are reminding residents to be vigilant in reporting suspicious activity, following a spate of deliberately-lit fires around town in the past week.</p>
      <p>Since Thursday, November 15, police and NSW Fire and Rescue have been called to 10 fires in Moree - a mixture of house, grass and bin fires, according to acting Inspector Cameron Paine.</p>
      <p>"The fires seem to be occurring in and around these little pockets where there are boarded-up houses and previously-burnt houses," acting Inspector Paine said.</p>
      <p>"There have also been scrub and bush fires at all times of the day."</p>

      <p>Considering the devastating impacts bushfires have had across the country over the past few weeks, acting Inspector Paine said no fires should be lit during this period of total fire bans.</p>
      <p>"It only takes a tiny escalation for a fire to go a bit awry and get out of control," he said.</p>
      <p>"We're proactively working to find out who's doing this.</p>
      <p>"We ask people to remain vigilant and report anything suspicious."</p>
