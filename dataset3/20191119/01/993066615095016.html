      <p>POLICE investigating an attack by a gang wielding machetes in Co Fermanagh are believed to be probing a link to a feud between members of the Travelling community.</p>
      <p>A 13-year-old girl suffered stab wounds as she tried to protect her baby nephew during the terrifying attack at a house in Lisnaskea.</p>
      <p>Police said a number of men armed with machetes broke into the property in Trasna Way on Saturday shortly after 9pm. The gang attacked the teenager and the baby's grandmother, Elizabeth Joyce.</p>
      <p>A video circulating on social media shows the 13-year-old clutching a towel to her chest and appears to show her injuries, which include a deep wound running down her back.</p>
      <p>She remained in hospital last night in a critical but stable condition.</p>
      <p>Ms Joyce (41) was treated for stab wounds to her leg. The 11-month-old baby was unharmed.</p>
      <p>"It is something that we will never get over," Ms Joyce told BBC News NI.</p>
      <p>"The baby was unharmed because his auntie is a hero.</p>
      <p>"She's 13 years old and she threw her whole self over that baby, and she saved his life. She is a hero."</p>
      <p>It is understood the family belong to the Travelling community and the attack may be linked to a dispute between families in Fermanagh and Longford.</p>
      <p>No arrests have been made yet by police, who are treating the attack as attempted murder.</p>
      <p>PSNI Detective Sergeant Keith Monaghan said: "We are determined to find the men responsible.</p>
      <p>"We have several lines of enquiry we are progressing but I would ask anyone with information or who noticed any suspicious activity in the area to contact detectives in Enniskillen and pass that information on".</p>
