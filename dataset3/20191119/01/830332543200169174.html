      <h1>PG&amp;E may shut off power to more than 300,000 customers in California due to wind starting Wednesday</h1>
      <h2>High winds, dry conditions expected midweek</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T01:50:16+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 01:50</time> by <a rel="author">Hollie Silverman, CNN</a></address>
      <p>SAN FRANCISCO - PG&amp;E is warning customers that they may have to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/30/us/pge-credit-october-power-shutoff/index.html">shut off power</a> in 25 counties due to a strong offshore wind this week.</p>
      <p>More than 300,000 California residents could be impacted by a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/19/us/pge-power-shut-off-fires-ten-years/index.html">Public Safety Power Shutoff (PSPS) </a>as winds pick up Wednesday morning and last until Thursday morning, a <a href="https://www.pge.com/en/about/newsroom/newsdetails/index.page?title=20191117_pge_continues_tracking_mid-week_strong_offshore_wind_event_may_need_to_proactively_turn_off_power_for_safety_for_approximately_250000_customers_in_portions_of_19_counties_in_sierra_foothills_north_valley_and_north_bay">release from the utility said.</a></p>
      <p>The areas affected are the Sierra Foothills, North Valley and North Bay. Other parts of the Bay Area are not expected to be included, according to the release.</p>
      <p>"High fire-risk conditions are expected to begin early Wednesday morning and continue into Thursday. High winds are currently expected to subside Thursday mid-morning," the press release says.</p>
      <p>PG&amp;E meteorologists are monitoring and currently anticipate sustained winds of up to 25 mph and gusts ranging from 30-50 mph. Fire weather watches have been issued in the service area because vegetation is extremely dry and temperatures are 5-15 degrees above average, the release said.</p>
      <p>On Monday afternoon, around 39,000 PG&amp;E customers in the areas of Santa Cruz, Santa Clara and San Mateo were notified of a possible shutoff. Earlier in the day 264,000 customers were told that they were at risk of having their power shut off as a precaution, the release said.</p>
      <p>The utility began implementing PSPS this fire season to mitigate fires caused by power equipment. The practice cuts electricity to avoid causing fires during high winds and dry conditions.</p>
      <p>PG&amp;E serves about 5 million electric customers statewide and rolling outages have impacted several areas so far this fire season.</p>
      <p>In October, PG&amp;E cut off power to almost 800,000 customers in Northern California to lower the risk of wildfires. The shutoff <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/10/us/pge-power-outage-thursday/index.html">cost the city of San Jose at least a half a million dollars.</a></p>
      <p>PG&amp;E announced it had reached an <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/13/us/pge-california-wildfires-settlement/index.html">$11 billion settlement</a> with insurance companies for claims stemming from the devastating 2017 and 2018 wildfires in Northern California in September.</p>
      <p>In June, the utility paid $1 billion in damages to local governments for blazes linked to its power lines, poles and other equipment.</p>
      <p>These planned outages could continue for a decade, PG&amp;E chief executive Bill Johnson said during a California Public Utilities Commission meeting last month.</p>
      <p>The utility is working to notify residents 48 hours before a potential shutoff to give them time to prepare, the release said.</p>
