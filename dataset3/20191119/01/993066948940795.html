      <p>The shocking machete attack in Co Fermanagh that left a 13-year-old girl fighting for her life and another woman injured was an absolutely horrific crime which could have led to loss of life.</p>
      <p>An 11-month-old baby boy was also in the house at the time and was fortunate to escape injury.</p>
      <p>This was due to the bravery of the teenage victim, the baby's aunt, who threw herself across the baby to shield him from the assailants.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the baby's grandmother, Elizabeth Joyce, needed stitches for stab wounds sustained in the terrifying incident.</p>
      <p>This appalling act of savagery took place in a house at Trasna Way in Lisnaskea on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>A three man gang armed with machetes forced their way into the home and carried out the vicious attack on those inside.</p>
      <p>Graphic video footage of the aftermath of the attack has been posted on social media, showing the gruesome extent of the injuries suffered by the teenage girl, which included a deep gash running down her back.</p>
      <p>A separate video clip, also circulating online, appears to show a number of men approaching the house.</p>
      <p>It is difficult to comprehend how men wielding deadly weapons could carry out such a barbaric and violent onslaught on a young girl and another woman, and be entirely reckless about the danger to a helpless infant.</p>
      <p>It is not clear what lies behind this dreadful crime although police are believed to be examining a link to a feud between members of the Travelling community.</p>
      <p>However, there can be no possible justification for this attack which is being treated as attempted murder.</p>
      <p>PSNI Detective Sergeant Keith Monaghan said officers are determined to find the men responsible.</p>
      <p>There is no doubt the perpetrators are extremely dangerous.</p>
      <p>Anyone who arms themselves with a machete, forces their way into a home where a baby is present then attacks the terrified and vulnerable inhabitants within, inflicting potentially life-threatening injuries, needs to be apprehended and brought before the courts.</p>
      <p>Anyone with information about this attack or who can assist the police in any way with their inquiries, must come forward as a matter of urgency.</p>
