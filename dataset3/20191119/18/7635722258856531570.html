      <h1>"Oh, he looks the business" | Ronan Kelleher's made a big impression on Brian O'Driscoll</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T18:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.newstalk.com/author/raf-diallo" target="_blank">Raf Diallo</a></address>

        <b>A name increasingly on Irish rugby fans' lips is Ronan Kelleher.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Leinster hooker has made an outstanding start to the 2019-20 season for his province.</p>
      <p>In the Pro14, he has been a try-scoring machine and has<a href="https://www.leinsterrugby.ie/player?PlayGuid=RK712948"><b> brought his tally</b> </a>to seven tries in six games.</p>
      <p>And it comes at an interesting time for the hooker position for Ireland. Ex-Ulster and Ireland captain Rory Best has departed the scene, leaving an interesting void to fill for the next World Cup cycle.</p>
      <p>So where does Ronan Kelleher fit in? Ireland and Leinster legend Brian O'Driscoll shared his thoughts <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9GP2s6uOYU"><b>on <i>Off The Ball</i></b></a>.</p>
      <p>"Oh, he looks the business," he said, clearly excited by the player's potential.</p>
      <h3>Timing Couldn't Have Been Better</h3>
      <p>"I think the players are very excited about him. The timing for him couldn't be better either with the retirement of Rory Best and the situation Sean Cronin finds himself in. Seven tries in seven games this season isn't it?"</p>
      <p>Aside from that excellent statistical outlay at the try-line, BOD also touched on his work around the field.</p>
      <p>"There's a confidence to his throwing and to his darts," he continued.</p>
      <p>"Even with the spiral and the intent of the spiral, I think you can tell a lot how confident somebody is. It looks like a wounded duck when the confidence levels aren't there. So I think he looks like the real deal.</p>
      <p>"He gets through a lot of work, carries well and he's been in the right place at the right time for a couple of his scores. But for obvious reasons, people are getting very excited about the potential for him to be fast-tracked into an Irish set-up."</p>
