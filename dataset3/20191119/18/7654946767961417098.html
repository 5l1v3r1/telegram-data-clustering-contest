      <p>A man tried to steal two sets of truck keys at a Brooklyn U-Haul facility – and then bit an employee who confronted him, police said.</p>
      <p>The thief made his way into the U-Haul rental outpost on Washington Avenue in Prospect Heights last Thursday at around 8:30 a.m., cops said.</p>
      <p>A 51-year-old employee confronted the intruder, and during the struggle, the suspect chomped down on a finger on the worker’s left hand,  according to police. The suspect then fled without taking the keys, cops added.</p>
      <p>The victim was not seriously injured and refused medical attention at the scene.</p>
      <p>The NYPD released photos and surveillance footage of the suspect in the hopes that the public may be able to help authorities track him down.</p>
