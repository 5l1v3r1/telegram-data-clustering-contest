      <p>Chase Young is set to make his return to the gridiron for Ohio State this weekend. He <a href="https://thespun.com/big-ten/ohio-state-buckeyes/ohio-state-ncaa-length-of-chase-young-suspension">missed the past two games</a> due to a suspension from the NCAA.</p>
      <p>Ohio State didn’t miss a beat with Young out of the lineup against Maryland and Rutgers. This weekend will be different, with Penn State coming to town.</p>
      <p>In order to stop the Nittany Lions on offense, the Buckeyes are going to need a strong performance from Young. Luckily for Ryan Day, it sounds like his superstar defensive end is ready for the challenge.</p>
      <p>Young posted a picture of himself <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5DfVgVAfYQ">on Instagram</a> with the following message: “Chip on my shoulder only gotten bigger.”</p>
      <p>On the surface this seems like a cryptic comment from Young, but he could just be alluding to the fact that he felt unfairly suspended the past two weeks.</p>
      <p>Regardless of what his caption actually means, the potential Heisman Trophy candidate is eager to get back on the field for the first time in three weeks.</p>

      <p>Some analysts thought Chase Young might find himself in the Heisman Trophy race prior to his suspension. It’s rare for a defensive end to have 13.5 sacks in just eight games.</p>
      <p>Young should be highly motivated to boost his sack total this weekend, which is bad news for Penn State.</p>
