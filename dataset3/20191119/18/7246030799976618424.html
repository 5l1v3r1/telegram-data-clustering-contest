      <h1>Israel Sees Uptick in Motor Vehicle Fatalities After Decades of Improvements</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T18:53:07+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 18:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.jewishpress.com/author/arye-green/" target="_blank">Arye Green / TPS</a></address>
      <p>Israel’s decades-long trend of a decline in traffic fatalities has reversed itself in 2019, the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) announced Tuesday as it released its data for Road Safety Week.</p>
      <p>The number of fatal car accidents increased by 14 percent in the first three quarters of 2019, reaching a total of 228 fatal accidents compared to 200 in the same period last year.</p>
      <p>The uptick in fatalities was even sharper, up by 18 percent compared to 2018, with 249 deaths compared to last year’s 211, a total of 38 more deaths this year than last.</p>
      <p>The number of fatalities in car accidents reached a record of 750 deaths in 1975, peaking again with 709 deaths in 1995. Ever since, the number of fatalities in car accidents has been on a downward trend, reaching a low of 316 fatalities in 2018.</p>
      <p>The rapid growth of the Israeli population during the same period has rendered the decline even sharper when measured per capita.</p>
      <p>Last year Israel reached its lowest ever number of car accident fatalities per capita, at 3.6 deaths per 100,000 people.</p>
      <p>The record 2018 figure is nearly six times better than that of 1975, representing a long-term trend of improving Israel’s road safety.</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen whether the increase in car accident fatalities in 2019 is the beginning of a long-term trend or a short laps in the improvement of road safety in Israel.</p>
