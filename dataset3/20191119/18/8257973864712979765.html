      <p>Nov. 19 (UPI) -- <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/North_Korea/?tps=1">North Korea</a> state media claimed Tuesday scientists have developed a new diagnostic method for African swine fever.</p>
      <p>Propaganda service Meari said Tuesday researchers at North Korea's veterinary research institute have developed a new "genetic analysis" to diagnose African swine fever. The method is highly effective, Meari said.</p>
      <p>Scientists at the North Korean institute have also developed a vaccine that can prevent foot-and-mouth disease, a severe, highly contagious viral disease among cattle.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Kim_Jong_Un/?tps=1">Kim Jong Un</a> regime could be battling African swine fever since May 30, when it first reported the disease at its border with China.</p>
      <p>North Korea's pig population may have decreased by more than 55 percent as a result of the disease.</p>
      <p>In China, the meat substitute industry is rolling out new products as African swine fever takes its toll on pig farms and pork prices rise amid a trade dispute with the United States.</p>
      <p>Chinese firms Zhenmeat and Starfield are some of the plant-based companies that are looking to diversify its products. Zhenmeat, a relatively new startup, creates a meat-like product out of pea-based protein in its moon cakes, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/19/beyond-meat-vs-zhenmeat-the-battle-for-chinas-meatless-market.html">CNBC reported</a> Tuesday.</p>
      <p>"We are analyzing the flavoring behind pork meat, and we are taking on that to make a difference between our competitor from the United States," said Zhenmeat co-founder Vince Lu.</p>
      <p>African swine fever also spread to South Korea earlier this year, where troops were deployed to the demilitarized zone to guard against the disease.</p>
      <p>South Korean farms in the border region may be recovering, however.</p>
      <p>Newsis reported Tuesday farms in four areas in Gyeonggi Province that were affected have not reported new cases of African swine fever for more than two months.</p>
      <p>The ASF virus was not found in recent inspections of farm equipment and facilities, raising the possibility of lifting restrictions on livestock in the area, according to the report.</p>
