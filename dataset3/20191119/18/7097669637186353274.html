      <h1>Stephen Miller covertly directed Breitbart to attack Marco Rubio and Fox News, new emails reveal</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T18:15:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 18:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://theweek.com/" target="_blank">Kathryn Krawczyk</a></address>
      <p>White House adviser Stephen Miller was in deep with <i>Breitbart.</i></p>
      <p>Last week, the Southern Poverty Law Center <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/878087/stephen-miller-fed-white-nationalist-ideas-breitbart-exeditor-says-theyve-since-become-policy">published emails</a> sent from Miller to the right-wing publication during the 2016 race showing how he directed white nationalist viewpoints on the site, and how those views "became policy" in the Trump White House. A <a href="https://www.splcenter.org/hatewatch/2019/11/19/miller-turned-breitbart-promote-political-agenda#finding">second batch of emails</a> now shows there's more to Miller's back-door <i>Breitbart</i> publication, including how he fed the site attacks on then-presidential candidate Marco Rubio.</p>
      <p>The new round of emails obtained via former <i>Breitbart</i> editor Katie McHugh shows even more news stories, opinion pieces, and other comments Miller suggested the site could turn into new articles. For example, as a communications director for then-Sen. Jeff Sessions, he sent over at least 10 attacks on Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) that fueled <i>Breitbart</i>'s attempts to "harm his candidacy," McHugh said. And when Fox News and other conservative outlets said anything positive about Rubio, he suggested <i>Breitbart</i> take them down as well. In some cases, he explicitly said his suggested articles should be published under the nondescript byline "Breitbart News."</p>
      <p>McHugh was sent many of these emails, but <i>Breitbart</i> editor turned White House adviser Stephen Bannon and other editors were copied on the emails too. McHugh was a young editor at the site at the time, and said "no one at <i>Breitbart</i> ever raised a question about whether this was ethical." The White House and Bannon did not respond to a request for comment, while <i>Breitbart</i> said Miller's "pitches" were "not exactly a newsflash." The White House previously said "The SPLC â€¦ is an utterly-discredited, long-debunked far-left smear organization" in response to reporting about Miller.</p>
