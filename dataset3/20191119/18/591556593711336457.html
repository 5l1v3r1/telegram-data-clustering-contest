      <p>This is a must for serious cyclists who ride in the dark. The <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/speednite-a-smart-bike-lighting-system-for-safety#/">Speednite bike light</a> comes with a helmet sensor that attaches to a Velcro pad on the helmet and connects by Bluetooth to your bike light.</p>
      <p>When you move your head to scan the road ahead, the bike light sweeps up and down, and side to side to follow your gaze. The bike light is 800 lumens, which gives a really good view of the road ahead. There is also a rear light fitting that flashes rapidly if you brake. Sensors on the main unit detect when your head moves to the left or right and shines a flashing red laser line onto the road to show your intended direction of movement.  <br/><br/>The main unit lets you change from a full beam, half beam, quick flash, slow flash and off. Speed, cadence, and heart rate are displayed on the main unit on your handlebars. The device will connect to most heart rate monitors.</p>
      <p>The app is well written and easy to use showing history, current ride information and set wheel information for your bike. Integration with Google Maps shows your route. You can configure SOS which will alert a pre-set emergency SOS contact for help if you have an accident. <br/><br/>Bluetooth connection to each remote unit is fast and easy to use and the side indicator lights are really useful. My only challenge was to cancel the side indicator without invoking the other side indicator. This is a superb gadget for every bike rider who takes trips in the dark.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jackery-Portable-Power-Station-Generator/dp/B07D29QNMJ/?tag=zdnet-deals-20">Jackery portable power station</a> gives you peace of mind in a power cut. It has a huge 16.8Ah lithium-ion battery that will charge all of your tech equipment, and it will also power your 110V 200W appliances. <br/><br/>It will recharge your laptop over three times, drones for up to four recharges and your iPhone up to 25 times. Being without power for an extended period is no longer a major issue. An LCD display shows you the input and output wattage as well as a batter percentage display. <br/><br/>Usefully, there is a range of charging options. You can charge it from your car port, from a generator or a mains AC outlet, which will take about seven hours. Or you can buy an optional 60W Jackery solar charger to recharge the device in full sunshine, meaning you can go completely off-grid. <br/><br/>A safety cut off feature means that if you try to power devices that use more than 200W -- such as a hairdryer -- then the device will shut off the power automatically. <br/><br/>This is a great backup for anyone who lives in an area with frequent power cuts and who still needs to be connected during a power outage. Buy one and leave it fully charged for those just-in-case moments.</p>

      <p>If you like to record audio on your phone but find that hands-free sound is not good enough, try the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lavalier-Microphone-Professional-Omnidirectional-Condenser/dp/B07PW4QCRM/?tag=zdnet-deals-20">Lavalier lapel microphone</a>. You can record interviews, conversations, or videos directly with this lapel microphone on both Android or iPhone devices. <br/><br/>The quality is better than using the phone's audio on its own. It will record clear sound for conversations or ambient noise in the near vicinity. If you use this outside, it is best to add the muffler to the microphone to minimize wind noise and improve the quality of the sound you want to capture. <br/><br/>The microphone also has a 4-pin to 3-pin adaptor so it will also work on your PC, camera, or audio recorder.</p>

      <p>If you are out and about and need to transfer data from one device, often there is only one USB port available -- and you invariably need to access more than one device.  <br/><br/>This <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sabrent-4-Port-Individual-Switches-HB-UM43/dp/B00JX1ZS5O/?tag=zdnet-deals-20">4-port USB 3.0 hub from Sabrent</a> is ultra-fast, will support transfer speeds up to 5GBps, and extends the ports on your laptop. You can switch each port on and off individually. This hub will not charge your devices, unfortunately.</p>

      <p>If you have ever lost a metal item in a pond or creek, you would have appreciated having one of these fishing magnets from Savage Magnets to hand. They will retrieve your phone from that drain or will pull up to 1000lb pull force from the water from a magnet weighing only 2.65 pounds.  <br/><br/>So, do not worry if your laptop sinks beneath the water, you will be able to retrieve it with this magnet. Your problems will only start if you try to use it again. This will not retrieve your gold wedding ring -- so you need to think of another way to find it.</p>
