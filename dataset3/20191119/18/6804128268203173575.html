      <h1>The one Chelsea player that Man City must stop - it's not Tammy Abraham or Mason Mount</h1>
      <h2>Shaun Goater has been speaking about Man City, Chelsea and the upcoming Premier League clash between the two sides</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T18:10:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 18:10</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Clarke</a></address>
      <p>Manchester City legend Shaun Goater has identified the key <a href="https://www.football.london/chelsea-fc/">Chelsea</a> player his side must stop to ensure the two-time reigning champions get back on track in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>Chelsea are surprisingly ahead of Pep Guardiola's men prior the fixture thanks to shocking defeats against Norwich City and Wolves, while leaders Liverpool dealt City a title blow before the international break.</p>
      <p>Frank Lampard's men currently sit third in the league thanks to six consecutive victories which has the visitors on Saturday to the Etihad Stadium one point clear of their upcoming opponents.</p>
      <p>Chelsea's form is in many ways as surprising as City's inconsistency but Goater says the one truly amazing thing about Lampard's side is the brilliance of <a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/jorginho">Jorginho</a>.</p>
      <p>The midfielder was much-maligned in his debut season at Stamford Bridge under Maurizio Sarri but Goater insists that the playmaker has become the number one man to stop this weekend.</p>
      <p>"Jorginho has been brilliant. He is huge in the transition and how they play," Goater, who was speaking on behalf of GentingBet, told football.london.</p>
      <p>"When they transition the play from back to front he is critical during those moments. Man City must stop him because he provides the supply for Abraham and the wingers.</p>

      <p>"He provides that directly but also indirectly as well. The pass he gives into the eight and ten then goes into the wide players and Tammy.</p>
      <p>"It's crazy because it looked like Chelsea fans didn't like him a year ago. He looks really good in that role and position."</p>
      <p>Whilst Goater is backing City to prevail at home as they aim to keep pace in the title race, he is quick to acknowledge the threat posed by Chelsea.</p>
      <p>"This game against Chelsea becomes much more important (after the loss to Liverpool)," Goater added. "That's because to come back from a distance of 12 points would be huge. The reason I say it would be huge is because of the current form that Liverpool are in.</p>
      <p>"It's vitally important for City to claw back these points slowly but surely. It makes this game absolutely huge and a must win.</p>
      <p>"Great teams do not go back to back losing games. For that reason there is a huge part of me that feels City will go on and win this game.</p>
      <p>"There is also equally a part of me that from a footballing point of view is liking what Frank Lampard is doing at Chelsea.</p>
