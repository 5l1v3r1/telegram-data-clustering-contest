      <p><i><a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/321784-segas-football-manager-mobile-2018-is-now-available-on-the-play-store/">Football Manager 2020</a></i> has been officially released on the Google Play Store, delivering your favorite combination of football and management simulation right to your smartphone or tablet. Like last year, the title is being released as two versions; one called Mobile, and one called <i>Touch</i>.</p>
      <h3>Mobile vs Touch</h3>
      <p>Both variants of <i>Football Manager 2020</i> are more or less the same game. There’s the same amount of content, mostly the same gameplay mechanics, same yearly updates, etc. <i>Mobile</i> is a full port of the PC version of the game, bringing with it everything that you’d get if you went and bought it on Steam right now.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, <i>Touch</i> is built to be a little more, well, touch-friendly. It’s designed for tablets and isn’t available to install on any of my current devices except my <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/tag/galaxy-s10/">Galaxy S10</a> (maybe a glitch?) because of its focus on bigger screens. But it foregoes the traditional interface to work better as a mobile game while still retaining the core gameplay that people want every year.</p>
      <p>Since these games are more in line with a typical full game release, they’re priced a little higher than your standard mobile game, too. <i>FM20 Mobile</i> will run $8.99 with in-app purchases for specific bits of DLC, while <i>FM20 Touch</i> sits a little higher at $19, but again with DLC. All of these are priced more affordably than their Steam counterparts, though, so you’ve got that going for it.</p>
