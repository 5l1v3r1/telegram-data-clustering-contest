      <h2>Both say they are open to working together in politics</h2>

      <p>Chief Minister-aspirants Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan said that they would form a political alliance and contest elections together if it would benefit the people of Tamil Nadu and if the circumstances warranted it.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Speaking to reporters at the airport, Mr. Rajinikanth was asked about Mr. Haasan’s comment earlier in the day that he would work with him for the prosperity and development of Tamil Nadu. Echoing Mr. Haasan’s comments, Mr. Rajinikanth said, “If a situation arises that warrants us to work with each other for the benefit of people of Tamil Nadu, I will work with Kamal Haasan.”</p>
      <p>There has been an intense media speculation over whether the superstars and long-time friends would work together in politics. The bonhomie that Mr. Rajinikanth and Mr. Haasan shared at an event conducted to celebrate 60 years’ of Mr. Haasan in cinema on Sunday fuelled the idea that both of them are thinking of such a possibility.</p>
      <p>Mr. Haasan, who received an honorary doctorate from Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik on Tuesday, said that he would join hands with Mr. Rajinikanth if Tamil Nadu’s development and prosperity depended on it.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the reporters earlier, he said that there was nothing ‘wonderous’ about the two getting together as they have been friends for many years.</p>
      <p>“We have been together for 44 years. We will join hands together when there is a necessity to do so. Right now, there is plenty of work to do. If Rajinikanth and I need to come together for Tamil Nadu’s development and prosperity, we will do so,” said Kamal Haasan.</p>
