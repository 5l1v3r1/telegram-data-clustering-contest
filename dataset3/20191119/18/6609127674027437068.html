      <p>There is no suggestion that the rape is linked to the alleged assaults.</p>
      <p>But a police spokeswoman confirmed they are following a "number of lines of enquiry" in connection with the rape.</p>
      <p>Increased security patrols have now been brought in around the University of Glasgow campus and improved lighting has been installed.</p>
      <p>In a social media warning, uni bosses said: "Recently there have been four alleged cases of sexual assault in the West End of Glasgow.</p>
      <p>"Incidents like this are rare and student and staff safety is of the utmost importance to the University.</p>
      <p>"We work extremely closely with Police Scotland and we have increased security patrols and improved lighting on campus.</p>
      <p>"If you have any concerns or information to report, please contact our security team on 0141 330 4282 or Police Scotland 101."</p>
