      <p>GREEN BAY, Wis. - Green Bay police say an abduction suspect is now dead after a confrontation with police Tuesday morning. </p>
      <p>Authorities said 38-year-old Luis Cardona abducted his ex-girlfriend Babette Caraballo shortly before 5 a.m. Tuesday from her place of employment, Hansen's Frozen Foods. The two left the business in a black SUV. </p>
      <p>An official said the vehicle was located through a cellphone inside, and a SWAT team responded.</p>
      <p>During a news conference at about 11:30 a.m., Kewaunee County Sheriff Matt Joski said the SUV ended up near an ATV park in Kewaunee County, where shots were fired. </p>
      <p>Joski said Cardona shot Caraballo. A deputy shot and killed Cardona.</p>
      <p>Caraballo was taken to a hospital in Green Bay. Her condition or the extent of the gunshot injuries was not immediately known Tuesday. </p>
      <p>"It's a tragedy. It's a true tragedy," Joski said. </p>
      <p>Police had contact with Cardona last week when he showed up at Caraballo's residence and tried to persuade her to come with him, but she refused, <a href="https://fox11online.com/news/local/gb-police-searching-for-kidnap-victim-and-suspect">WLUK-TV reported</a>.</p>
