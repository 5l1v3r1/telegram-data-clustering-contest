      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/chelsea">Chelsea </a>take on <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/manchester-city">Manchester City</a> in the Premier League on Saturday and <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/eden-hazard">Eden Hazard</a> has backed his former side to beat Pep Guardiola's men. The Real Madrid star was talking to <a href="https://www.skysports.com/watch/video/sports/football/11864570/hazard-chelsea-partying-without-me">Sky Sports News</a> when he was asked if he watches Chelsea matches and if he thinks the Blues can beat City this weekend.</p>
      <blockquote>Hazard said: <i>“Of course I think so. It’s not going to be easy. It’s hard to play there. Last time we played them we lost 6-0, so bad memories for me and for Chelsea as well.”</i></blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“But I think this season they are really good. They are really young, but they are really good, so why not go there and win the game?”</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Chelsea have enjoyed a good start to the season and occupy the third spot in the table. Hazard, on the other hand, is slowly getting into the groove at Real Madrid. After a poor start in the Spanish capital, the Belgian has found some form and is playing well for the Spanish side, although he is yet to hit top gear.</p>
      <p>Real Madrid are joint top of La Liga with 25 points from 12 games. However, they've not been at their best in the Champions League; they were outplayed by PSG and also held to a draw at home by Club Brugge in a couple of their matches.</p>
