      <p>The GBP/USD pair dropped further during the American session at a slow pace and printed a fresh daily low at 1.2919. It trades at 1.2923, holding a bearish bias as it continues to retreat after approaching 1.3000 last week. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/gbpusd">The pound</a> lost ground also against the yen and <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/eurusd">the euro</a> on Tuesday, on a day with limited price action. Still, the pound continues to show some strength as it has been the case since mid-October. Today in the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Labor leader Jeremy Corbyn will hold the first debate ahead of the general election. </p>
      <p>The US dollar did not benefit today from<a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/news/us-homebuilding-is-gradually-gaining-momentum-wells-fargo-201911191740"> housing data t</a>hat showed a strong rebound in October. Lower US yields weighed on the greenback. The 10-year yield dropped below 1.80% for the first time since November 4. Tomorrow <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar">FOMC</a> minutes will be released. </p>
      <p>“It was a quiet day for financial markets, with light data flow and speakers. However, it was noticeable that fixed income markets rallied despite equity markets being stable, suggestive of a market that remains cautious about the growth outlook. The immediate focus remains on the US-China trade talks, and markets seem reluctant to move much in either direction until they are resolved”, explained ANZ analyst. </p>
      <h3>GBP fails again near 1.3000</h3>
      <p>On Monday, GBP/USD reached at 1.2983 the strongest level in almost a month and then pulled back. For the third time in thirty days, the upside in the pair is capped around 1.3000. A consolidation above would clear the way to more gains, probably signaling a resumption of the rally. On the flip side, 1.2915 is the immediate support followed then by 1.2865/70 and then 1.2820. </p>
