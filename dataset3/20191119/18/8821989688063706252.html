      <h1>Harry Nilsson, ‘Losst and Founnd': Album Review</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T18:40:29+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 18:40</time> by <a rel="author">Michael Gallucci</a></address>
      <p>When <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/harry-nilsson/">Harry Nilsson</a> died of heart failure in January 1994 at age 52, he was recording songs for what would have been his first album since 1980. The music sat on the shelf unfinished for a quarter century before original producer Mark Hudson returned to the tapes to finally complete the record.</p>
      <p>The result of their work, <i>Losst and Founnd</i>, isn't a great lost Nilsson album, but there's plenty of now-poignant material here to make much of it seem, at last, like a proper goodbye.</p>
      <p>Back in 1974, when recording the infamous <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/harry-nilsson-pussy-cats/"><i>Pussy Cats</i></a> LP with pal <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/john-lennon/">John Lennon</a>, Nilsson blew out a vocal cord, an accident he never recovered from. Blessed with a three-and-a-half-octave range, the singer and songwriter climbed to some epic heights during the first part of his career. The new raspy howl fit <i>Pussy Cats</i>' rowdy rock 'n' roll, but subsequent records – like 1976's <i>Sandman</i> and the following year's <i>Knnillssonn</i> – were ill-suited to the rougher tones caused by the voice damage.</p>
      <p>And there's no getting around that on <i>Losst and Founnd</i>. No matter how hard he and Hudson worked at channeling the classic Nilsson formula found on albums like <i>Aerial Ballet</i> (1968) and <i><a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/harry-nilsson-schmilsson/">Nilsson Schmilsson</a></i> (1971), there's no returning to that angelic voice so brutally ravaged by the strains of the <i>Pussy Cats</i> sessions and years of hard living.</p>
      <p>The softer material is affected the most. "U.C.L.A." and "Love Is the Answer" – two of <i>Losst and Founnd</i>'s<i> </i>eight full originals – are buried in sentimental strings (the former) and a busy arrangement (the latter) that pretty much downgrade Nilsson to guest status. Not exactly the desired outcome on an album designed to celebrate the late artist's final work.</p>
      <p>He's better served on the title track, "Woman Oh Woman" and "Animal Farm," where Hudson tosses in horns, a sense of playfulness and even a Van Dyke Parks accordion on "Woman" that recall Nilsson's golden days without ever slipping into slick nostalgia. Covers of <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/yoko-ono/">Yoko Ono</a> and Jimmy Webb songs, as well as a medley that includes the oft-interpreted "Hi-Heel Sneakers," are also throwbacks to Nilsson's rich past. But what's up with "Try," a wobbly singalong that follows the Ono cut and borrows a little too liberally from "All You Need Is Love"?</p>
      <p>Still, it's great to hear this voice from the past one more time. Nilsson's later career was marked by some forgettable records, like his end-of-the-'70s string of RCA releases, the soundtrack to Robert Altman's 1980 bomb <i>Popeye</i> (though the album has developed a cult following over the years) and a record that originally wasn't even issued in the U.S. <i>Losst and Founnd </i>makes up for some of those missteps, while also committing a few of its own. It's not perfect, but neither was Harry Nilsson. In a way, it's a fitting, concluding tribute to one of popular music's most overlooked, and tragic, geniuses.</p>
      <h3>The '70s Very Best Rock Songs</h3>

      </figure>
      <h4>Rush, "2112" (1976)</h4>
      <p>A titanic 20-minute title track populated by crazy-good instrumental interludes, crazy-weird screeching and a sometimes plain-crazy what-if-they-banned-music theme, this is the most ambitious thing Rush ever did.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>Van Halen, "Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love" (1978)</h4>
      <p>Eddie Van Halen will always be known – and justifiably so – for his finger-popping pyrotechnics, but "Ain't Talking 'About Love" shows another side, as he experiments with an instrument you're unlikely to find in many hard-rock songs: The electric sitar.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>Free, "All Right Now" (1970)</h4>
      <p>Lost great Paul Kossoff provides a perfect foil for Paul Rodgers, as heard on this breakthrough song for Free. Unfortunately, his growing addictions led to a too-early band dissolution in 1973 – and, three years later, Kossoff was dead.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>Mott the Hoople, "All the Young Dudes" (1972)</h4>
      <p>David Bowie wrote and produced "All the Young Dudes" for Mott the Hoople, who suddenly catapulted to glam-rock royalty after years toiling as a lumbering British blues band. The makeover was sublime, and the song – a teen anthem for displaced kids – stands as their greatest achievement.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>Tom Petty, "American Girl" (1977)</h4>
      <p>"American Girl" wasn't a hit when it was pulled as the second single from Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers' debut album in 1977, but its stature has grown over the years thanks to its timeless appeal. Nervy with just a hint of nostalgia, the song sparks from the ringing notes that open it to the jammed fadeout.</p>

        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2015/10/American_Woman45NEEDSIZING.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>The Guess Who, "American Woman" (1970)</h4>
      <p>Fans have disputed for years whether "American Woman" is an indictment on the U.S. war machine of the Vietnam era (as well as other things). The Canadian band has even gone back and forth on its assessment. Either way, it's the Guess Who's best song and one their toughest.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>Sex Pistols, "Anarchy in the U.K." (1976)</h4>
      <p>The Sex Pistols' combustible introduction proved just how exciting punk rock could be in the right hands. From the ear-piercing guitar that launches the song to Johnny Rotten's pained howls that end it, "Anarchy in the U.K." is a milestone moment in '70s rock.</p>

        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2015/10/9_brick.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>Pink Floyd, "Another Brick in the Wall, Part II" (1979)</h4>
      <p>The biggest single of Pink Floyd's career is a crucial part of 'The Wall' narrative, where the education system breaks down and leaves the antihero adding another barrier to his emotional defense. This song's anti-authoritarian message (and an ersatz disco backbeat) clicked with fans, who sent it to No. 1.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>Jethro Tull, "Aqualung" (1971)</h4>
      <p>Ian Anderson's famously pervy lyric made this song famous, but listen closer as Martin Barre’s sawing guitar adds deeper complexities: That's what gives "Aqualung" its inherent danger, even as the strange, lonesome thoughts of this unforgettable outsider unfold.</p>

        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2015/10/The_Who_-_Baba_coverNEEDSSIZING.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>The Who, "Baba O'Riley" (1971)</h4>
      <p>From the opening keyboards that roll over into themselves about a dozen times over to the frenetic conclusion (complete with a viola solo), "Baba O'Riley" didn't sound like anything else on the radio at the time. In fact, this still sounds like it's in its own world.</p>
      <hr/>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2015/10/BabyEddieNEEDSIZING.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>Eddie Money, "Baby Hold On" (1978)</h4>
      <p>If you think there's nothing more to hear in this radio favorite, focus next time on Jo Baker. Doubling the lead vocal, save for a prototypical mid-song breakdown, the former Elvin Bishop band member helps underscore Money's latent hopefulness in the face of crushing adversity.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>Bruce Springsteen, "Backstreets" (1975)</h4>
      <p>Remember when albums had distinct halves? Back then, artists had to work not just at the necessary conciseness required of the vinyl product, but also to make bold statements that would begin and – to the point, with the anthemic "Backstreets" – end each side. There are few better than this gem from 'Born to Run.'</p>

        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2015/10/Ballroom_blitzNEEDSIZING.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>The Sweet, "Ballroom Blitz" (1973)</h4>
      <p>Inspired by an actual ballroom blitz – the Sweet were once forced from the stage in Scotland by a bottle-throwing crowd – this song appeared on 'Desolation Boulevard' in North America but never on any original, non-compilation U.K. album. Maybe the Scots should have been more welcoming.</p>

        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2015/10/15_run.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>Paul McCartney and Wings, "Band on the Run" (1974)</h4>
      <p>McCartney skillfully weaves his own desire to break away of the Beatles with the age-old myths of ne’er-do-wells, hitchhikers and outsiders, creating a unifying theme of escape that's more subtle (and thus more commercial) than any by ex-partner John Lennon. But no less powerful.</p>

        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2015/10/T.Rex_Get_It_On_single_coverNEEDSIZING.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>T. Rex, "Bang a Gong [Get It On]" (1971)</h4>
      <p>T. Rex's best-known song was Marc Bolan's nod to Chuck Berry, but somewhere along the way it became a glam-rock powerhouse, a glittering buzzing-guitar and honking-sax extravaganza. Over the years, "Bang a Gong (Get It On)' has become a cornerstone and influential rock number of the '70s.</p>

        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2015/10/Heart_-_BarracudaNEEDSIZING.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>Heart, "Barracuda" (1977)</h4>
      <p>That rolling riff is the force behind one of Heart's most timeless songs, but the sting doesn't stop there. Ann Wilson wrote the song after their record company hinted that she and Heart guitarist Nancy Wilson (her sister) were romantically involved. Heart never again sounded so pissed off.</p>

        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2015/10/rollingstonesbeastofBURDEN.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>Rolling Stones, "Beast of Burden" (1978)</h4>
      <p>One of the Rolling Stones' best songs of the '70s and one of their greatest mid-tempo cuts, "Beast of Burden" helped spur 1978's 'Some Girls,' a creative comeback for the band after a few dazed-and-confused years. Keith Richards wrote the bulk of the song, a reference in part to his drug problems from the decade.</p>

        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2015/10/Elton_John_-_Bennie_and_the_JetsNEEDSIZING.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>Elton John, "Bennie and the Jets" (1974)</h4>
      <p>'Goodbye Yellow Brick Road' is a monumental album in Elton John's career, and the faux-live "Bennie and the Jets" is a highlight, a piano-pounding No. 1 hit that pushed him a little out of his comfort zone. As John describes the fictional band at the center of the song, "Bennie" is weird and wonderful.</p>

        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2015/10/Black_Betty_Ram_JamNEEDSIZING.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>Ram Jam, "Black Betty" (1977)</h4>
      <p>The short-lived Ram Jam were credited on this boisterous update of an old field-holler blues – but it was actually a recording by the little-known Starstruck, featuring future Ram Jam member Bill Bartlett. Starstruck also included David Goldflies, later a sideman with Dickey Betts and the Allman Brothers.</p>
      <hr/>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2015/10/Kiss_first_album_coverNEEDSIZING.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>Kiss, "Black Diamond" (1974)</h4>
      <p>Principally composed by Paul Stanley, completed with a monstrous riff by Gene Simmons and sung by a succession of drummers beginning with Peter Criss, the episodic "Black Diamond" closed out Kiss' self-titled debut as one of the band's most impressive songwriting efforts.</p>
      <hr/>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2015/10/Black_Dog45NEEDSIZING.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>Led Zeppelin, "Black Dog" (1971)</h4>
      <p>The opening song on Led Zeppelin's best album barrels out of the gate like a horned-up animal on the prowl for some quick lovin'. The entire band shines – from John Bonham's titanic drum fills to Jimmy Page's strutting guitar. And Robert Plant reaches orgasmic heights just when you expect him to.</p>
      <hr/>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2015/10/23black.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>Santana, "Black Magic Woman" (1970)</h4>
      <p>Carlos Santana’s sinewy riff gets all the notice, but Gregg Rolie’s darkly mysterious keyboard signature, not to mention his raw and emotional vocal, is what whisks this old Fleetwood Mac song to an entirely new place.</p>
      <hr/>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2015/10/manfredmannNEEDSIZING.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>Manfred Mann, "Blinded by the Light" (1977)</h4>
      <p>Manfred Mann, who had a No. 1 hit in 1964 with "Do Wah Diddy Diddy," and his '70s group took a stripped-down tongue twister from Bruce Springsteen's debut album and turned it into a big rock epic, scoring another No. 1 along the way. We like Springsteen's version, but this one is better.</p>
      <hr/>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2015/10/Ramones_-_Blitzkrieg_Bop_coverNEEDSIZING.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>Ramones, "Blitzkrieg Bop" (1976)</h4>
      <p>The opening blast on the Ramones' debut album still sounds like a buzzsaw cutting through rock 'n' roll excess. Inspired as much by bubblegum pop music as '60s garage rock, "Blitzkrieg Bop" ushered in a whole new era of economy-sized guitar music in the '70s.</p>
      <hr/>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2015/10/Bohemian_RhapsodyNEEDSIZING.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>Queen, "Bohemian Rhapsody" (1975)</h4>
      <p>Rock music was all kinds of ambitious in the '70s. Checking in at the very top of the list is Queen's masterpiece of pomposity, bombast and brilliance. It slips into about a half-dozen different forms during its six minutes, including rock, opera, classical and outer-space pop.</p>
      <hr/>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2015/10/BorntorunsingleNEEDSIZING.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>Bruce Springsteen, "Born to Run" (1975)</h4>
      <p>Springsteen wanted to write an epic song for his third album, one that captured the lyrical and musical scope found on hit records by Phil Spector in the '60s. With "Born to Run" he created an anthem for losers, tramps and anyone else stuck in dead-end lives. He discovered salvation, if not exactly escape, in the groove.</p>

        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2015/10/Theboysarebackthinlizzy.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>Thin Lizzy, "The Boys are Back in Town" (1976)</h4>
      <p>Thin Lizzy's best-known song and biggest hit is a little bit Springsteen, a little bit Irish swagger and a whole lotta killer guitar riff. Phil Lynott sings like a man teetering among fear, nostalgia and bluster while the band's twin-guitar attack stabs from all directions.</p>
      <hr/>

        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2015/10/Dark_Side_of_the_MoonNEEDSIZING.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>Pink Floyd, "Brain Damage" (1973)</h4>
      <p>A song that gave 'Dark Side of the Moon' its name also hints at longer meditations to come on Pink Floyd co-founder Syd Barrett's mental state. Specifically, the line "and if the band you're in starts playing different tunes" refers to scattered late-period performances that saw their former frontman singing the wrong lyrics on stage.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>Pretenders, "Brass in Pocket" (1979)</h4>
      <p>Chrissie Hynde wasn't fooling around on this early Pretenders single, declaring herself "special" and pretty much demanding your undivided attention. The band's self-titled debut is filled with tart and chewy nuggets. "Brass in Pocket" plays it both ways.</p>
      <hr/>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://townsquare.media/site/295/files/2015/10/TP_-_Breakdown_singleNEEDSIZING.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <h4>Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, "Breakdown" (1976)</h4>
      <p>This sounds like a song recorded in the middle of the night, because it was. Petty heard something in a guitar part by Mike Campbell during the playback of a much longer earlier version, and called everyone in to re-record "Breakdown" around that lick.</p>
      <hr/>

      </figure>
      <h4>Simon and Garfunkel, "Bridge Over Troubled Water" (1970)</h4>
      <p>Paul Simon's masterpiece is one long build-up, from the curtain-raising piano on the intro to the cascading drums that bring it to a close. Art Garfunkel never soared as high as he does on "Bridge Over Troubled Water," simultaneously delivering one of his most restrained and virtuosic performances.</p>
      <hr/>

      </figure>
      <h4>Rolling Stones, "Brown Sugar" (1971)</h4>
      <p>The Rolling Stones' nasty, bluesy romp paints a perfect portrait of where they were in 1971. Bottom line: on top of the world and able to do anything they damn well pleased, including recording a song about a forced interracial relationship between a slave owner and one of his slaves.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>Bad Company, "Can't Get Enough" (1974)</h4>
      <p>There's an interesting transformation here, as Paul Rodgers moves from boastful braggart to pleading lover, that always gave Bad Company's biggest hit this great drama. A crack band featuring members of Free, Mott the Hoople and King Crimson match Rodgers' spectacular vocal performance stride for stride, too.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>Van Morrison, "Caravan" (1970)</h4>
      <p>Van Morrison makes turning up the radio into an article of faith, something that ratifies the song even as it moves the listener toward something that feels like salvation. Or, as in the case of his performance of "Caravan" as part of 'The Last Waltz,' toward a series of pretty mean leg kicks.</p>

      <h4>Kansas, "Carry On Wayward Son" (1976)</h4>
      <p>Kerry Livgren brought this track in at the last minute, during a period when Kansas was polishing up songs that would make up 'Leftoverture.' Not only did they reshuffle their plans, 'Carry On' moved to the lead-song spot, even as it hinted at Livgren's later turn toward Christian rock.</p>

      <h4>Ted Nugent, "Cat Scratch Fever" (1977)</h4>
      <p>Nugent was so proud of his lip-smacking double entendre here that he took a then-rare turn at the mic, replacing regular vocalist Derek St. Holmes. Good thing: A Top 40 hit, "Cat Scratch Fever" has become one of Nugent's must-play concert favorites.</p>

      <h4>David Bowie, "Changes" (1972)</h4>
      <p>Even before his career took off, David Bowie was giving a glimpse of his future, singing about change in a voice that sounded an awful lot like a certain rock 'n' roll troubadour from Mars. After a few stumbling years, Bowie found his voice on 1971's 'Hunky Dory.' "Changes" is his coming-out party.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>ZZ Top, "Cheap Sunglasses" (1979)</h4>
      <p>There's a reason this sounds so raggedly nonchalant. Billy Gibbons wrote the lyrics – all three verses – on a road trip from the Gulf Coast up to Austin. Then ZZ Top recorded it using a found-object 200-watt Marshall with a blown tube.</p>

      <h4>Doobie Brothers, "China Grove" (1973)</h4>
      <p>Tom Johnston returned to his favorite little shuffle on "China Grove." What drove the song into classic status was guest Bill Payne's cool-rocking boogie piano. Payne also inspired the lyrics for a song that was originally titled "Parliament," after Johnson's brand of smokes.</p>

      <p>Eric Clapton got this song from JJ Cale, whose swamp-rock style and songs would appear frequently throughout Clapton's career. It became one of his signature cuts, complete with a bluesy guitar solo, after appearing on the 'Slowhand' album in 1977.</p>

      <h4>Styx, "Come Sail Away" (1977)</h4>
      <p>Sort of like a time-capsule for Styx's schizophrenic original era, "Come Sail Away" has it all: An opening segment focused on Dennis DeYoung’s Broadway-style affectations then a blast of J.Y.-fueled proto-arena rock bombast, with a proggish synth solo to make it complete.</p>

      <p>Neil Young's 1975 epic is like a mini history lesson about a ruthless soldier and explorer who helped Spain conquer Mexico in the 16th century. But its stalking rhythm and killer guitar make it way more exciting than anything you'd read in a book on the same subject.</p>

      <p>Nancy Wilson says she patterned the fleet acoustic riff here on the Moody Blues' "Question," but there was little else on Heart's debut U.S. single that wasn't entirely original – right down to the Vietnam-era subtext for its night-of-passion theme.</p>

      <h4>Van Halen, "Dance the Night Away" (1979)</h4>
      <p>One of the few moments conceived in the studio during the sessions for 'Van Halen II,' this track was the first indication of the band's previously untapped mainstream pop prowess: "Dance the Night Away," goosed along by Eddie's inventive tap solo, became Van Halen's first Top 20 hit song.</p>

      <p>A sarcastic take on your basic torch song, Steely Dan set a new standard for suave detachment on "Deacon Blues" – then completed things by adding a soulful turn by guest saxophonist Pete Christlieb from the 'Tonight Show' band. (That's him on "FM," too.)</p>

      <p>Though it begins more like a Santana song (thanks to the liberal use of Latin percussion) and Denny Dias is featured on an odd-ball sitar solo, the theme from "Do It Again" – people tend to succumb to their worst impulses – would be one Steely Dan returned to time and again.</p>

      <p>After about one billion radio plays, it's easy to forget how conceptually gutsy this was in its moment.

      <p>Browne's first big single was unusual for the deeply introspective, typically first-person singer-songwriter. Thankfully, he welcomed outside input (from the label exec who suggested a more hopeful narrative to the vocal addendums from David Crosby and Graham Nash), and "Doctor My Eyes" jump started his career.</p>

      <p>A punchy tribute to early hero Fats Domino, this tune had been banging around in Morrison's head for years. In fact, he'd made passes at it – usually in much longer form – during sessions in 1968 and '69. Finally, the following year, he nailed it, and "Domino" became Morrison's highest-ever charting U.S. hit.</p>

      <p>ELO's biggest U.S. hit was more straightforward than the heavily orchestrated, Beatlesque pop songs that helped steer their career throughout the '70s. With a stomping beat (actually a tape loop slowed down from another song on the same album), "Don't Bring Me Down" sounded like a decade coming to a close.</p>

      <p>These days, "(Don't Fear) The Reaper" is known as the cowbell song from a famous 'Saturday Night Live' sketch, but Blue Oyster Cult's ode to the inevitability of death remains one of the '70s' best cuts, a Top 15 hit with a killer guitar riff and style to spare.</p>

      <p>Thought to have been a reference to drugs, this platinum-selling No. 2 hit for Foreigner was initially inspired by a trip Lou Gramm and Mick Jones made to see the New York Rangers play hockey. Their goalie left the game with double vision after suffering a concussion.</p>

      <p>Aerosmith's eternal "Dream On" was their first hit in 1973 (though it became an even bigger hit three years later when it was re-released following the success of 'Toys in the Attic'). It's since become a paragon of power ballads, a lighter-in-the-air staple that proved that slowing things down doesn't necessarily mean going soft.</p>

      <h4>Fleetwood Mac, "Dreams" (1977)</h4>
      <p>Memorably cinematic, and propelled by the real-life scandals within the band, 'Rumours' chronicled with a lush directness (quite literally, it turned out) the way that relationships coalesce then dissolve. That's perhaps best heard on this quietly effective kiss-off song.</p>

      <p>We get it, technically this isn't a song. But, when you're Eddie Van Halen, even your warm up exercises are eye popping enough to make the final track listing. Van Halen was getting ready for a weekend gig when this came forth. Engineer Donn Landee captured it on tape, and a solo that would inspire countless future guitarists – for better or worse – was born.</p>

      <p>Written and recorded as the sessions for 'Face the Music' were coming to a close, "Evil Woman" became ELO's second U.S. Top 10 single even as it made clear (with an overt nod toward "Fixing a Hole") just how deep mastermind Jeff Lynne's creative connection was to the Beatles.</p>

      <p>Bad Company had love on their mind a lot in the '70s ("Can't Get Enough," "Good Lovin' Gone Bad"). But they were never as horned up as they were on this hit from the band's second album, 'Straight Shooter.' Powered by a guitar riff that cuts through the chorus, "Feel Like Makin' Love" is '70s rock at its carnal best.</p>

      <p>For composer Neil Peart, this song represents the beginning of his life as an adult, when he took his first airplane ride away from home. It's much the same for fans, as "Fly by Night" serves as the title track from the album that changed everything for the newly reformulated Rush.</p>

      <h4>Boston, "Foreplay / Long Time" (1976)</h4>
      <p>This song is many things. A terrific two-part introduction to Boston. A shining example of their marriage of heavy rock and prog. A moment of fizzy inventiveness for Tom Scholz, as he created synth-like swoops with a pick on his strings – but not, strictly speaking, of Scholz's guitar prowess. That's Barry Goudreau on the solos.</p>

      <p>"What song is it you wanna hear?" Whether you prefer the epic 13-minute live version or the original nine-minute, but no less epic, studio take, Lynyrd Skynyrd's immortal power ballad/rock anthem remains one of radio's most durable songs. More than 40 years later, it remains a defining moment in classic rock history.</p>

      <p>Elton begins an album of such epic sweep with a suitably grandiose suite of songs, but makes the bold choice to go with a surprisingly dark theme. His initial instrumental segment – written, Elton has said, when he began contemplating what music should be played at his own funeral – segues fluidly into an emotional meditation on the dying of a relationship.</p>

"Funk #49" appeared on the James Gang's sophomore release, following "Funk #48" from their debut. There was a "Funk #50" too, but not until Walsh's 2012 solo album 'Analog Man.'</p>

When the wronged man reached for something in his boot, Van Zant supposedly uttered the title of this song – adding, "If you're going to shoot me, it's going to be in the ass or the elbows."</p>

      <p>By the time Fleetwood Mac released 'Rumours' in 1977, the band's various couples were splintering, and with three personal singer-songwriters at the fore, there was no way their dirty laundry would go unaired. Lindsey Buckingham's brutal, biting "Go Your Own Way" stings the hardest.</p>

      <p>"Son of a Bitch" was reportedly the title they had picked out for both this song and the platinum-selling 1975 album from which it came, but Nazareth's label flatly refused.

      <p>Blondie transformed themselves from a New Wave band with a serious jones for '60s girl groups to a disco powerhouse thanks to this No. 1 hit from their excellent third album, 1978's 'Parallel Lines.' There's still plenty of punk muscle behind that beat too.</p>

      <p>AC/DC's breakthrough moment and one of the great rock 'n' roll songs of the late '70s, "Highway to Hell" was defiant, determined and powered up to do some damage on its way out.

      <p>John Lennon's universal call for peace also served as the title track from his first solo No. 1 LP. More than 40 years (and countless cover versions) later, "Imagine" stands as one of the most defining anthems of the era – utopian, naive, controversial and hopeful.</p>

      <p>This appropriately named tune was recorded the same day it was written. Alan White's signature drum contributions were completely improvised, as well. Released just 10 days later, “Instant Karma” peaked at No. 3 in the U.S. as the Beatles’ “Let It Be” was rising to the top of the charts.</p>

      <p>Ozzy Osbourne thought this song's monster riff sounded like a walking, giant iron man, so the group built a sci-fi fable around the concept. "Iron Man" is the centerpiece of Black Sabbath's second album, 'Paranoid,' and a cornerstone track in the foundation of heavy metal.</p>

      <p>Plenty of bands have played at being tough, but Thin Lizzy always had a visceral kind of abandon. As their flinty twin-guitar attack worked in perfect concert with Phil Lynott's dark whispers, it tended to make Thin Lizzy's big talk feel decidedly real. "Jailbreak" is a great example, maybe the best.</p>

      <p>Miller self-mythologized himself here – running down his various guises over the years – and launched a whole new career as a No. 1 pop artist. His earlier blues records always sort of got lost in the mix of similar-sounding sides; on "The Joker," Miller reveals a sexy swagger that sent him barreling up the charts.</p>

      <p>Eric Clapton was pining for pal George Harrison's wife something bad when he rounded up a group of musicians for a one-shot group called Derek and the Dominos.

      <p>AC/DC share a different kind of creation story here, the one that – with a combining of white and black music traditions – spawned a dangerous youngster dubbed rock 'n' roll. Angus Young then procedes to tear his guitar apart on a song that started out at 6 minutes but can go three times as long in concert.</p>

      <h4>The Eagles, "Life in the Fast Lane" (1976)</h4>
      <p>This song is often misconstrued as a celebration of the very lifestyle choices it's criticizing. Even Joe Walsh, who came up with the opening riff while rehearsing, failed to fully grasp the message – at least at first. He finally downshifted in 1994, just in time for an Eagles reunion.</p>

      <p>Released a couple of years after "Life in the Fast Lane," and with a similar title, Walsh's "Life's Been Good" takes an entirely different approach. The song again lands a series of sharp jabs at the bloated excess of stardom, but brilliantly couches it this time with Joe's unique brand of humor.</p>

      <p>One of the biggest James Bond theme songs, and also a huge hit for Wings, "Live and Let Die" sounds like the sum of its parts. It's unmistakably 007, but it's also a flashy McCartney rocker from the era, recorded as he was gearing up for 'Band on the Run.'</p>

      <p>ELO's highest-ever charting U.K. single at the time, this track really must be heard within the larger context of 'New World Record.'

      <p>A chugging, metallic riff – added by Ian Anderson himself to mimic the passing of a night train – drives home this chillingly prophetic indictment of over population. And, all along, the song is building (relentlessly, improbably) towards popular music’s most distinctive flute solo.</p>

      <p>McCartney's solo debut is mostly a collection of demos, song fragments and off-the-cuff musical observations. "Maybe I'm Amazed" is its one classic cut and the launching of a career outside of the world-conquering band that made him famous. Everything good and bad about post-Beatles McCartney pretty much stems from this song.</p>

      <p>Don Felder's arrival is immediately felt, as he arranges the unforgettable bass and guitar signature for this chart-topping Henley-Frey smash. Then Felder launches into a searing solo – one that perfectly underscores the song's bitter sense of missed opportunities.</p>

      <p>In a sign of what was directly ahead of the disintegrating Faces, neither Ronnie Lane nor Rod Stewart could agree on this song – so Ron Wood sang it. Within two years, Lane had left for Humble Pie, Stewart was more focused on a solo career and Wood had joined the Rolling Stones.</p>

      <p>Like the earlier “Ramble On,” in that it features these whooshing transitions from furious folk strumming to Plant screeching over a crunchy riff, but better constructed: This may be Led Zeppelin’s most addictive hook.</p>

      <h4>Meat Loaf, "Paradise by the Dashboard Light" (1977)</h4>
      <p>If this sounds something like 'Born to Run' on steroids, there's a reason for that. Actually, a few. Composer Jim Steinman has said he found inspiration in Bruce Springsteen's soaring tales of every-day angst. He and Meatloaf also had two members of the E Street Band in the studio, Roy Bittan and Max Weinberg.</p>

      <h4>Black Sabbath, "Paranoid" (1970)</h4>
      <p>In sharp contrast to just about every other Black Sabbath song we love, "Paranoid" clocks in at an economical three minutes and its melody can almost be called pop. But that chunky riff, somewhere between metal and punk, and those lyrics (<i>"I tell you to enjoy life / I wish I could, but it's too late"</i>) are far from it.</p>

      <p>Billy Joel's autobiographical song wasn't quite the big breakthrough he wanted in 1973, but it got him back on track after a couple of stalled starts earlier in the decade. The characters were based on real people Joel met while making ends meet as a lounge singer for a brief spell in L.A. He soon returned to his native New York to stake his claim.</p>

      <p>Golden Earring's 'Moontan' was more than just the home to this anthemic Top 20 hit. It also served as inspiration for the titanic riff behind the title track from 1973's 'Sabbath Bloody Sabbath,' snapping Tony Iommi out of a crushing bout of writers block.</p>

      <p>Still reeling from the death of guitarist Duane Allman, the band regrouped, tightened up and made one of its warmest, coziest albums. The highlight is Dickey Betts' "Ramblin' Man," a country jam that shot to the top of the chart. It helped give the Allmans their only No. 1 album.</p>

      <p>With lyrics written in a rush of anger at Petty's record label – they were trying to sell his contract to someone else – "Refugee" turned into a long slog, once the Heartbreakers tried to get a finished version down to tape. Guitarist Mike Campbell has said they might have done 100 takes before getting the hit version.</p>

      <p>A highlight of the Doors' return to bluesier sounds on 'Morrison Hotel,' this gritty track features not one but two special guests beyond the band's core members. John Sebastian of Lovin' Spoonful fame played harmonica, while blues great Lonnie Mack is on bass.</p>

      <p>Kiss' timeless rock 'n' roll anthem has turned on generations with its simple but effective message. And as long as there are kids out there looking for a good time, it will never go out of style. All the basics are covered in three blissful minutes of guitars, drums and a singalong chorus that reaches for the sky.</p>

      <p>This amped-up love song, powered by a Led Zeppelin-inspired cadence, should have been Montrose's big break. Instead, their ultimately very influential debut stalled at a paltry No. 133 in the U.S., and one album later frontman Sammy Hagar – who still sings this song as a solo act – had split.</p>

      <p>Like David Bowie's "Space Oddity," "Rocket Man" takes the public's fascination with space travel in the late '60s and early '70s and brings it back down to earth. In this case, being an astronaut is just another job. Bernie Taupin's lyrics get to the mundane heart of the matter; Elton John's music brings it home.</p>

      <p>This standout track from 1973's 'The Smoker You Drink, The Player You Get,' with lyrics inspired by Walsh's move to Colorado after splitting with the James Gang, made use of the talkbox well before Peter Frampton – though Frampton's "Do You Feel Like We Do" is somehow more famous for it.</p>

      <h4>Yes, "Roundabout" (1972)</h4>
      <p>“Roundabout” was a showcase for Jon Anderson’s unique brand of crystalline psychedelia, Steve Howe’s country-influenced virtuosity and the first flowerings of Rick Wakeman’s keyboard genius. The lyric, meanwhile, has come to symbolize progressive rock’s memorable flights of fancy.</p>

      <h4>The Police, "Roxanne" (1978)</h4>
      <p>The world's introduction to the Police remains one of their finest moments, a reggae-inflected pop song about a lovestruck man and the prostitute he's smitten with. Not exactly the sort of thing you'd expect to hear in the Top 40 in the late '70s, but Sting brings warmth to even the seediest of subjects (see "Every Breath You Take").</p>

      <p>Even though Jackson Browne wasn't even 30 years old when he recorded "Running on Empty," he sings as if he's been stuck in some middle-aged crisis for years. Browne looks back on his life with a sense of both yearning and defeat, much of it no doubt spurred by the 'Running on Empty' album's theme of being a road-weary rock star.</p>

      <p>Neither James Williamson's ruthless maelstrom of guitar nor the song's tough-guy Vietnam-era lingo can obscure the desperate longing at the heart of "Search and Destroy." Iggy Pop and company manage to hit you in the heart, and the nuts, at the same time.</p>

      <p>A heartbreaking, brutally honest track, "She's Gone" wasn’t a hit until it was rereleased two years later, after Hall and Oates charted with “Sara Smile.” The tune then shot to No. 7 on the Billboard charts, and has since become a concert staple.</p>

      <p>The ultimate guitar riff is so defining and overwhelming that the story within the classic song gets lost among the crunch.

      <p>The Faces' biggest U.S. hit, co-written by Rod Stewart and Ron Wood, gives us a peek inside this band's legend-producing debauchery. While Stewart winks his way into a one-night stand, Wood unleashes a sneering slide guitar that gives it just the right amount of booze-soaked swagger.</p>

      <p>Sung by Derek St. Holmes – except for "sometimes you wanna get higher" – and co-written by the uncredited Rob Grange, "Stranglehold" nevertheless becomes quintessential Nugent on the strength of an eight-minute guitar solo that he recorded in a single blistering take.</p>

      <p>Dire Straits' debut single sounded like little else on rock radio in 1978, with clean, piercing guitar and a vaguely Dylanesque vocal guiding the way.

      <p>Lynyrd Skynyrd wrote "Sweet Home Alabama" as a response to a pair of Neil Young songs, but it's evolved into a Southern anthem. Whatever you take from the song, there's no denying the titanic groove that fuels it and the sincerity behind the swing.</p>

      <h4>Bachman-Turner Overdrive, "Takin' Care of Business" (1973)</h4>
      <p>Three chords and a catchy phrase was all Bachman-Turner Overdrive needed to finally crack the U.S. Top 20. Well, and a pizza. When BTO found themselves in need of a piano player for the track, they used Norman Durkee, who happened to deliver a pie to the studio.</p>

      <h4>Bob Dylan, Tangled Up in Blue" (1975)</h4>
      <p>Bob Dylan's breakup opus 'Blood on the Tracks' remains his best work since his legendary mid-'60s run. "Tangled Up in Blue" is the opening cut and one of Dylan's all-time greatest songs. It's a bit more abstract than most of the album's straightforward (and autobiographical) numbers, but it sets the tone magnificently.</p>

      <h4>Bruce Springsteen, "Thunder Road" (1975)</h4>
      <p>Is there a better album-opening song in the '70s than "Thunder Road"? In less than five minutes, Bruce Springsteen sets the mood and narrative for everything that follows on his masterpiece and breakthrough album 'Born to Run.' Spine-tingling brilliance.</p>

      <h4>Elton John, "Tiny Dancer" (1971)</h4>
      <p>"Tiny Dancer" was always one of Elton John's best songs, but it took the 2000 movie 'Almost Famous' to give this track a new life. In a little more than six minutes, Elton builds from spare piano ballad to a big pop moment, complete with strings and choir. Forty-five years later, it still bustles with life.</p>

      <h4>The Clash, "Train in Vain" (1979)</h4>
      <p>Originally tacked onto the end of 'London Calling' because nobody was really sure if it fit in with the rest of the album, "Train in Vain" became the Clash's first U.S. hit and the chewy pop nugget that capped their masterpiece. Chugging along like a speeding locomotive, the song is all about love and its runaway frustrations.</p>

      <h4>The Rolling Stones, "Tumbling Dice" (1972)</h4>
      <p>The Rolling Stones' masterpiece 'Exile on Main St.' is best heard in full, as a 67-minute album that unspools its dark tales of depravity buried in druggy mudiness. But "Tumbling Dice" sounds equally as inviting on the radio, a hook-fueled rump shaker that captures the Stones at their '70s peak.</p>

      <h4>Bob Seger, "Turn the Page" (1973)</h4>
      <p>Bob Seger's ode to the road is as weary as the song's narrator. Seger wasn't yet a star when he recorded this look at the other side of a touring musician's curtain, but it was only a matter of time. As "Turn the Page" makes clear, he had already seen a few ups and many downs.</p>

      <h4>ZZ Top, "Tush" (1975)</h4>
      <p>Every part of the still-emerging ZZ Top's recipe for success is here: "Tush" is a boiling pot of greasy blues, backwoods twang and tough Texas blues, finished off with a splash of lip-smacking salaciousness.</p>

      <h4>Lou Reed, "Walk on the Wild Side" (1972)</h4>
      <p>Reed pulled quite a feat here, getting a song about crossdressers, junkies and blowjobs in the Top 40. It was familiar ground for him, at least lyrically. But "Walk on the Wild Side," like the rest of the 'Transformer' album it came from, revealed a new-found fascination with polished pop sounds and AM-radio hooks, all thanks to producer David Bowie.</p>

      <h4>Aerosmith, "Walk This Way" (1975)</h4>
      <p>That strutting guitar riff is as much a part of its era as it is timeless. No surprise that Joe Perry and Steven Tyler hooked up with Run-D.M.C. for a hip-hop cover in the mid-'80s that helped re-ignite their career. The song – and that riff! – are just that transcendent.</p>

      <h4>Genesis, "Watcher of the Skies" (1972)</h4>
      <p>The lyrics were inspired by Arthur C. Clarke's 'Childhood's End,' a 1953 science fiction novel which also sparked songs by Pink Floyd and Van Der Graaf Generator. But that Mellotron was all Genesis, as co-author Tony Banks coaxed world-vibrating sounds out of an old Mark 2.</p>

      <h4>Queen, "We Will Rock You" (1977)</h4>
      <p>Queen's one-two punch starts with one of the band's greatest achievements: a foot-stomping, percussion-fueled chant that erupts into a firestorm of Brian May guitar pyrotechnics. The following "We Are the Champions" is no less monumental, a stadium-sized ballad that singer Freddie Mercury excelled at.</p>

      <h4>Grand Funk Railroad, "We're An American Band" (1973)</h4>
      <p>For Grand Funk's Don Brewer, "We're an American Band" was a reflection of who they were – nothing more or less. "It was a true description," he said, "and it kind of rolled off my mind." Scenes from their tour in support of 'The Phoenix Album' completed this song.</p>

      <h4>Warren Zevon, "Werewolves of London" (1978)</h4>
      <p>Zevon’s version of the old black-and-white movie prowler is a smooth operator, when not ripping out the lungs of unsuspecting passersby: Even after engorging on chow mein, then knocking back an island libation or two, the beast’s “hair was perfect.”</p>

      <h4>The Doobie Brothers, "What a Fool Believes" (1978)</h4>
      <p>Michael McDonald brought a whole new level of songcraft to the Doobie Brothers' riff-driven bar rock. With "What a Fool Believes" he achieved his masterpiece, a sublime pop single with an R&amp;B backbone that shot to No. 1 and influenced half of what you heard on the radio for the next 18 months.</p>

      <h4>George Harrison, "What Is Life" (1970)</h4>
      <p>This towering rocker actually seemed to warrant producer Phil Spector’s typical Wall of Sound approach. Background vocals are credited to the George O’Hara-Smith singers – really Bobby Whitlock and Eric Clapton, who would go on to form Derek and the Dominos.</p>

      <h4>Journey, "Wheel in the Sky" (1978)</h4>
      <p>New frontman Steve Perry shouldn't get all the credit for this catalyst song from Journey’s first-ever million-selling LP. Former singer Robert Fleishman co-wrote three of the 'Infinity' project's very best moments, including "Anytime," "Winds of March" and, yes, "Wheel in the Sky."</p>

      <h4>The Allman Brothers Band, "Whipping Post" (1971)</h4>
      <p>An economical five-minute studio version of "Whipping Post" appears on the Allman Brothers' self-titled 1969 debut, but the real action unfolds on the dizzying 22-minute live take found on the classic 'At Fillmore East' album. It twists, turns and somehow ends back where it started in one of the most extraordinary stage performances ever recorded.</p>

      <h4>The Who, "Who Are You" (1978)</h4>
      <p>The Who's last great single, from their final album with Keith Moon, sounds like a classic Who single – from the gurgling synths that open the song to the powerhouse rhythm that drives it. Everyone's in top form (especially Roger Daltrey, giving one of his best vocal performances) for one final charge.</p>

      <h4>Creedence Clearwater Revival, "Who'll Stop the Rain" (1970)</h4>
      <p>One of John Fogerty's most powerful, and timeless, songs, "Who'll Stop the Rain" encapsulated the dawning of a new decade by looking back on the tragedies of the one before it. It's easy to read Vietnam in the lyrics, as well as a swipe at post-Woodstock complacency, but there's just as much anger as there is defeat.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>The Rolling Stones, "Wild Horses" (1971)</h4>
      <p>Finally, a no-kidding country song from a band that always had this kind of unvarnished emotion running somewhere beneath its surface tough-guy attitude. Before, the Stones had been prone to wink and nudge their way through. Not this time, and the results are devastatingly powerful.</p>

      <p>Van Morrison takes on Stax-style R&amp;B, with hot-shot guitarist Ronnie Montrose filling the estimable role of Steve Cropper. Producer Ted Templeman would later work with another Van – Van Halen, that is.</p>

      <h4>Pink Floyd, "Wish You Were Here" (1975)</h4>
      <p>This song is not, as the myth holds, simply a tribute to Pink Floyd’s departed frontman Syd Barrett. Instead, it's a requiem for a group slowly drifting apart. Those larger ideas dovetailed perfectly, however, with a lost figure from their past – and a melancholy moment of greatness followed.</p>

      <h4>The Who, "Won't Get Fooled Again" (1971)</h4>
      <p>Going big was nothing new for the Who (see 'The Who Sell Out,' 'Tommy,' etc.), but the closing track from 'Who's Next' takes things to another level. Rolling synthesizer opening, 'Animal Farm' references, Roger Daltrey's most epic vocal performance – all packed into eight and a half minutes of rock 'n' roll fury.</p>

      <h4>Bachman-Turner Overdrive, "You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet" (1974)</h4>
      <p>BTO's only No. 1 started as a joke, with a stuttering chorus poking fun at Randy Bachman's brother, who also happened to be the band's first manager. But that chorus was something special, esepcially with that crunchy guitar riff accompanying it.</p>

      <h4>Rod Stewart, "You Wear It Well" (1972)</h4>
      <p>It's pretty much a rewrite of "Maggie May," but so what? Stewart's breakthrough single is one of the '70s' great rock 'n' roll moments, so this victory lap is earned. Besides, there are some new twists to "You Wear It Well," particularly a spry fiddle that follows the band through every jubiliant turn.</p>

      <h4>David Bowie, "Ziggy Stardust" (1972)</h4>
      <p>The centerpiece of David Bowie's greatest album serves as a denouement for the 'Ziggy Stardust' saga, the moment that brings the otherworldly rock star back down to Earth in a flaming ball of wires and ego. In a way, it's also Bowie's story turbocharged through the cosmos, ready for whatever the decade offered him.</p>
