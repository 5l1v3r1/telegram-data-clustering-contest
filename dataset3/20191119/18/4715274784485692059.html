      <p>What happens when you watch a TV series that opens with a detective waking up with a gun in his hand, a female detective’s dead body next to him, and no memory of how he ended up in that situation? How about a family drama wherein the lead character is a 31-year-old unemployed man who lives off his mother like a parasite and is badgered by his sister to make something out of his life?</p>

      <p>Both have interesting storylines that can pique the curiosity of Filipino viewers, and it is for this reason that GEM brings the compelling Japanese action drama <i>Nippon Noir</i> and family drama <i>If Talking Paid</i></p>
      <p> to Philippine TV.</p>
      <p>An all-Japanese TV channel from Sony Pictures Television and Nippon TV’s joint venture, GEM offers premium Japanese entertainment across Asia and gives Filipinos the front-row seat to the best of Japanese programming.</p>
      <p>Starring popular Japanese actors <b>Kento Kaku </b>and <b>Ryoko Hirosue</b>, <i>Nippon Noir</i></p>
      <p> is a riveting journey of humanity and the quest for justice as the story explores the mystery behind a billion-yen robbery and a possible murder setup that has turned a detective’s friends into foes after evidences are destroyed and the ensuing cover-up traps the protagonist in a web of lies and deceit.</p>
      <p>“It’s an interesting story and there’s nothing cliché or typical about it. I play the character of Kaoru Usui, who is found dead right at the beginning of episode 1. And though I think I’ve played a lot of dead characters already, it’s quite impactful this time,” explained Ryoko Hirosue, who admits that she finds her first time acting in a cop drama in <i>Nippon Noir</i></p>
      <p> very challenging. </p>
      <p>Lead actor Kento Kaku disclosed that he was very happy when he found out about <i>Nippon Noir</i></p>
      <p> and that he was chosen to star in it. “After listening to the producer’s detailed vision and after reading the script, I have no doubt that this will be a drama that is unprecedented in Japan. I believe this is a work that will express our desire and appetite for good stories. What is justice? What is humanity? I hope you can stay with us till the very end,” he shared.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, <i>If Talking Paid</i> stars <b>Toma Ikuta</b></p>
      <p> as an unemployed adult who lives with his mother and pesters her for money. In this drama, viewers get to witness the constant bickering of family members – a common scenario even among Filipino households.</p>
      <p>“We’re glad to know that Filipinos get to watch Japanese dramas on GEM. I hope they enjoy <i>If Talking Paid</i></p>
      <p>. This drama tries to break the mold as well, so I’m excited about it. I can see myself in the character of Mitsuru Kishibe. I also tend to go about my day with unkempt and messy hair. You could say that I’ve been preparing for this role my whole life,” Toma Ikuta quipped.</p>
      <p>Catch GEM’s new episodes of “Nippon Noir” every Wednesday at 9:00 p.m. and <i>If Talking Paid</i></p>
      <p> every Monday at 10:00 p.m., both on the same week as Japan.</p>
      <p>GEM, your destination for the best of Japanese entertainment, is available on SKYcable Ch 116 in Metro Manila; SKYcable Ch 222 in Cebu, Davao, Bacolod, Iloilo, and Baguio; GSAT Ch 57; and various provincial cable operators nationwide.</p>
