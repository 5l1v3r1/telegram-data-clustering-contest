        <b>Portugal's Central de Cervejas (SCC) brewing company announced on Tuesday that it has invested €1.4 million in the installation of 6,300 photovoltaic panels at its Vialonga brewery and in the of Água de Luso bottle filling plant in Mealhada.</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to the information published in a statement, the group installed "3,150 panels at its Vialonga plant and 3,150 at the Água de Luso filling plant in Mealhada, with an installed capacity of one megawatt peak (MWp) at each unit, which represented a global investment of €1.4 million".</p>
      <p>This project is part of the company's sustainability programme and aims to produce 2,845 megawatt hours of solar energy a year and reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by about 1,200 tonnes a year, "the equivalent to the annual capture of CO2 by 53,000 trees," the company explained.</p>
      <p>The director of Communication and Institutional Relations of SCC, Nuno Pinto de Magalhães, said "the reduction of energy consumption and CO2 emissions involves a focus on renewable energy, but also with indicators defined in this regard for the area of distribution, refrigeration equipment and packaging.</p>
      <p>SCC also stressed that in the last five years, the investment in modernisation and growth projects in Vialonga, Água de Luso and in Novadis distribution has already exceeded €140 million.</p>
