      <h1>Tottenham fans react as Serge Aurier scores in Ivory Coast defeat to Ethiopia</h1>
      <h2>The Spurs defender opened the scoring before his nation were pegged back.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T18:15:09+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 18:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/sam-preston/" target="_blank">Sam Preston</a></address>
      <p>Serge Aurier has had a tricky season with Tottenham but set about improving his form on international duty with the Ivory Coast today.</p>
      <p>The £23 million (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41081740">BBC</a>) man opened the scoring within just four minutes of his side’s trip to Ethiopia as they searched for a second win of their Africa Cup of Nations qualification group so far.</p>
      <p>But the lead was overturned within 26 minutes as Aurier’s men slipped to a shock defeat thanks to goals from Surafel Dagnachew and Shimeles Bekele Godo.</p>
      <p>And Tottenham fans on Twitter could hardly believe that the defender had scored, but were not shocked that he was part of a defence which let a lead slip and came up short against a supposedly weaker opponent.</p>

      <p>It is an indication of the strength of feeling towards the defender that he couldn’t get credit from his club’s fans for a goal on international duty.</p>
      <p>Although perhaps they were right to be concerned about his defensive performances, which have been his issue throughout his Tottenham career – and the fact he will come back to Spurs on the back of a defeat.</p>
