      <h1>Former Chelsea star backs the Blues to beat Manchester City</h1>

        <b>Eden Hazard feels that Chelsea can win their match against Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium this weekend.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Blues are currently third in the Premier League, one point above Pep Guardiola’s side. Last season, Chelsea were thrashed 6-0 the last time they took on Manchester City in the latter’s backyard. Hazard, who played in that game, feels that this weekend’s match will be a tough one but the Blues can win.</p>

      <p>As quoted by <a href="https://www.football.london/chelsea-fc/news/eden-hazard-chelsea-man-city-17279148">football.london</a>, the Belgian international told Sky Sports: “Of course they can beat Man City. It’s not going to be easy, it’s hard to play there and last time we played there we lost 6-0. So it’s bad memories for me and for Chelsea as well but I think this season they are really good. They are really young but really good, so why not go there and win the game?”</p>
      <p>Chelsea have done pretty well this season under Frank Lampard so far, having amassed 6 points from twelve matches so far. They’ve won their last six Premier League fixtures and have a squad capable of putting up a fight against Manchester City. However, Guardiola’s side will be eager to bounce back after losing 3-1 to Liverpool.</p>
      <p>If Chelsea win this weekend, they can move up to second in the Premier League table provided they are unable to beat Brighton and Hove Albion.</p>
