      <p>The government and the Travancore Devaswom Board (TDB) have failed in providing basic pilgrims facilities at Nilackal and Pampa for pilgrims coming from different parts of the country to the Sabarimala Ayyappa temple, according to Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan, MLA.</p>
      <p>Mr. Radhakrishnan, who was leading a team of United Democratic Front (UDF) leaders to Pampa and Nilackal, was talking to reporters at Pampa on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The UDF team said the government was sitting idle for the past nine months without taking any effective steps to ensure basic pilgrim facility even at Nilackal and at the flood-ravaged Pampa.</p>
      <p>V.S. Sivakumar, former Devaswom Minister; P.J. Joseph, former Public Works Minister, Mons Joseph, Parackal Abdulla, and N. Jayaraj, all MLAs, and Babu George, District Congress Committee president, were in the UDF team.</p>
      <h3>Nadappanthal leaking</h3>
      <p>Mr. Sivakumar said the temporary Nadappanthal erected at the last minute was leaking and the toilet blocks at Pampa were unhygienic and waterlogged.</p>
      <p>The temporary pilgrim shelter constructed at Pampa Manalpuram as an alternative to the huge Ramamurthy Mandapam that was washed away in the deluge of August last did not have any basic pilgrim facilities, Mr. Sivakumar alleged.</p>
      <p>Mr. Radhakrishnan said that the drinking water supply at Nilackal and Pampa was inadequate to meet the pilgrims’ need. The work on the vehicle parking lots at Nilackal had not yet been completed, he alleged.</p>
      <h3>Inadequate staff</h3>
      <p>The KSRTC staff on duty at Pampa and Nilackal too were inadequate, he alleged.</p>
      <p>Mr. Radhakrishnan said the UDF would take up the issue with the Chief Minister and the Devaswom Minister.</p>
