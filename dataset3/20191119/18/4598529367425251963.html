      <p>President Donald Trump refrained from levying his usual attacks on Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and other witnesses in the House impeachment investigation on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Trump, who has baselessly accused Vindman of being a “Never Trumper,” had a more muted response to the lieutenant colonel’s public testimony that was underway.</p>
      <p>“I watched him for a little while this morning and I think he…I’m going to let people make their own determination,” Trump told reporters during a Cabinet meeting. “But I don’t know Vindman. I never heard of him.”</p>
      <p>The comment strikes a noticeably softer chord from Trump, considering that he previously <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/trump-threat-expose-information-vindman-government-shutdown">threatened</a> to release information on Vindman “real soon” that supposedly proves the witness is biased against him.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, the President also toned down his fury toward diplomats Bill Taylor and George Kent, two other major witnesses in the investigation into Trump’s Ukraine scheme.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know who Kent is. I don’t know who Taylor is,” said Trump. “All these people are talking about…they heard a conversation of a conversation of another conversation that was had by the President.”</p>
      <p>As with Vindman, Trump had claimed without evidence that Taylor and Kent were “Never Trumpers.”</p>
      <p>The President frequently attacks impeachment witnesses, going as far as bashing former Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/trump-reaction-yovanovitch-public-testimony">in the middle of her testimony</a> last week on Twitter.</p>
      <p>The infamous tweet, which even Trump’s own advisers reportedly <a href="https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/trump-advisers-reaction-yovanovitch-attacks">saw as damaging</a>, handed Democrats another potential impeachment charge: witness intimidation.</p>
