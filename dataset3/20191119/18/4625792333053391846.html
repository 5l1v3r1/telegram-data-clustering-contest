      <h1>'Marginalized me as a military officer': Vindman complains about being attacked in the press and on Twitter</h1>

      <p>Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman bemoaned attacks against him from the press and on social media when asked about his military attire and an instance <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/read-opening-statements-from-alexander-vindman-and-jennifer-williams">during the testimony</a> where he corrected Rep. Devin Nunes.</p>
      <p>“I see you’re wearing your dress uniform. Knowing that’s not the uniform of the day, and that you normally wear a suit to the White House, I think it’s a great reminder of your military service,” said Rep. Chris Stewart.</p>
      <p>The Utah Republican went on to ask about the moment during Vindman’s testimony, where he <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/vindman-chides-nunes-its-lieutenant-colonel-vindman-please">chided Nunes for not referring him by his rank</a>.</p>
      <p>“Very quickly, I’m curious when ranking member Nunes referred to you as ‘Mr. Vindman’ you quickly corrected him and wanted to be called ‘Lieutenant Colonel Vindman,’ do you always insist on civilians calling you by your rank?” Stewart wondered.</p>
      <p>“I am in uniform wearing my military rank. I just thought it was appropriate to stick with that,” Vindman replied.</p>
      <p>Vindman, 44, said that he believed that the California Republican meant no disrespect by not referring to him without using his rank.</p>
      <p>“But the attacks that I’ve had in the press, in Twitter, have kind of eliminated the fact that [or] either marginalized me as a military officer,” Vindman began to explain before being cut off by Stewart, who reiterated that Nunes meant no disrespect to him.</p>
      <p>Earlier in the testimony, Vindman <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/alexander-vindman-explains-why-he-was-awarded-purple-heart">explained that he received the Purple Heart</a> he was wearing after being wounded by an IED during a combat operation in Iraq.</p>
      <p>Vindman’s <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/vindman-chose-to-wear-army-uniform-while-testifying-he-pulled-the-soldier-card-military-officer-says">choice to wear his military uniform</a> during Tuesday’s testimony also raised speculation as to what someone in Vindman’s position should wear before Congress.</p>
