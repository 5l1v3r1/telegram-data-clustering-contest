      <p>VENICE, LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- A family is searching for answers after a man was hit by a vehicle on his way to work at a Whole Foods in Venice and later died.<br/><br/>Timoteo Martinez Ildefonso, 43, died Friday after being hit by a pickup truck that was making a left-hand turn near the intersection of Lincoln Boulevard and Rose Avenue around 9:30 p.m., according to Los Angeles police.<br/><br/>Ildefonso was struck as he was crossing Lincoln Boulevard on his way back to work at Whole Foods.<br/><br/>"I just keep wondering if somebody called an ambulance right away, would he have been able to pull through," Martha Eve Jimenez, Ildefonso's wife, said.<br/><br/>Investigators say that according to witnesses, the driver stopped and tried to talk to Ildefonso as he returned to work.<br/><br/>"His head was bloody, and a coworker told me he brought him ice and a supervisor said, 'Well, OK, drive him home,'" Jimenez said.<br/><br/>Ildefonso was apparently unaware he had been gravely injured. His spleen was ruptured by the impact.<br/><br/>Jimenez says she can't understand why the driver, coworkers or her husband didn't call an ambulance or police after the accident.<br/><br/>"I think he was maybe in shock, I mean, he had hit his head really hard, so I don't know what his thinking was like at that point," Jimenez said.<br/><br/>The LAPD says the case isn't a hit-and-run since the driver of the red truck did stop, but authorities are trying to track him down to find out exactly what happened.<br/><br/><i>A <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-mom-kids-who-lost-their-dad-in-hit-and-run">GoFundMe page</a> has been established to help Ildefonso's family with funeral and living expenses.</i></p>
