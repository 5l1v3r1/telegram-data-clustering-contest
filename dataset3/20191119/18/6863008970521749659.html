      <p>President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky announced the restart of relations and the resumption of political dialogue at the highest intergovernmental level between Ukraine and the Czech Republic.</p>
      <p>The statement came at a joint press conference in Kyiv with Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, Andrej Babіs, according to a UNIAN correspondent.  </p>
      <p>Zelensky noted that for the first time in 10 years, the head of the Czech government arrived in Ukraine on an official visit.</p>
      <p>"Today, our countries are resuming political dialogue at the highest intergovernmental level," he said.</p>
      <p>The head of the Ukrainian state called negotiations with the head of the Czech government objective and intense.</p>
      <p>"When we talk about a restart, this is about a desire to meet and a desire to negotiate. This visit and our meeting testify to us entering a new level of relations between our countries," said the president. "The position of Mr. Prime Minister is that Crimea and Donbas are parts of Ukraine, so we can put an end to [speculations]. This is the position of the Czech Republic toward the citizens of Ukraine and to our sovereignty."</p>
      <p>"As for the prospects of our relations… Firstly, today there is a Ukrainian-Czech forum. It seems to me that the main thing in any relationship is that they should be economically beneficial for both countries. Today in Ukraine there are about 200 representatives of Czech businesses. We devoted a significant part of our conversation to what the Ukrainian side should do in order to increase the launch of Czech enterprises in Ukraine and increase Czech capital investments in Ukraine. This is investment protection and respect in business relations," he added.</p>
      <p>At a joint press conference with the President Zelensky, Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis announced a reset of relations with Ukraine.</p>
