      <h3>Kylie Jenner Is ‘Feeling Naughty This Year’ In Skintight Red Dress</h3>

      <p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/kylie-jenner/">Kylie Jenner</a> is on the naughty list this Christmas — at least, according to her.</p>
      <p>The Kylie Cosmetics billionaire posed against a fiery red wall in one of her latest <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5Bs4ohHVz2/">Instagram</a> photos, showcasing her latest lip kit creation, just in time for the holidays: a stunningly festive crimson red, which comes in her newest collection. The holiday-inspired kit, which launches today, is appropriately titled “Naughty List.”</p>
      <p>In the photo, Jenner looked at the camera with a seductive gaze, resting one red-gloved arm on the wall. Her left hand was poised on her hip, which jutted out to the side. Jenner wore a cherry-red, shiny dress that appeared to be made out of plastic, which showcased the sheen of the bright red gown. The skintight dress went down to her thighs, with a giant bow draped over the bottom of the frock, stopping just above her knees (the ribbon cascaded down further). The strapless dress had a sweetheart neckline and ruching that became more dramatic further down the dress to accentuate her hips.</p>
      <p>Jenner wore her hair in an old Hollywood style, with a deep part and soft, glamorous waves that tumbled down her shoulder and ended at the bottom of her chest. Her locks appeared darker at the root and more of a cherry-chocolate hue as it moved down the shaft of her hair.</p>
      <p>Of course, the <i>Keeping Up With The Kardashians</i> star’s makeup was the main event. As previously stated, she wore a knockout ruby lip; she also made up her eyes with scarlet shadow, a shade that perfectly complimented both the lip color and the dress. Jenner also wore a large diamond stud in her ear.</p>
      <p>You can see every angle of Jenner (and her outfit) against the multiple walls.</p>

      <p>Unsurprisingly, the image racked up more than 2 million likes and counting from her 151 million followers.</p>
      <p>Jenner also posted a series of images from the shoot, each picture more sultry than the last. The first one was a close-up of her face, with her red-gloved thumb slightly touching her ruby-red pout. In this image, the red in her hair stood out, as did her lips and eyes. In fact, because this portrait is entirely a close-up shot of Jenner’s face, you can really see the detailing of her makeup, particularly the red shadow she used on her eyelids and under her eyes as eyeliner.</p>

      <p>The second image is more of the same, only this time with Jenner gently tossing her hair behind her shoulder and giving a smoldering glare to the camera in all of her made-up glory.</p>
      <p>The third picture is the most sensual. In that photo, Jenner slightly moved her head back, eyes closed to flaunt the shadow, and placed her gloved hands on her neck.</p>
      <p>As the <i>Inquisitr</i> shared, Kylie recently promoted her Naughty List lip kit in another Instagram photo, this time rocking a <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5747853/kylie-jenner-naughty-list/">plunging black satin dress</a> and a darker red lip.</p>
