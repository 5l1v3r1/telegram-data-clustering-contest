      <p>Singer Alicia Keys and her husband Swizz Beatz dropped in on students at Harvard Business School as special guest speakers.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News) </b>Married stars Alicia Keys and Swizz Beatz headed back to Harvard Business School on Friday to stage a presentation all about the success of their personal and professional partnership.</p>
      <p>Hip-hop superproducer Swizz graduated from the prestigious Massachusetts institution's Owner/President Management Program in 2017, but he returned to the school last week - this time as a special guest speaker alongside his wife, Alicia.</p>
      <p>The "Girl On Fire" hitmaker shared the news on social media on Monday, when she uploaded photos of the pair in class, as well as images of course case studies, in which they were hailed as "a power couple."</p>
      <p>"Friday was a powerful day," she wrote alongside the Instagram images. "My baby @therealswizzz and I presented our case study on our lives and business at @HarvardHBS.⁣</p>
      <p>⁣ "Professor Boris Groysberg created three case studies: one of me, one of Swizz and one of us together.⁣ That's actually never been done before! It broke down business, leadership and how to have a successful business/life balance. ⁣</p>
      <p>⁣ "It was fascinating seeing our lives on a chalk board. At Harvard. Being used as a case study for success. It was sooo (sic) deep, seriously, it even uncovered things for me while I was sitting there."</p>
      <p>Alicia Keys went on to thank Professor Groysberg for granting them the "powerful moment" and expressed her delight at getting the opportunity to address students at the elite school.</p>
      <p>⁣ She added, "As a kid, I would've never imagined this!!⁣ Everything is possible!! ⁣If we can do it, you can do it better⁣. ⁣Love, gratitude and blessings."</p>
      <p>The musicians have been married since 2010 and share sons Egypt, nine, and Genesis, four.</p>
