      <h1>U.N. report author clarifies data behind migrant child detentions in U.S.</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T18:18:24+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 18:18</time> by <a rel="author">Sommer Brokaw</a></address>
      <p>Nov. 19 (UPI) -- The author of a United Nations human rights report maintained that the United States has the world's highest rate of child detention, but he has clarified a number he cited to back up that assertion.</p>
      <p>Attorney <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Manfred_Nowak/?tps=1">Manfred Nowak</a> authored the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights' "<a href="https://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/CRC/StudyChildrenDeprivedLiberty/Pages/Index.aspx">Global Study on Children Deprived of Liberty</a>" and voiced sharp criticism of U.S. policy to separate migrant children from parents, calling it "inhuman" and "absolutely prohibited" by the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p>
      <p>During a news conference Monday, he said more than 100,000 children remain in migration-related detention. At the time, he wasn't aware that the number from the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees reflected the total number of children detained throughout 2015, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/20/781279252/u-n-expert-clarifies-statistic-on-u-s-detention-of-migrant-children">he told NPR</a>.</p>
      <p>He said the figure, which doesn't appear in his report, was "quick info" provided by an assistant to answer a question at the news conference and that the report is "definitely accurate."</p>
      <p>According to the report, the annual number of apprehensions of unaccompanied children varied between about 39,000 and 69,000 between 2013 and 2018.</p>
      <p>About 69,550 children have been referred to the Unaccompanied Alien Children program during fiscal year 2019, according to Department of Health and Human Services statistics.</p>
      <p>"So perhaps it's really down now to 69,000. That's fine - but again, it's much higher than other states that detain children in migration-related detention," Nowak told NPR. "So it's still the highest number. So I think the main message remains the same."</p>
      <p>That message during the news conference included that separating migrant children from parents "is something that definitely should not happen again."</p>
      <p>During the news conference, Nowak added that the criminal incarceration rate of children in the United States is also very high.</p>
      <p>"It's about 60 [children] out of 100,000," he said. "That is the highest that we could find, followed by others like Bolivia, or Bostwana or Sri Lanka."</p>
      <p>The U.N. report <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/18/780539163/u-n-expert-faults-u-s-for-inhuman-treatment-and-high-incarceration-of-children">coincides with</a> the 30th anniversary of the adoption of the U.N. Convention on the Rights of Child -- which says child detentions should generally be avoided, used only as a last resort and then only if absolutely necessary "for the shortest possible period of time."</p>
