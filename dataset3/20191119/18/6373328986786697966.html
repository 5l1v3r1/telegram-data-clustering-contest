        <b><i>Friends</i> brought us endless cups of coffee and various romantic entanglements, with the action more or less bound up in a few instantly recognisable apartments and a bustling coffee house.</b>
      </p>
      <p>During that period we came to love various items, homely yet often unusual objects we came to recognise as keenly as our own potted plants or sofa cushions.</p>
      <p>Most obviously, there was the foosball table and the endlessly reservable Central Perk couch. But we also had Phoebe’s creepy ‘Gladys’ paintings. Ross’ numerous fossils. The Magna Doodle.</p>

      <p>Such items hold a fond place in the hearts of all true <i><a href="https://www.unilad.co.uk/film-and-tv/jennifer-aniston-confirms-friends-movie-will-never-happen/">Friends</a></i> fans, helping to set the scene and give each character a sense of heightened individuality and depth.</p>
      <p>It made perfect sense Joey would splash $200 on a large dog statue, just as it made sense Monica would absolutely hang a vintage Aux Buttes Chaumont – Jouets poster above her telly.</p>
      <p>The sight of such things help settle us in for a well-deserved <i>Friends</i> marathon, easing us out of the wintery weather and into a bubble of sitcom cosiness.</p>
      <p>With the cameras having long stopped rolling, there really can be no better way to celebrate the inspired props of <i>Friends</i> than having them auctioned off for a worthy cause. And this is exactly what is happening.</p>
