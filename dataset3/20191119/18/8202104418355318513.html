      <h3>The provincial government paid $72,500 to the estate of a 21-year-old woman who died while on remand four years ago as part of an out-of-court settlement of a lawsuit filed by her family.</h3>
      <p>Breanna Kannick’s family and the Ministry of Corrections and Policing <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/saskatchewan/kannicks-family-reaches-settlement-with-province">reached the settlement late last year.</a> The details are protected by a confidentiality agreement that prevents both sides from discussing them.</p>
      <p>However, the single lump sum payment to her estate through the law firm retained by her family, Yorkton, Sask.-based Rusnak Balacko Kachur Rusnak (RBKR), is captured in the 2018-19 public accounts, which list all government expenditures.</p>
      <p>Shane Wagner, the RBKR lawyer who represented Kannick’s mother, Sherri Chartrand, said in an email that he was not in a position to comment on any settlement. The government likewise declined to comment.</p>
      <p>Kannick died on Aug. 20, 2015 while on remand at the White Birch Remand Unit in Regina. <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/saskatchewan/kannick-inquest-jury-currently-deliberating-manner-of-death">A subsequent inquest into her death heard that she was suffering opioid withdrawal, and asked to see a doctor more than once</a>.</p>
      <p>In May, following 10 days of testimony and five and a half hours of deliberations, the inquest jury ruled Kannick’s death accidental and provided 10 recommendations aimed at preventing similar deaths in the future.</p>
      <p>A year earlier, her family sued the government, alleging the province and 11 people working at the facility “failed in their duties to take reasonable steps to ensure that Breanna was reasonably safe upon the premises.”</p>
      <p>The parties announced the settlement in November 2018, but did not disclose the amount.</p>
      <p>“We are pleased to see this process come to a close and sincerely hope the family and friends of Ms. Kannick are able to find some closure after this tragedy,” a spokesman for the ministry told the Regina Leader-Post at the time.</p>
