        <li>With the advent of <a href="http://insider.com/category/social-media">social media</a>, specifically <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/instagram">Instagram</a>, there are plenty of tourist attractions and destinations that have seen a serious spike in visits.</li>
        <li>While sometimes this new exposure can boost tourism – and give visitors a once-in-a-lifetime experience – other times it <a href="https://www.insider.com/worst-tourists-2017-2017-12">can be detrimental</a> to the environment or safety.</li>

      <p>“Tourism in Iceland grew rapidly, with an average year-on-year growth in tourist arrivals of over 25% since 2013, peaking in 2016 with 38% growth,” Inga Hlín Pálsdóttir, director at Visit Iceland, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/2019/04/13/iceland-tourist-destination-boom-decline/3379260002/">told USA TODAY</a>.</p>

      <p>Was “Sex and the City 2” <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sex_and_the_city_2">particularly well-liked</a>, or even necessary? Not exactly, but the movie <i>was </i>essentially a giant ad for Abu Dhabi tourism. The film made it seem like the most glamorous vacation spot in the world.</p>

      <p>The Marina Bay Sands, pictured in 2010, <a href="https://www.marinabaysands.com/content/dam/singapore/marinabaysands/master/main/home/company-information/media-centre/corporate-factsheets/history-and-milestones-of-marina-bay-sands-factsheet.pdf">opened its doors in April 2010</a> and immediately became Singapore’s largest and most popular hotel.

      <p>The Singapore Tourism Board credited the release of the 2018 romantic comedy “<a href="https://www.insider.com/category/crazy-rich-asians">Crazy Rich Asians</a>” for the spike in tourism. The Board said “organic search interest in Singapore rose by more than three times in the United States during the movie’s release,” and there was a 110% spike in searches on travel-planning site Orbitz.</p>

Celebrity visits, “The Bachelor,” and social media have all played a part in the surge of visitors to Pig Beach.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>But now, tourism is having a deadly impact on the pigs.</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>It was determined that pigs were dying from sand ingestion, which happened because tourists regularly throw food onto the beach, according to <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2017/03/swimming-pigs-bahamas-death/#close">National Geographic</a>.</p>
      <p>According to the US State Department, <a href="https://www.state.gov/u-s-relations-with-the-bahamas/">5.5 million people visit the Bahamas annually</a>.</p>

      <h3>Boracay, a small island in the Philippines, was named the 2012 Best Island in the World by Travel + Leisure because the beaches were so pristine.</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Boracay had only made its debut on the list in 2011, <a href="https://www.travelandleisure.com/slideshows/worlds-best-islands-2012">before topping the list in 2012</a>. At the time, Travel + Leisure wrote it had “still-under-the-radar status.”</p>
      <p>Not for long …</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>In 2018, Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte called the island a “cesspool” and shut it down for six months so the government could clean up.</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Boracay closed itself to visitors in April 2018, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/asia/philippines/articles/boracay-closure-when-will-island-reopen/">largely due to a viral video showing</a> “sewage flowing directly into Boracay’s blue waters.” The video is what led to Duterte calling the island a “cesspool.”</p>
      <p>In 1990, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/asia/philippines/articles/boracay-closure-when-will-island-reopen/">1 million people visited the Philippines</a>. Compare that to the 6.6 million who visited in 2017 – and more than 2 million of those visitors headed to the tiny island of Boracay.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/boracay-reopening-restrictions-intl/index.html">island reopened in October 2018,</a> but with significantly more infrastructure, and fewer tourists.</p>

      <h3>When “Game of Thrones” used the city as a stand-in for King’s Landing, tourism numbers rocketed. The city is in danger of losing its UNESCO World Heritage site status.</h3>

      <p>“Game of Thrones” premiered in 2011. By 2015, Dubrovnik was <a href="https://www.croatiaweek.com/the-most-visited-tourist-destination-in-croatia-in-2015-is/">regularly hitting its 3 million visitors target</a>. That year, it hit the milestone in October, 20 days earlier than 2014. And tourism has only increased since then.</p>
      <p>In 2017, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-croatia-dubrovnik/croatias-adriatic-gem-limits-number-of-tourists-to-fight-overcrowding-idUSKBN1KP0BF">UNESCO warned Croatia that the Old City of Dubrovnik</a> was in danger of losing its status as a World Heritage site due to the massive amount of tourists in relation to “the sustainable carrying capacity of the city.”</p>

Over the years, cafes have cropped up alongside the tracks, but before social media it was more of a hidden gem than a tourist destination.</p>
      <hr/>
      <h3>But the rise of Instagram made it impossible to keep the cafes open, and they were shut down in October 2019.</h3>
      <figure>

      <p>Hanoi’s government <a href="https://www.insider.com/hanoi-vietnam-shuts-down-instagram-famous-train-street-cafes-2019-10">ordered the cafes to close up shop by October 12</a>, citing safety concerns. The railroad is still active, and trains do travel it.</p>
      <p>The Guardian wrote that the area was considered a “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/10/vietnam-instagram-tourists-train-street-selfie-ban">rough part of town</a>” until selfie-hungry tourists started flooding the area trying to get a perfect post for Instagram.</p>
