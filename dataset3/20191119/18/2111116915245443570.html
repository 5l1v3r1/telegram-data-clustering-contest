      <p>When you're looking to get a PC that can handle the best PC games at a high resolution, you really have to prepare to swallow a huge price tag. However, Best Buy has an excellent gaming PC from Asus that you can save a substantial wad of cash on ahead of <a href="https://www.techradar.com/black-friday/black-friday-deals-2019">Black Friday</a>. </p>
      <p>The Asus ROG Strix GL12 is an absolute behemoth of a PC, packed with Intel 9th-generation processors and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/nvidia-turing">Nvidia Turing</a> graphics, all inside a PC case that's mall enough to fit in any gaming environment. The model Best Buy has for sale is specifically packed with an <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/intel-core-i7-9700k">Intel Core i7-9700K</a>, 16GB of RAM, an <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-rtx-2080">Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080</a> and a 512GB SSD. With a configuration like that, you should have no problem running every game at high frame rates. </p>
      <p>This configuration is available in this <a href="https://www.techradar.com/black-friday/best-buy-black-friday-deals-2018">Best Buy Black Friday deal</a> for $1,599, which is a whopping $700 cheaper than Asus' own store. Best Buy lists the regular price as $1,999, but the PC is actually a lot more expensive pretty much everywhere else. For instance, it's on 'sale' at Amazon for $2,895 for the same configuration. </p>
      <p>With this level of PC hardware, not to mention the included liquid cooling, we'd say this is a very tempting deal, especially if you want a stylish rig with minimal effort. </p>
