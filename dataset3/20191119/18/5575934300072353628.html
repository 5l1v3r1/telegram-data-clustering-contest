      <p>In late 2018, History reported that a recent survey of the region revealed over 60,000 previously unknown structures in the territory, which indicates that the Mayan civilisation was much larger than once believed. Before the discovery, it was said to have stretched from south Mexico to Guatemala and Belize.</p>
