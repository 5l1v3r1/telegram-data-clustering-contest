      <h1>NFL Insider Has Injury Update For Chiefs WR Tyreek Hill</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T18:57:49+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 18:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>Although the Kansas City Chiefs won last night against the Los Angeles Chargers, the offense lost All-Pro wideout Tyreek Hill to yet another injury. He left in the first half due to a hamstring issue.</p>
      <p>Hill already missed time this season because of a shoulder injury. There’s no question that he’s the second-most important piece on Kansas City’s offense – outside of Patrick Mahomes.</p>
      <p>Kansas City is currently on its bye week so it’ll have time to let Hill recover from his injury. But first, the Chiefs have to find out the severity of it.</p>
      <p>According to NFL Network insider Mike Garafolo, the Chiefs will have MRI results for Hill in the next day or so since the team came back late from Mexico City.</p>

      <p>The Chiefs desperately need Hill down the stretch as they try to lock up the AFC West.</p>
      <p>Next up on the schedule for Kansas City is a showdown against Oakland. That game could very well decide which team wins the division.</p>
      <p>In the event that Hill misses time yet again, the Chiefs will need Sammy Watkins and Mecole Hardman to step up. They both had strong starts to the season but have been quiet of late.</p>
      <p>We’ll know more about Hill’s status in the coming days.</p>
