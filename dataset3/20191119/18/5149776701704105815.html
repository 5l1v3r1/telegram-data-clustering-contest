      <p>Nottingham Forest fans are reacting to Joe Worrall's Reds team of the decade - and the players they might have included.</p>
      <p>Current <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Forest</a> centre-back <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/joe-worrall">Worrall</a> responded to our tweet asking supporters to name their fantasy City Ground XIs from the past 10 years.</p>
      <p>His <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-team-of-decade-3554953">team was made up of:</a> Brice Samba, Eric Lichaj, Jack Hobbs, Michael Dawson, Chris Cohen, David Vaughan, Ben Osborn, Henri Lansbury, Michail Antonio, Andy Reid and Britt Assombalonga.</p>
      <p>Wes Morgan, Radoslaw Majewski and Lewis McGugan were players who just missed out, according to Worrall's tweet.</p>

      <p><b>Owen Summers:</b> Who’d be manager, Joe?</p>
      <p><b>Lee Clarke:</b> Gunter over Lichaj and McKenna over Vaughan for me but other than that pretty steady</p>
      <p><b>@ITwobob:</b> So only 2 from current team</p>
      <p><b>Jordan Harland:</b> No cash [shocked face emojis]</p>
      <p><b>@LilMissRedDog:</b> McGugan never showed his full potential which is a massive shame. I’d have personally opted for Raddy but this isn’t a bad team tbh.</p>
      <p><b>Adam Webster:</b> Who we having as the Manager?</p>
