      <h2>Congress now investigating why ABC killed story about Epstein</h2>

        <b>Senator Mike Lee (R-Utah) brought up the viral “Epstein Didn’t Kill Himself” meme during a congressional hearing to point out the public’s concern surrounding the suspicious circumstances of billionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein’s death in prison.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Bureau of Prisons’ director Kathleen Hawk Sawyer testified on Capitol Hill on Tuesday that the FBI was investigating Epstein’s “suicide” and if a “criminal enterprise” was involved in his death.</p>
      <p>“There are a lot of indications, there are a lot of people who have expressed concerns culminating in the phrase ‘<a href="https://www.infowars.com/top-epstein-didnt-kill-himself-memes/">Jeffrey Epstein didn’t kill himself</a>,'” Lee told Sawyer.</p>
      <p>Lee continued: “It was initially reported that he had died by suicide, but according to a whole lot of news reports, a private pathologist who took a look at the case said that Mr. Epstein had experienced a number of injuries that are, as he put it, ‘extremely unusual in suicidal hangings and could occur much more commonly in homicidal strangulation.'”</p>
      <p>Lee then noted that given the security cameras in Epstein’s prison malfunctioned the night he died, authorities can’t be certain that Epstein did in fact die by suicide.</p>
      <p>The hearing comes after Republican leadership sent a letter this week to ABC News <a href="https://www.infowars.com/us-congress-cracks-down-on-abc-news-for-epstein-coverup-demands-to-know-who-killed-the-story-and-why/">demanding answers as to why the network killed a bombshell story on Epstein</a> in 2016.</p>

        <i>ABC News anchor Amy Robach, who in a leaked recording revealed that the network sat on the Jeffrey Epstein scandal for 3 years, is <a href="https://banned.video/watch?id=5dc201c7a7d0a9001cb41521">a “hundred percent” certain that Epstein was murdered</a>.</i>
