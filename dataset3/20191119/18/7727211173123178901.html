      <h2>LFC Stories: Could Shaqiri be utilised in a different role now he's returning to full fitness?</h2>

      <p>When it comes to the left-back position, Jurgen Klopp isn’t afraid to get a little creative. Liverpool played through an entire season with James Milner as the starter there, and that campaign finished with the Reds claiming a top-four finish.</p>
      <p>Initially, it was a shock. Milner is Mr Versatile and he’s played numerous positions throughout the years, but having a (then) 30-year-old right-footer as the outlet on the left was a brave move on Klopp’s part. The former Manchester City man lacked the explosiveness of usual full-backs and his desire to cut back inside on his stronger foot meant he was, at times, a little predictable.</p>
      <p>But this decision was actually the first step in the evolution of how Liverpool played under the German tactician. Instead of using the full-backs as an out-ball, Klopp, in the long-term, envisaged these positions as creative hubs.</p>
      <p>Given the opposition are so often happy to allow full-backs plenty of possession, it made sense to arm these areas with players who could do the most damage when on the ball. Milner had the vision to spot passes and the ability to execute them. He wasn’t afraid to play football and he’d try risky passes into the feet of the Liverpool attackers.</p>
      <p>The Reds weren’t just a threat from central areas. The left side of the pitch was a source of creativity. Andy Robertson’s arrival was the next step in this transformation. He could do what Milner did in possession, but also had the ability to get on the outside of opponents, too. Trent Alexander-Arnold’s emergence at right-back added to their arsenal going forward, with Liverpool now posing that threat from both sides of the pitch.</p>
      <p>The hybrid role saw the two full-backs turn into creative wingers when in possession. Since then, teams haven’t quite figured out how to stop them.</p>
      <p>But in creating such a unique role, Klopp has actually created a problem for himself. When Robertson and Alexander-Arnold aren’t available, it isn’t quite the same for the Premier League leaders.</p>
      <p>Joe Gomez and Milner fill in admirably but both are a little more reserved, which by default blunts Liverpool somewhat. But the European champions do have a player within their ranks already who could potentially step-in for the Scotland captain from time to time.</p>
      <p>Xherdan Shaqiri.</p>
      <p>On paper, it sounds like an outrageous idea. Like many of the Liverpool players, Shaqiri has played a number of roles throughout his career, but never left-back. On top of that, Klopp didn’t trust him to play as part of his midfield three, either, with the general feeling being the Switzerland international wasn’t diligent enough defensively to occupy one of those roles. The 28-year-old does have a tendency to wander.</p>
      <p>However, in reality, it makes a lot more sense than it should. Like when Milner was deployed there, to get a real picture of why it might work, what is already known about the player must be forgotten; instead, their playing profile must be looked at.</p>
      <p>What makes Robertson so effective for Liverpool is the fact he’s so comfortable in possession, he’s averaging 70 passes per 90 this season, and his delivery from wide areas. So far this term, the No.26 has an expected assist average of 0.17 per 90. It’s also worth remembering that in most expected models, crosses aren’t given high values due to various factors. Simply put, in general, it’s usually more difficult to score headers and volleys.</p>

      <p>What Robertson seems to do so well, however, is to pass the ball into the box. Though still registered as a cross, these are much more refined and geared towards team-mates so the likelihood of scoring is higher than the expected models would suggest.</p>
      <p>To find full-backs as composed as this is rare but for a player like Shaqiri, it’s normal. Despite being fairly creative, he’s also fairly frugal in possession. Last season, the former FC Basel man completed 82% of his passes, just 2% shy of Robertson’s average this term. He also averaged close to 55 passes for the Reds in the Premier League while playing 1.77 key passes. His expected assist per 90 average was 0.18 for the campaign.</p>
      <p>When looking at it statistically, there’s not too much difference between what Shaqiri posted last season to what Robertson has posted during the current campaign.</p>

      <p>Tactically, it’s not that difficult to picture Shaqiri in the Robertson position. His heat map above, for example, shows the majority of his touches last season arrived in deeper positions; areas Alexander-Arnold would be expected to operate in.</p>
      <p>If that image was mirrored, it would be areas Liverpool fans would expect to see their flying Scotsman in. It highlights how, in this system, the full-backs for the Reds do actually play like midfielders. It wouldn’t be a drastic change to the way Shaqiri played and the positions he takes up.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, while the 28-year-old has spent the majority of his time in England on the right, he is no stranger to playing on the left side. It’s a role he first emerged in for Basel when he burst onto the scene and it’s one he occupied for Bayern Munich during his time in Bavaria.</p>
      <p>He may have only been on Merseyside for 18 months, but Shaqiri has plenty of memorable moments. The double he netted against Manchester United was perhaps the standout one, but the cross for Gini Wijnaldum’s second in the historic victory over Barcelona won’t be far behind.</p>
      <p>It arrived from the left side of the pitch, in a zone Robertson has caused havoc in the past.</p>

      <p>But, as previously mentioned, Shaqiri has played there before. He knows what sort of delivery is required from there. In the still above, taken from his time in the Bundesliga, the Swiss bulldozer manages to play the perfect pass a wide left position. He doesn’t just whip the ball in aimlessly. Instead, he angles it to the back post and the hosts are able to tap home from close range. It’s a goal Liverpool have scored countless times with Robertson playing the part of the provider and Mohamed Salah that of the goalscorer.</p>
      <p>There are plenty of examples of Shaqiri playing as a left winger for Bayern but in a way that Liverpool use their left-back. As long as there’s enough cover behind him, there’s no reason he couldn’t play as a marauding full-back on Merseyside in a few matches. He has the skillset, both statistically and tactically, and the ability to be quite the revelation for the Reds in that position.</p>
