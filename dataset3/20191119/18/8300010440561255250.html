      <p>Alan R. Tripp, a 102-year-old man with a dream, is writing the musical script for the next decade. <br/><b>   •  <a href="https://6abc.com/localish/this-artists-custom-cleats-gives-the-eagles-some-extra-swagger-on-game-day/5698662/">Meet the man behind Eagles stars' custom cleats<br/></a></b>He and his musical partner, Marvin Weisbord, are tapping into an underserved market: songs for seniors. With over a century's worth of experience, they are combining the sounds of the 1940s with lyrics for the 2020s. <br/><br/><b>   •  <a href="https://6abc.com/localish/world-famous-chefs-serve-you-at-this-foodie-festival/5699088/">World-famous chefs serve YOU at this foodie festival<br/></a></b>Having survived many eras of musical evolution, Tripp studied how music moves people for his latest project. He defines the zeitgeist as having a human element, using his lyrics to relate to the life experiences of senior citizens. Between the unabashedly honest " I Just Can't Remember Your Name" and the nostalgic "Best Old Friends," these tracks will speak to many generations of people across the country. <br/><br/>You can hear the music for yourself at <a href="https://seniorsongbook.com/">SeniorSongBook.com</a>!</p>
