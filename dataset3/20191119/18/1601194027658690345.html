      <p>Last week, WWE Backstage had a huge on-air moment when <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/cm-punk">CM Punk</a> returned to the <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe">WWE</a> fold with an appearance in the last seconds of the show. While Renee Young was the only on-air talent aware of the move, this is something that’s been in slow preparation for a number of months now.</p>
      <p>While CM Punk has not signed a contract with the WWE that will see him return to the ring - at current his working contract is only with Fox - the WWE are reported to be working a tactical angle.</p>
      <p>A number of members of the current locker room, as well as some notable wrestling legends, have been encouraged by management or production staff to reach out and connect with CM Punk with a view to convincing Punk to approach WWE management about an in-ring return. This has already started with names such as <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/seth-rollins">Seth Rollins</a> and Booker T connecting with or speaking highly of CM Punk in public. There is apparently many more connections being made in private.</p>
      <blockquote>“I’ve never worked with him (Punk) but I want to. This is the closest I’ve ever been and I’d love for it to happen. The producers are excited as well. They want to see the match. They want it to happen.”</blockquote>
      <p>Sources have indicated that WWE firmly believe that CM Punk will be back in a wrestling ring and have every intention of ensuring that it is for them rather than a competitor. That said, Punk is known to be averse to the idea at current.</p>
      <p>I would be lying if I said that CM Punk would definitely wrestle again. However, I would also be lying if I said it definitely wasn’t going to happen.</p>
