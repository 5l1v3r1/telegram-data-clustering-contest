      <p>John Ameh, Abuja</p>
      <p>President Muhammadu Buhari on Tuesday condoled with former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar, over the death of his close aide, Umar Pariya.</p>
      <p>The President said he was touched by the loss, praying God to give Abubakar strength to bear it.</p>
      <p>“I received the news of the death of your close aide, Alhaji Pariya, with a heavy heart.</p>
      <p>“It is very touching to lose such a personal aide of many years. May Allah grant you the strength to bear the irreparable loss.</p>
      <p>‘‘May Allah grant his family the strength to absorb the impact of this death forgive his shortcomings and reward his good deeds in the hereafter”, Buhari said in a statement by his media aide, Mr Femi Adesina, in Abuja.</p>
      <p>Abubakar had contested the February 23 presidential poll against Buhari and lost in the results declared by the Independent National Electoral Commission.</p>
      <p>Not satisfied with the outcome, the former VP and candidate of the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party, approached the courts to challenge the victory of Buhari.</p>
      <p>However, Abubakar lost the case at both the tribunal and the Supreme Court.</p>
