      <h2>A couple were shocked to discover stickers from German value brand Aldi lurking underneath the Waitrose ones on a packet of roast vegetables from the upmarket supermarket</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T18:11:03+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 18:11</time> by <a rel="author">James Andrews, http://www.facebook.com/jameswritesmoney/</a></address>
      <p>A couple expressed their outrage after discovering stickers from German discount brand Aldi on a packet of Mediterranean vegetables from Waitrose.</p>
      <p>The pair, who asked to remain anonymous, discovered the Aldi sticker on food that arrived from Waitrose as part of an Ocado order last Sunday.</p>
      <p>"I was really disappointed. I use Waitrose and Ocado for good reasons - reputation and home delivery, and I pay for the privilege," one of the couple <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7694571/Outraged-couple-Aldi-stickers-covering-Waitrose-Mediterranean-roast-vegetables.html">told the Mail</a> .</p>
      <p>"No disrespect to Aldi or their customers but if I wanted their products I'd go to one of their stores."</p>
      <p>Aldi's sells Ready to Roast Winter Roast/Mediterranean Roast vegatables for £1.29, and it's version is the same weight as the £2 "Vibrant and Colourful" Waitrose product.</p>

      <p>When the couple complained to Ocado they were told: "I am sorry to hear that the Waitrose Mediterranean Roast Vegetables received were packed for Aldi.</p>
      <p>"I have now reported this to the relevant team in order to investigate things further with our supplier. I do apologise for the inconvenience caused and once we have an update we will get back in touch."</p>
      <p>The practice of sharing supplier between supermarket own brands is remarkably common in the industry - with one company frequently making products for several different brands.</p>
      <p>That doesn't mean the products are necessarily the same, though, with suppliers sometimes reserving better-quality produce for more expensive ranges, despite both sets being produced in the same factory.</p>

      <p>A Waitrose spokesman told the Mail: "We are sorry that there has been an error with the labelling at our suppliers and we are now looking into this. </p>
      <p>"As with all retailers, we will share suppliers for some of our products. </p>
      <p>"Any price variation will be reflected in the different specification of the product, such as ingredients used."</p>
