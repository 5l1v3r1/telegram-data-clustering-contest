      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/sheffield-shield">Sheffield United</a> midfielder John Lundstram believes that VAR time delay should be brought down to a single minute rather than checking it for a very long time.</p>
      <p>VAR was once again at the forefront of controversy after Sheffield United were denied an equalising goal after John Lundstram was found millimeters offside during the build-up to the goal.</p>

      <p>In one of the longest delays made by the VAR, John Lundstram was adjudged to have been offside after almost four minutes of delay in playing time. The Blades eventually found their equalising goal a couple of minutes later but VAR was once again the highlight of a match after everyone criticised the time delay the referees took to overturn the original decision.</p>
      <p>In an exclusive interview with the <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11683/11863421/john-lundstram-i-always-believed-i-would-get-to-the-premier-league">Sky Sports</a>, Lundstram said,</p>
      <blockquote>"That was annoying. I think they've got to bring that time down; if they cut it to, say, 60 seconds, it wouldn't be too bad but you're waiting for <i>so</i> longâ€¦ it killed the atmosphere; it killed the celebrations for the fans and the players."</blockquote>
      <p>John Lundstram has been one of the players of the season for the Blades. The midfielder made just ten appearances for Chris Wilder's side during the Championship-winning campaign but turned his fortunes around by reinventing himself as a box-to-box midfielder.</p>
