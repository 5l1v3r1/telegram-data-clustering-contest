      <p>A year after Alex Smith suffered a devastating leg injury, the quarterback’s wife, Elizabeth, is proud to see how far he has come.</p>
      <p>On Monday, Elizabeth shared an emotional video documenting Smith’s progress, in which he <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/06/21/redskins-alex-smith-learning-to-run-again-after-horrific-injury/">had to learn</a> how to reuse his leg.</p>
      <p>“November 18th… 1 Year and so much to be grateful for,” Elizabeth captioned the video.</p>
      <p>Last fall, Smith, 35, broke his right tibia and fibula <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/11/18/alex-smiths-ankle-dangles-wrong-way-in-stomach-turning-injury/">during a Week 11 game</a> against the Houston Texans and required immediate surgery. The injury and complications forced the veteran QB to have 17 surgeries. In July, Elizabeth shared that the quarterback no longer needed to wear a leg brace.</p>
      <p>“The last 8 months have been nothing short of crazy. Although it’s not over, today is a big milestone,” <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bz8eie8pKds/">Elizabeth posted</a> on social media at the time. “We are shedding the weight Alex has been carrying (literally and figuratively). It’s one step closer to the goal. The resilience, determination and mental fortitude of this man is unmatched.”</p>
      <p>Smith signed a four-year, $94 million contract with the Redskins in March 2018. He previously played for the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers.</p>
