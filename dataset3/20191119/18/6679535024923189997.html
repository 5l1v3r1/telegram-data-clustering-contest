      <p>A 20-year-old PU student was assaulted, stripped and robbed by two men while she was alone at her home in Peenya on Monday morning. The victim’s mother and brother, who live with her in a rented house, were away at the time.</p>
      <p>According to the police, the victim’s mother, a tailor, had gone to her son’s school to complain against two classmates who had taken money from her son.</p>
      <p>At around 12.30 p.m., when the victim was alone, two men identified as Arun and Nusrath, barged into the house, and overpowered and gagged her. They dragged her into a room, assaulted her and robbed a gold chain and pair of silver anklets that she had on her. “They ransacked the house and before leaving threatened to kill her if she told anyone about the attack,” said a police officer. The police have taken up a case against the duo and efforts are on to track them down.</p>
