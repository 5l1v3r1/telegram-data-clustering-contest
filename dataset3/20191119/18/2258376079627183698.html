      <p>SASKATOON -- A shopper was surprised after finding a dead scorpion hidden in a package of blackberries sold at a Saskatoon Sobeys.</p>
      <p>Jaelyn Ford and her roommate noticed the insect tail poking out of the fruit package at Sobeys on 8th Street East on Monday morning.</p>
      <p>"At first, my roommate thought it was a leaf. But then I picked it up, and noticed it was a scorpion,” Ford said.</p>
      <p>Ford, who grew up on a family farm, wasn’t too bothered by the situation.</p>
      <p>"It was surprising, but it’s not a big deal. These kinds of things happen,” Ford said, laughing.</p>
      <p>In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for Sobeys confirmed the scorpion was found and at the location.</p>
      <p>"This is not consistent with the experience we strive to provide our customers in-store," Jacquelin Weatherbee, Sobeys’ director of communications said.</p>
      <p>“In addition to removing the berries, we also inspected all of the fresh produce to ensure there were no other ‘unexpected visitors’ in the packaging.”</p>
      <p>Sobeys said it conducts visual inspections in the field, inside warehouses where produce is stored and at the store.</p>

        <b>Toxicity varies</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), while it's uncommon, scorpions have been known to hide in bunches of bananas or imported berries.</p>
      <p>All known species of the insect are venomous, but the toxicity of the venom varies by species, the CFIA says on its <a href="https://www.inspection.gc.ca/food/information-for-consumers/fact-sheets-and-infographics/products-and-risks/fruits-and-vegetables/safety-measures/eng/1332275927192/1332275998287">website</a>.</p>
      <p>In the event of a scorpion sting, the government agency recommends washing the affected area with soap before applying a cold compress.</p>
      <p>The CFIA compares the typical symptoms of a scorpion sting to those of a bee sting. However, if more serious symptoms arise such as dizziness, blurred vision and difficulty swallowing, the CFIA recommends seeking immediate medical attention.</p>
