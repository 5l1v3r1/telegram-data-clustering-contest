      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/marcus-rashford">Marcus Rashford</a>, <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/harry-kane">Harry Kane</a> and <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/raheem-sterling">Raheem Sterling</a> are in the form of their lives for England at the moment, and the Manchester United star is excited by the partnership they have struck up.</p>
      <p>Rashford was talking to <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/11864500/marcus-rashford-excited-by-englands-frightening-attack">Sky Sports</a> when he heaped praise on Kane, Sterling and himself, stating:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>"I think it is obviously a good combination but we have played games without that particular front three and it is frightening what we can do as a group of attackers.”</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Aside from Rashford, Kane and Sterling, the England squad has plenty of quality attackers, with the likes of Jadon Sancho, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Tammy Abraham ready to step in when required.</p>
      <p>Rashford went on to state that England will have to take advantage of the depth they have in the squad.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“You have to use it to your advantage and maybe it isn't working in one game for that three and someone has to come in and make the difference - we have to use that to our advantage, 100 per cent!”</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>England managed to score 37 goals in 8 EURO 2020 qualifying games while conceding just 3. They scored 7 against Montenegro last week at Wembley in what was the country's 1000th international game.</p>
      <p>In their last 3 matches, against Bulgaria, Montenegro and Kosovo, England scored 17 goals without reply.</p>
