      <h1>Page: Referee Dan Miragliotta apologized for ‘s—t’ show, Bellator beef now squashed</h1>

      <p>Bellator MMA welterweight wunderkind, Michael Page, has mended fences with longtime mixed martial arts (MMA) referee, Dan Miragliotta, following their profanity-laced kerfuffle last September in Dublin, Ireland.</p>
      <p>Page <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/9/28/20888471/video-michael-page-referee-dan-miragliotta-called-him-a-piece-of-sh-t-bellator-dublin-win-mma-ufc">blamed Miragliotta for calling him a “piece of shit”</a> for his post-fight celebration at Bellator 227, which ended by way of flying knee. “Venom” was accused of <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/10/1/20893278/pissed-dan-miragliotta-refuses-referee-future-michael-page-fights-bellator-dublin-mma">telling the veteran man in black to “fuck off,”</a> prompting the verbal retaliation.</p>
      <p>“He came up to me and he apologized for … just the whole thing,” Page told the <a href="https://apple.co/331HXOy">Eurobash podcast</a>. “We had a nice discussion so for me, that episode is now past; it’s old news now. That’s all I said I wanted, I wanted to have a face to face with him. All respect to him, he came up to me and we’ve squashed that. It’s just a thing of the past now.”</p>
      <p>Page (15-1) returns to the cage for Bellator “London” this weekend across the pond. That’s where “Venom” will throw hands opposite Giovanni Melillo in the five-round main event. The referee assignment for their headlining affair has yet to be revealed.</p>
