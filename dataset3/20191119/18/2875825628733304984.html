      <h1>Every Premier League club's average weekly player salary listed for 2019-20 campaign</h1>
      <h2>With record broadcast revenues and eye-watering kit deals, plus a string of other lucrative commercial deals, Premier League clubs are richer than ever before</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T18:32:53+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 18:32</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>The riches of the Premier League has persuaded the world's best players to ply their trade in England - and new figures have revealed just how much clubs pay their superstars on a weekly basis.</p>
      <p>With record broadcast revenues and eye-watering kit deals, plus a string of other lucrative commercial deals, top-flight clubs are richer than ever before.</p>
      <p>That financial muscle has ultimately allowed them to spend big on wages and, as such, help them lure players to these shores ahead of their European rivals.</p>
      <p>Unsurprisingly, it is <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> - bankrolled by Sheik Mansour's Abu Dhabi United Group - who sit top of the list, which has been compiled by <a href="https://www.spotrac.com/">spotrac.com</a> .</p>

      <p>The reigning Premier League champions fork out around £115,000 per week on player salaries, with £350,000-a-week Kevin De Bruyne, £300,000-a-week Raheem Sterling and £230,000-a-week Sergio Aguero their top earners.</p>
      <p>Despite their whopping salaries, Pep Guardiola's title chasers have this week announced record revenues of £535million, which includes a profit of £10.1m.</p>
      <p>City are closely followed by league leaders <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> , whose weekly salary is estimated to cost them around £100,000.</p>
      <p>It's not a huge shock that key players Mohamed Salah, who earns £200,000 per week, and £180,000-a-week defender Virgil van Dijk are among their top three earners.</p>

      </figure>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> , armed with Roman Abramovich's billions, complete the top three as they pay on average £95,000 a week, which is £3,000 a week more than London rivals <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> .</p>
      <p>Perhaps one of the biggest surprises in the list is the position of <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> , who despite going on a £148m spending spree in the summer, are down in fifth when it comes to wages.</p>
      <p>Their average stands at a reported £90,000 per week, and the Red Devils will splash out over £141million on their senior squad during the course of the campaign - not including the likes of Alexis Sanchez and Chris Smalling, currently out on loan.</p>
      <p>David de Gea is United's highest earner, having signed a deal worth approximately £375,000-a-week, while Scott McTominay is the lowest earner, on a reported £10,000-a-week.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>As expected, the final member of the Premier League's Big Six, <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> , do indeed complete the top six in terms of salaries, too.</p>
      <p>The north Londoners, whose owner Daniel Levy is known to be a firm negotiator when it comes to a player's salary - whether it be a current star or a potential new signing - have a weekly wage bill of £72,500.</p>
      <p>A large portion of that will go to Harry Kane and Tanguy Ndombele, who are tied as the club's top earners on £200,000 a week, some way ahead of £140,000-a-week Son Heung-min, while Dele Alli, Hugo Lloris and Jan Vertonghen take home £100,000 a week.</p>

      <p>Elsewhere <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> , despite having a reputation for being big spenders, are 13th the list as they spend around £36,673 on wages - which includes Portugal's £100,000-a-week pair Joao Moutinho and Rui Patricio.</p>
      <p>Another shock is that fact that London pair <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> - who fork out £65,000 and £55,000 respectively - pay more than top-four contenders <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> , who seem to be getting bang for the buck by paying £50,000.</p>
      <p>At the bottom of the pile Sheffield United's players - such as captain John Egan, midfield star John Lundstram and boyhood fan striker Billy Sharp - take home just £9,000 per week on average.</p>
