      <h1>Geek Pick: Sennheiser’s GSP 370 Is an Exceptional Wireless Gaming Headset</h1>

      <p>I’ve reviewed many headsets in recent years but have never had the pleasure of reviewing one from Sennheiser. I recently received a review unit of the company’s latest peripheral: the GSP Wireless Gaming Headset. Not knowing what to expect from the device, I was blown away by just about everything it provides players. Though a bit pricey at <a href="https://en-us.sennheiser.com/gaming-headset-wireless-gsp-370">$199.95</a>, I can assure you it is worth every penny. This is the perfect headset for players looking to step up their gaming experience.</p>
      <p>As its name states, the GSP 370 is a wireless headset. It is compatible with PC, Mac, and PlayStation 4. Set up is easy. On PS4, all you need to do is insert the included USB dongle into the system, turn on the headset, and play. For PC, you’ll want to install the Sennheiser Gaming Suite program from the company’s website. This is an important step as it allows you to update the headset’s firmware. It’s also how you can tweak the device’s sound settings. Other than that, using the GSP 370 on your PC is a straightforward process.</p>

      <p>The headset is light but durable. Black plastic covers the headband, earcups, and microphone. You can slide the headset’s arms to adjust it to your head. Even if you have a big cranium, it’ll fit you comfortably. The split padding on the headband is also very comfortable. That, combined with the ability to adjust the length of the arms, means you can game on the GSP 370 for many many hours. You may even forget you have the device on your head.</p>
      <p>You can raise or lower the microphone attached to the left side of the headset. Lowering it enables you to speak while raising it mutes it. There is an audible click when you lower the mic, letting you know you’re good to talk. I’m a big fan of mics that mute in this fashion so I’m glad the GSP 370 has this feature.</p>
      <p>To test the microphone’s quality, I used it in a variety of ways. On PC, I fired up Audacity and recorded some small soundbites. While my voice quality was a tad on the thin side, I came through loud and clear. Doing a live stream also produced the same results. Friends who I talked to in a PS4 party chat found the quality of my voice excellent. Noise cancellation removes any and all background noise; which included a fan I had running during testing. There’s very little to complain about when it comes to the GSP 370’s mic quality.</p>

      <p>Sound quality is what makes or breaks a headset and the GSP 370 does not disappoint. For the purposes of testing, I played <a href="https://www.geek.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2-isnt-boring-1758468/"><i>Red Dead Redemption 2</i></a> on PC and <a href="https://www.geek.com/games/geek-pick-death-stranding-delivers-the-goods-1810836/"><i>Death Stranding</i></a> on PS4. Ambient noise from calm winds, rustling trees, running rivers, and light rainfall come through perfectly. The same is true for creaky wooden doors, heavy footsteps, or descending/ascending elevators. The headset also does an excellent job with big booming explosions and bombastic soundtracks. No matter how loud things get, sounds never become overwhelming; nor do they cause the audio to crack. Both bass and treble are nice and crisp. Overall, the GSP produces an amazing, balanced sound.</p>
      <p>The headset’s most touted feature is its battery life. Sennheiser says players can expect up to 100 hours. I’ve used the headset for well over 30 hours and the Gaming Suite program says I still have 70% battery life. I don’t have much else to say other than this is the longest-lasting headset I’ve tested.</p>

      <p>The Sennheiser GSP 370 is one of the best mid-level gaming headsets out there. It produces exceptional sounds that pull you into whatever game you’re playing. The microphone enables your voice to come through clearly, and its solid lightweight design makes it easy to use for long hours. If you’re in the market for a new gaming headset, the GSP 370 is exactly what you’re looking for.</p>
