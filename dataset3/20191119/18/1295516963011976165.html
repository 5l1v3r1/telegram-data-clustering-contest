      <h1>REPORT: Sonic Redesign Cost Significantly Less Than Initially Reported</h1>

      <p>When the first trailer for <i><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/sonic-the-hedgehog-movie/">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> </i>dropped in April, the internet had a field day with the uncanny valley design of the cobalt speedster. Their most recent trailer shows an improvement on the design, which falls more in line with the video game icon's recognizable design. But how much did those redesigns cost?</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.cbr.com/sonic-redesign-boosts-costly-yet-positive-reactions/">Earlier reports</a> estimated that the cost for redesigning Sonic for the whole film would be around $35 million. For the trailer alone, it was estimated that Paramount Pictures spent $2.15 million improving Sonic's design. <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2019/11/sonic-redesign-cost-paramount-five-million-1202190493/">According to <i>IndieWire</i>,</a> however, the character redesign only cost the studio around $5 million.</p>

      <p>Most of the VFX work wasn't complete when the first trailer dropped, saving the studio a lot of time and money when it came to fixing the design. "Most of the VFX were not finished," the unnamed source told <i>IndieWire</i>. "So redesigning Sonic proved not to be as outrageously expensive as it would have been had all the film's VFX been done," they added. <i>IndieWire</i> claims the source is someone who worked closely on the production of the movie.</p>
      <p>Opening Feb. 14, director Jeff Fowler's <i>Sonic the Hedgehog</i> stars Ben Schwartz as Sonic and Jim Carrey as Dr. Robotnik, with James Marsden, Neal McDonald, Tika Sumpter, Adam Pally and Natasha Rothwell.</p>
