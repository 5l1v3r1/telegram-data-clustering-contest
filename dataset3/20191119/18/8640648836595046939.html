      <p>A woman reported missing in Las Vegas on Sunday has been found dead, the Clark County coroner’s office said Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Jennifer Cleary, 48, was last seen around 10 a.m. Sunday near Rancho and Vegas drives. The coroner’s office confirmed Tuesday morning that Cleary had died but cause and manner of death were pending.</p>
      <p>Metropolitan police issued a statement Tuesday morning about Cleary that said “a deceased female was located in the 1100 block of Orange Circle (Monday) morning.”</p>
      <p>“This is an open case and detectives are waiting for the Clark County coroner’s office to determine cause and manner of death before proceeding,” police said. “There are no additional details to release at this time.”</p>
      <p>Police sought the public’s help in finding Cleary over the weekend, saying she was “suffering from extreme emotional distress and may be in need of medical attention.”</p>
