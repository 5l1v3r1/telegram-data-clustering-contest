      <p>A 19-year-old youth was stabbed to death by four accused, while his elder brother escaped with injuries, after a quarrel ensued between the group at a wedding in Ughat area of Rander in Surat, on late Monday night.</p>
      <p>The deceased Vijay Borkar, a resident of EWS quarters in Ughat, was at the wedding of his friend’s sister in the nearby slum area, when the incident took place. Vijay worked at a car repairing workshop in Palanpur Jakatnaka area of the city.</p>
      <p>Vijay and others were playing raas garba when he accidentally pushed a youth, Bhola Ganava who was accompanied by three others identified as Nilesh Nayka, Vishal Rathod and Lalu Bokha, all residents of the same area. Vijay and Bhola had a heated exchange, following which Vijay was stabbed by Vishal on his chin and chest. Vijay’s elder brother, Ravi (24) tried to intervene and he, too, was stabbed on his right leg by the accused.</p>
      <p>The duo was rushed to a nearby private hospital where Vijay succumbed to his injuries and Ravi is undergoing treatment. The latter lodged a complaint and Rander police has registered a case against the four accused under IPC sections 302 (Punishment for murder), 323 (Punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 324 (Voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means), 504 (Intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace) and 114 (Abettor present when offence is committed).</p>
      <p>Rander Police Inspector LP Bodana said, “The accused are also residents of the same slum where the incident took place. They have gone underground after the incident. Vijay had accidentally pushed one of the accused which resulted into a verbal quarrel and later turned violent. Ravi is now out of danger.”</p>
