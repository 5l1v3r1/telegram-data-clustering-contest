      <p>Nov. 19 (UPI) -- <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Kevin_Hart/?tps=1">Kevin Hart</a> will release a "real" and "raw" new Netflix docu-series in December.</p>
      <p>The 40-year-old actor and comedian said in an Instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5DMP1hF7tX/">video</a> Tuesday that his docu-series <i>Don't [Expletive] This Up</i> will premiere on the streaming service Dec. 27.</p>
      <p>The docu-series consists of six episodes and follows Hart in his day-to-day life. The show charts the ups and downs of Hart's recent personal and professional life, including his Oscars controversy.</p>
      <p>Hart <a href="https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2018/12/07/Kevin-Hart-withdraws-as-Oscars-host-after-anti-gay-comments-emerge/9361544160237/">stepped down as Oscars host</a> in December 2018 after his past homophobic tweets re-surfaced online. The posts, dating back to 2011, have since been deleted.</p>
      <p>"I'm releasing a documentary with Netflix," Hart says in the video. "It's a look into my life over the last year and a half. Which has been a hell of a roller coaster -- peaks, hills, valleys, ups, downs. It's as real, as raw, as transparent as you can be, and something I think people need to see."</p>
      <p>"Always looking for ways to improve and progress and this documentary was one of the ways I felt I could do that," he added.</p>
      <p>The docu-series also <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1094836/kevin-hart-s-new-netflix-series-will-tackle-oscars-controversy">features</a> interviews with Hart's friends and family, archival footage from his childhood and early days in stand-up comedy.</p>
      <p>Hart previously released a stand-up comedy special with Netflix, <i>Irresponsible</i>, in April.</p>
      <p>In addition to the docu-series, Hart will star in <i>Jumanji: The Next Level</i>, which opens in theaters Dec. 13. <a href="https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2019/11/14/The-Game-Awards-to-air-live-in-select-theaters/4541573755819/">The film will screen</a> in select theaters alongside The Game Awards on Dec. 12.</p>
      <p>Hart was injured in a car crash in September. Hart's friend, producer Jared Black, was driving the car with his fianc√©e, Rebecca Broxterman, and Hart as passengers. Authorities <a href="https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2019/10/11/Kevin-Hart-wasnt-wearing-seat-belt-in-crash-California-Highway-Patrol-says/6321570803462/">attributed the crash</a> to reckless driving in October.</p>
