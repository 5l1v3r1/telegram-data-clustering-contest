      <h1>Number of bars in State to be cut down by 40% from January</h1>
      <h2>Government plans to make brewing and sale of illicit liquor non-bailable offences</h2>

      <p>The State government proposes to amend the existing Acts with a stringent punishment for brewing and sale of illicit liquor, and adulteration. The government is contemplating treating such cases as non-bailable ones.</p>
      <p>Imprisonment of six months and imposing penalty amounting to five times the licence fee if bar owners violated the rules are some of the proposals that will be incorporated in Amendment Bill which will be introduced in the coming Assembly session.</p>
      <p>Also, the number of bars will be brought down by 40% instead of the earlier proposal to bring them down by 50% from January. These decisions were taken at a review meeting on bar policy chaired by Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy at his camp office on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The officials raised objections when Mr. Jagan suggested to cut down the number of bars by 50%. An extensive discussion ensued in this regard. The officials pointed out that the government closed down 20% liquor shops as part of its prohibition policy. The number of liquor shops was reduced to 3,500 from 4,380. Similarly, the number of bars could also be reduced in a phased manner, they felt.</p>
      <h3>‘Hike licence fee’</h3>
      <p>The meeting suggested stepping up vigil at the check-posts, and installing night vision CC cameras at all vital locations and all the liquor shops maintained by the government. “Increase the application and licence fee in such a manner the people will have a fear of price gouging. It was way to de-addict people,” Mr. Jagan said.</p>
      <p>The government, finally, decided to cut down the number of bars by 40%. At present, licences have been issued to 839 bars, including 38 ‘star hotels’ and 4 pubs. If the star hotels and pubs, which fall under the hospitality sector, were to be excluded, the effective total would be 797. The new licences for bars would be issued through the lottery system. Now bars would be open from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. and food would be allowed till 11 p.m. Bars in star hotels would be allowed to be open from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m.</p>
      <p>Excise Minister K. Narayana Swamy and others were present.</p>
