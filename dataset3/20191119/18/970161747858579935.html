      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/doctor-who/">Doctor Who</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/doctor-ingrid-oliver-dances-zygons-hilarious-throwback-clip-11163512/"> star Ingrid Oliver</a> has been cast for Terry Pratchett’s new BBC adaptation of The Watch.</p>
      <p>The Defending The Guilty actress will debut in the drama as Head Of The Assassin’s Guild, Doctor Cruces.</p>
      <p>Also set to join the cast of the BBC America series is Ruth Madeley, Hakeem Kae-Kazim and Bianca Simone Mannie.</p>
      <p>Set in a fictional city where crime has been legalised, The Watch is a genre-busting series that follows a group of misfit cops as they rise up from decades of helplessness to save their corrupt city from catastrophe.</p>
      <p>Uniquely anarchic and thrillingly entertaining, the character-driven drama follows several of Sir Terry Pratchett’s best-loved creations on a riotous and emotional odyssey.</p>
      <p>Pennyworth’s Anna Chancellor is set to star as Lord Vetinari, The Patrician of Ankh-Morpork, and architect of the city’s normalised wrongness and ramshackle system of governance.</p>

      <p>While Ruth Madeley will star as the wiry Throat, the city’s best snitch, with a gang of freelance henchmen at her beck and call.</p>
      <p>Hakeem Kae-Kazim stars as Captain John Keel, former leader of The Watch and mentor to Sam Vimes, determined to save the corrupt and chaotic city.</p>
      <p>Bianca Simone Mannie (Homeland, Saints &amp; Strangers) stars as the cunning Wonse, a wizard hopeful in waiting that is frequently underestimated.</p>
      <p>‘It’s a joy to be part of The Watch and take on the role of Doctor Cruces. She’s such a fascinating character and pretty badass.’</p>
      <p>Anna commented: ‘It’s been so exciting to join such a wonderfully creative team – from writer Simon Allen to the stunning production design and a truly talented group of actors – to help realise Terry Pratchett’s brilliantly anarchic yet strangely real and moving world. With the combining characteristics of Dracula and Elvis – Lord Vetinari has sprung to life in the most alarmingly joyful way.’</p>

      <p>James Fleet added: ‘I’m delighted to be playing the Archchancellor. I think the writing and design catch the spirit of Terry Pratchett’s work and create a world of jeopardy and humour.</p>

      <p>Ruth Madeley continued: ‘I’m so excited to be part of a world that Sir Terry Pratchett created. The character of Throat was male in the original books so for the team to cast me was extra exciting. I’m really looking forward to seeing how Throat develops and what mischief she can bring.’</p>
