        <b>Four individuals wearing masks to conceal their identities stormed The Epoch Times’ Hong Kong printing press, threatened workers and set the facility on fire.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Armed with batons and dressed in all black, the men entered the building around 3:40 a.m. and told employees, “All of you don’t move!”</p>
      <p>One man is seen tossing a liquid near printing press equipment and stacks of newspapers before another man uses a lighter to ignite the substance.</p>
      <p>Surveillance footage shows the four men run off as soon as the flames erupt.</p>

      <p>In total, “two print machines, four rolls of printing papers, and several stacks of newspapers,” were damaged during the blaze, according to <a href="https://www.theepochtimes.com/masked-intruders-set-fire-to-hong-kong-epoch-times-printing-press_3150829.html">The Epoch Times.</a></p>
      <p>The attack is believed to be an attempt by the Communist Chinese Party (CCP) to silence the pro-Hong Kong freedom Epoch Times.</p>
      <p>The newspaper’s Hong Kong spokesperson Cheryl Ng said, “The fact that two of the thugs dressed in black outfits which looks like the protesters is also view[ed] by us as CCP tactics trying to use people against people.”</p>
      <p>This is the fourth attack on the location since its opening over a decade ago.</p>
      <p>The ongoing situation in Hong Kong continues to escalate with around <a href="https://www.infowars.com/hong-kong-university-standoff-one-hundred-students-still-trapped/">100 protesters currently trapped</a> inside the city’s Polytechnic University after a three-day siege by police.</p>
