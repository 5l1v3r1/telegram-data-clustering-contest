      <p>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) — New estimates show that more than half of the same-sex couples living together in U.S. households are married.</p>
      <p>New figures released Tuesday by the U.S. Census Bureau show that about 543,000 same-sex couples living together in households were married and 469,000 same-sex couples living together were unmarried.</p>
      <p>The estimates from the bureau’s 2019 Current Population Survey show 191,000 children living with same-sex parents.</p>
      <p>The estimates capture only same-sex couples living together and don’t reflect non-cohabitating same-sex couples nor single people.</p>
      <p>The Census Bureau says this is the first year in the survey that a same-sex option was included in the question about household relationships and that gender-neutral questions about parents were included.</p>
      <p>The bureau says the changes reflect the growing diversity of families in the U.S.</p>
