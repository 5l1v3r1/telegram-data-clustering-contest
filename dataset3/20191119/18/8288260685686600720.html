      <h2>Wolves latest | The video has been watched over 2.9 million times since it was uploaded on Monday night.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T18:59:11+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 18:59</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Leach, https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/authors/tom-leach/</a></address>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> target man Kevin Kyle has shared a warning to his twitter followers in the run up to Christmas after he 'almost killed' one his children in a swegway hoverboard crash.</p>
      <p>The video, which was been watched over 2.9 million times since it was uploaded on Monday night, shows 6ft4 Kyle riding around his kitchen on the swegway with one of his children before losing his balance.</p>
      <p>The popular children's toy then flips Kyle and his son into the air before they are both slammed down on the kitchen floor with Kyle's head narrowly missing the corner of the kitchen counter.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"Anyone thinking of getting a hoverboard for their kids Xmas think twice," Kyle tweeted alongside the video filmed last Chirstmas.</p>
      <p>"This is where I nearly killed my youngest and myself."</p>
      <p>But all was well in the Kyle household and the former Wolves striker later tweeted a video of his son back on the hoverboard with the caption: "[It's] safe to say the wee man got back on his feet like a real trooper and showed his Dad how to do it."</p>
      <p>Kyle made 274 league appearances for Sunderland, Coventry and Rangers, amongst others, during a 14-year long professional career.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He has been retired from the game since 2014, last turning out for Scottish non-league side Newton Stewart.</p>
