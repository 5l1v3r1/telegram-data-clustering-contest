      <h1>This Month's Ford Flex Discount Is Better Than Ever</h1>
      <h2>It even surpasses last month's generous offer.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T18:55:53+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 18:55</time> by <a rel="author">Jay Traugott</a></address>
      <p>Very soon it'll be time to say goodbye to the Ford Flex. Despite its breadbox-like exterior styling, the Flex was one of the first crossovers to market to offer three rows of seats for up to seven passengers when it hit the market in 2009. It has changed very little since then and enjoyed a decent decade-long run. That said, unsold examples are just sitting on Ford dealership lots, which is why the automaker is doing its utmost to shift them.</p>
      <p>Last month, Ford offered as much as <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/ford-desperately-wants-to-sell-leftover-flex-crossovers">$5,000 in savings</a> through a combination of customer cash and bonus cash. In September, the best discount was <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/fords-least-loved-crossover-gets-a-huge-discount">$4,500 off MSRP</a>. With each new month comes even better offers. November is no different. Depending on location, buyers can save up to $6,000 right now on a new <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/ford/flex">2019 Ford Flex</a>.</p>

      <p>This month's offer is actually based on four major US markets: New York City, Detroit, Miami, and Los Angeles and only applies to in-stock AWD Limited models. The first offer works like this: $2,500 customer cash plus $500 select inventory customer cash, plus $2,000 in bonus cash, for a total of $5,000 in savings. This deal is limited to the New York City, Miami, and Los Angeles markets.</p>
      <p>The second offer is for the Detroit market and is slightly better thanks to $3,000 in bonus cash instead of $2k, bringing total savings to $6,000.</p>
      <p>Another Detroit market-only special works like this: $3,000 bonus cash plus 0 percent APR for 60 months, and it's good through January 2, 2020. NYC, Miami, and Los Angeles markets are offering $2,000 bonus cash plus 1.9 percent APR for 60 months, again lasting through January 2.</p>

      <p>As <a href="http://fordauthority.com/2019/11/ford-discount-cuts-flex-price-by-6000-in-november-2019/">GM Authority</a> further points out, these remaining 2019 Ford Flex AWD Limited models have been stuck on dealership lots for at least two months. The 2019 Ford Flex carries a starting MSRP of $30,575 while the Flex AWD Limited begins at $36,230. Assuming these new discount offers work as planned, chances are this is the last we'll hear from the Flex.</p>
