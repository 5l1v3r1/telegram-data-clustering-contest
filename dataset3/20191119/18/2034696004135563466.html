      <p>The Scottish singer-songwriter, who released his <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/lewis-capaldi-divinely-uninspired-to-a-hellish-extent-review">debut album ‘Divinely Uninspired to a Hellish Extent</a>’ in May, has enjoyed enormous success throughout 2019 – most recently <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/lewis-capaldi-someone-you-loved-us-number-one-2562055">bagging his first number one single in the US with ‘Someone You Loved</a>’.</p>
      <p>Capaldi has now reflected on his whirlwind year with what he’s called his “most personal” offering to date. ‘Before You Go’ arrived at 5 pm today (November 19) and is set to feature on an extended edition of the singer’s first album, out this Friday (November 22).</p>

      <p>Revealing the inspiration behind the track ahead of its release, Capaldi wrote on Twitter: “The past year has been absolutely wild, didn’t in a million years think all of this stuff would happen to me.</p>
      <p>“Less than two years ago I was lucky enough to get to gig in small pubs and bars back home in Scotland and somehow I am writing this with a number one single in America and getting to play to and meet thousands of ya every night all over the world.”</p>
      <p>He added that ‘Before You Go’ “is by far the most personal tune [he’s] ever written”.  See that post below.</p>
