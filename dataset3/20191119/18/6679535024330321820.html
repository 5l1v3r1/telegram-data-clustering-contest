      <h1>Court allows light vehicles to Pampa</h1>

      <p>A Division Bench of the Kerala High Court on Tuesday allowed private light motor vehicles (LMVs) including the ones with 15 seaters carrying Sabarimala pilgrims to Pampa and back.</p>
      <p>The Bench of Justice C.T. Ravikumar and Justice N. Nagaresh also made it clear that these vehicles should not be allowed to park on the roadside between Pampa and Nilackal.</p>
      <p>The court ordered the vehicles drop the passengers at Pampa and return to Nilackal for parking.</p>
      <p>When the Ayyappa devotees reach Pampa after offering prayers at the temple, the vehicle could return to Pampa and pick the pilgrims.</p>
      <p>The order came on a petition filed by P. Prasannakumar of Alappuzha. He sought a directive to permit LMVs to ply up to Pampa and park at Pampa hilltop, Triveni and Chakkuppallam I and II.</p>
      <h3>Curbs last year</h3>
      <p>The government had imposed restrictions on the entry of vehicles to Pampa last year following the devastation and damage at Pampa in the floods.</p>
      <p>When the case was taken up for hearing, State Attorney K.V. Sohan submitted that the government had taken a decision to allow light vehicles to reach Pampa. Once the pilgrims alight from the vehicles, the vehicles should be taken back to Nilackal for parking.</p>
      <p>The court also said that the order would not be applicable in the case of two-wheelers and they will not be permitted to ride from Nilackal to Pampa.</p>
