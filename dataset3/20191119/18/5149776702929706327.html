      <h1>More than 60 'eyesore' garages across Nottingham will be demolished for car parking or redevelopment</h1>
      <h2>A decision has been made to clear six sites in St Ann's and Aspley</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T18:16:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 18:16</time> by <a rel="author">Jamie Barlow</a></address>
      <p>More than 60 'eyesore' garages will be knocked down across Nottingham for car parking or future development as part of the first phase of a vast clearance project.</p>
      <p>Nottingham City Council has made a decision to demolish 65 garages across six sites in <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/residents-victoria-centre-flats-stepping-3550007">St Ann's</a> and Aspley.</p>
      <p>The vacant land will then be used for car parking or left clear for future building development opportunities.</p>
      <p>Nottingham City Homes (NCH) will continue to manage the land to minimise anti-social behaviour and fly-tipping.</p>
      <p>Some of the garages are tenanted by local residents who will be offered alternative garages nearby.</p>
      <p>A decision has been made to demolish the first six sites - but up to 20 sites have been earmarked for clearance.</p>
      <p>The city council confirmed as many as 280 garages were proposed to be knocked down.</p>
      <p>Several garages near Dennett Close, St Ann's, form one of the six sites to be cleared.</p>
      <p>People living close to this particular plot said more parking spaces would be beneficial - and one resident described the plot as an 'eyesore'.</p>
      <p>Diane Cooper, 61, a carer, of the nearby Flewitt Gardens, explained the garages seemed popular.</p>
      <p>But she said: "To be quite honest, there's that many cars that try and park down there it's ridiculous. They need more car parking.</p>
      <p>"It might not be so at this minute but (at) weekends - Saturday and Sunday - it's mobbed.</p>
      <p>"It's really bad. It's not for me, it's for everybody else."</p>

      <p>Henry Kersey, 48, a support worker, of <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/residents-victoria-centre-flats-stepping-3550007">Dennett Close</a>, said parking was an issue "especially when you have visitors" because it's "not very easy to get a space".</p>
      <p>"They have to go round and find somewhere to <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/traffic-travel">park</a>," said Mr Kersey. "This place is always choked with parking."</p>
      <p>Pete Anderson, 47, of Lytton Close, an administrator, agreed, saying parking could be better in the area.</p>

      <p>"It's all permit parking and sometimes if you have visitors there's no place for them to park," he said.</p>
      <p>A 62-year-old woman, who lives opposite the garages, who asked not to be named, described the site as "a bit of an eyesore".</p>
      <p>"I would be absolutely over the moon, delighted if it was to be used as an open car park," she said.</p>
      <p>Some of the other five sites due for demolition include garages north of Prestwick Close, Aspley, garages east of Pearmain Drive, St Ann's and garages to the back of Tulip Avenue, St Ann's.</p>
      <p>Demolition work could start before Christmas - although this is still to be confirmed.</p>
      <p>Phase one of the project will cost more than £128,000.</p>

      <p>A Nottingham City Homes spokeswoman said: “We are continuingly reviewing the use of and demand for our garages across the city.</p>
      <p>"Where garages are in low demand, beyond economical repair or attracting anti-social behaviour, we identify new options for the sites, usually increased parking or the creation of communal gardens.</p>
      <p>“Anyone who is renting a garage on such a site is offered an alternative garage in the same area.”</p>
