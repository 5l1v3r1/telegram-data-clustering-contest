      <p>Kelowna city council was faced with a housing dilemma Monday.</p>
      <p>Protect the integrity of Harvey Avenue, of approve a low density development that goes against what the city is trying to build up along its major corridor.</p>
      <p>Council chose the former and unanimously said no to a proposed eight-unit, ground-oriented project on a single half acre piece of property just to the east of Richter Street.</p>
      <p>"The clear intent for the area is to allow for larger apartment building," said planner Laura Bentley.</p>
      <p>"We see this development pattern reflected along Harvey Avenue, with Central Green to the west, Executive House, the Evergreens, the Dorchester and Cambridge House to the north of Harvey Avenue."</p>
      <p>Most on council stated they were torn between adding some much needed "missing middle" housing, and protecting the highway for more density, but ultimately sided with density.</p>
      <p>Coun. Ryan Donn said while the city is transitioning to a new OCP, landowners are buying land based on the current document.</p>
      <p>"I worry we are going to knock out a lot of the landowners within their financial capacity to develop if we require that level of development," he said.</p>
      <p>"It sets the stage for only the largest developers in town to afford the capacity to build that out, versus the person next door who essentially has to knock down and built a duplex or four units."</p>
      <p>Coun. Brad Sieben wondered if the proposal before them was turned down, would a duplex be imminent.</p>
      <p>"I too am torn," added Coun. Loyal Wooldridge.</p>
      <p>"For me, looking forward into the future, it's really looking at how we can maximize density on our major transportation routes. As we look to manage our transportation moving forward, I think it's essential that we continue to maximize that."</p>
      <p>"Right project - wrong location," said Coun. Gail Given.</p>
