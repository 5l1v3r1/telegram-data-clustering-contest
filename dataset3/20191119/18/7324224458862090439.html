      <p>Boris Johnson visited a boxing gym in Manchester as he was due to face Jeremy Corbyn in the first televised debate of the General Election campaign.</p>
      <p>Speaking during an election campaign visit to Wythenshawe, the Prime Minister expressed confidence that a re-elected Tory government would negotiate a free trade agreement within 11 months of Britain leaving the EU.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Greens launched their party manifesto, including details of a green new deal, and the Lib Dems pledged to tackle staffing shortages in the NHS by retaining free movement of labour and reinstating nursing bursaries.</p>
      <p>Here are some of the highlights of Tuesday’s campaign trail:</p>
      <p>
        <b>– Boris Johnson has turned to boxing to prepare for his first head-to-head debate with Jeremy Corbyn</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Prime Minister and the Labour leader will be looking to land a decisive political blow on their opponent during the hour-long encounter on ITV.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson donned navy blue “Get Brexit Done” gloves as he tried his hand at boxing during a visit to a gym in Manchester. With Labour behind in the polls, Mr Corbyn will hope to catch his opponent on the ropes as both vie for a knockout performance.</p>

      <p>The party said it will invest around £100 billion a year in tackling climate change, including legislation for a “green new deal” intended to set Britain on track to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2030.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the official launch of the party’s manifesto, co-leader Jonathan Bartley said: “Hitting snooze for another 15 years simply isn’t an option.”</p>

      <p>The £35 million boost, to be delivered over five years, complements party plans for a £10 billion capital fund to upgrade equipment, ambulances, hospitals and other NHS buildings, party health spokeswoman Luciana Berger said.</p>
      <p>The Lib Dems pledged to tackle staffing shortages in the NHS by retaining free movement of labour and reinstating nursing bursaries.</p>
      <p>
        <b>– Labour will increase police numbers to combat wildlife crime</b>
      </p>
      <p>The party wants an extra 82 officers tasked with prosecuting crimes such as fox hunting and hare coursing, at a cost of £4.5 million.</p>
      <p>Officials said the officers would be drawn from within the party’s existing commitment to boost police numbers, so no new expenditure would be required.</p>
      <p>
        <b>– The DUP would not support a Jeremy Corbyn-led Labour government in a hung parliament</b>
      </p>
      <p>Party leader Arlene Foster claimed Mr Corbyn would be bad for the future of the Union.</p>
      <p>Ms Foster predicted that the votes of her party’s MPs could again prove vital in deciding the make-up of the next government.</p>
