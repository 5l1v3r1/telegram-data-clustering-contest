      <h1>'Miracle' spray stops frost building on your car windscreen</h1>
      <h2>For £25 you can wave goodbye to de-icing your car</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T18:57:15+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 18:57</time> by <a rel="author">Rachel Pugh, Jamie Hawkins</a></address>
      <p>Temperatures continue to plummet across the country, meaning many have to de-ice their car in the morning.</p>
      <p>Scraping ice off your car is not what you want to be doing first thing on a cold morning, especially as it can take ages to get rid of it all.</p>
      <p>But, there is a way to stop this from every happening again thanks to a miracle spray, <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/motoring/halfords-ice-fog-windscreen-spray-17239767?_ga=2.184587113.1575759000.1574161914-1735012691.1561448173">Manchester Evening News</a> reports.</p>
      <p>It's on sale at Halfords, and it promises to banish windscreen ice and fog for good.</p>
      <p>A description on the Halfords website reads: "Duxback is a professional-quality car glass treatment that makes driving safer.</p>

      <p>"Originally developed for the airline industry, Duxback causes water to 'bead' on glass, dramatically improving visibility in the rain.</p>
      <p>In fact, if you're driving over 40mph, you won't even need wipers - the water runs straight off!</p>
      <p>"What's more, it makes cleaning much easier, and prevents frost sticking to your windscreen in winter."</p>

      <p>Each treatment costs £25, and lasts up to six months.</p>
      <p>According to Halfords, research has shown that Duxback can increase visibility by 35% in pouring rain.</p>
      <p>What's more, it's claimed, the treatment improves the driver's ability to identify a small object by 25%.</p>
      <p>In winter time, ice will either not stick to the glass or will be much easier to remove, thanks to the product's hydrophobic qualities, it's claimed.</p>
      <p>It even promises to make it easier to remove squashed bugs!</p>
