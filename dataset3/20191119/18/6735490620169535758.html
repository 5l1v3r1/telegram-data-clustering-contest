      <p>“Written and executive produced by feature writer Jeb Stuart (‘Die Hard’, ‘The Fugitive’), ‘Vikings: Valhalla’ begins 100 years after the original series concludes and dramatizes the adventures of the most famous Vikings who ever lived: Leif Erikson, Freydis, Harald Harada and the Norman King William the Conqueror (also a Viking descendant),” notes <i>Deadline</i>. “These men and women will blaze new paths as they fight for survival in an ever-changing and evolving Europe. This is the explosive next chapter of the Vikings legend.”</p>
