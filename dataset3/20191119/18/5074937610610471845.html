      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T18:00:04+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author">Iddi Yire, GNA</a></address>
      <p>Accra, Nov 19, GNA - Dr Joseph Kwadwo Tuffour, Senior Lecturer and Deputy Director, Research and Consultancy Centre, University of Professional Studies, Accra (UPSA), has hailed the Government's decision to make 2020 "The Year of Roads".</p>
      <p>Dr Tuffour noted that one of the biggest challenges facing Ghana was the lack of adequate infrastructure such as roads.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the Ghana News Agency in Accra in reaction to the Government's 2020 Budget and Economic Policy Statement, Dr Tuffour said providing good roads and rails would go a long to accelerate the nation's socioeconomic development.</p>
      <p>Dr Tuffour said bad roads had negative effects on the economy; adding that it makes vehicles to breakdown quickly and sometimes leads to loses of lives through road accidents.</p>
      <p>He said the road infrastructure improvement or development of new ones and enhancement of existing ones was key to Ghana's socioeconomic development.</p>
      <p>"Otherwise it's going to delay a lot of things, cost of production will go up, cost of delivery of supply and other items are going to be affected negatively which is not good for the economy."</p>
      <p>He said bad road networks would negatively affect time lines in conveying food stuff from the hinterlands to market centres, which would in turn go a long way to affect the prices, and also affect the standard of living.</p>
      <p>He lauded the Government's performance over the past two years.</p>
      <p>"If we look at gross domestic product (GDP) growth we see improvement, inflation is relatively better, deficit is being reduced and other indicators have improved; generally, the government is doing well," he said.</p>
      <p>Dr Tuffour said there were two things; what the indicators were saying, which seems to be good but there was also another thing where people actually want to see how it translate into their standards of living.</p>
      <p>"And that is where for me, I say that a lot more needs to be done."</p>
