        <b>Ireland U21 manager Stephen Kenny has named his starting XI ahead of tonight’s crucial Euro 2021 qualifier against Sweden at Tallaght Stadium tonight.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Captain Jayson Molumby returns to the starting XI in centre-midfield after missing the victory over Armenia through suspension while Lee O’Connor is also back after his successful stint with the Irish senior side.</p>
      <p>Troy Parrott starts after his role as an unused substitute on Monday night against Denmark and Kenny will be hoping he will be able to emulate <a href="https://punditarena.com/football/oisinmcqueirns2758/parrott-masterson-goals-ireland-massive-win-sweden/">his two-goal exploits from the last time the two sides met in Sweden.</a></p>

      <p>Conor Masterson returns to the side after injury kept him out of the Armenia game while Nathan Collins retains his place in the absence of the suspended Dara O’Shea.</p>
      <p>Ireland currently sit top of their Euro 2021 group, three points ahead of Italy in second who have two games in hand over Stephen Kenny’s side.</p>
      <p>Sweden sit 4th in the group however they have three games in hand over the Boys in Green and will be hoping to exact revenge for the previous defeat on home soil.</p>
