      <p>Civic officials will not find it easy to be let off the hook if they have allowed unauthorised constructions or violations of building by-laws.</p>
      <p>The State government has come out with a final notifications on the imposition of penalty for jurisdictional officers. Bruhat Bangalore Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) officers and those from other corporations in the State, if found guilty, are looking at a penalty of up to ₹50,000 for the first instance and up to ₹1 lakh for the second instance.</p>
      <p>In municipality limits, an official may end up paying a penalty of up to ₹25,000 for first instance and ₹50,000 the second time around. Departmental inquires can be conducted against officials and stringent action may be taken against officials for subsequent violations.</p>
      <p>The Urban Development Department (UDD) on Friday issued two notifications on the Karnataka Municipal Corporations (levy of penalty on jurisdictional officers for failure to prevent unauthorised construction and deviation ) Rules – 2019, and Karnataka Municipalities (levy of penalty on jurisdictional officers for failure to prevent unauthorised construction and deviation ) Rules – 2019.</p>
      <p>E.V. Ramana Reddy, Additional Chief Secretary of UDD, told <i>The Hindu </i>that new rules, which are already in effect, will act as a deterrent for illegal construction of buildings.</p>
      <p>“In October, the State government had issued a draft notification and received suggestions and objections. Now, the department has come out with a final notification. There are provisions to take stringent action against the officials by conducting departmental inquiry for continued negligence and lapses under KMC Act.”</p>
