      <h1>James Franklin Reacts To QB Sean Clifford Getting Death Threats</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T18:35:23+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 18:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>Earlier today, Penn State quarterback Sean Clifford admitted to deleting his social media accounts following the loss to Minnesota. Clifford said he received death threats, which prompted the decision.</p>
      <p>During his Tuesday press conference, Penn State head coach James Franklin spoke at-length about the his role in supporting Clifford and the prevalence of these occurrences in the era of social media.</p>
      <p>Franklin called the whole issue “troubling.”</p>
      <blockquote>“I’m not going to get into a whole lot of it, but yeah I was involved in it,” Franklin said. “I would hope I’m involved in any of these types of things where our players need support, and then we make sure they get the right type of support. I was trying to be, my wife told me I wasn’t so subtle after the game, but when I was thanking the positive, loyal fans, that’s what I was trying to do.<br/><br/>“I don’t know where we are as a society. It’s concerning. We’re 9-1. We’re ranked in the top 10, I think. We’ve had a pretty good year based on most people’s standards. Sometimes you go on social media and you wouldn’t feel that way. Our players are having to deal with stuff like this. Before I got here, we had a little bit of an issue with [former kicker] Sam Ficken. It’s not just our fan base. It’s all over. I think a little bit of going to this playoff mode that we’re in now has had an impact on it. I think the fact that everybody has a voice, everybody has the ability to contact others is concerning. I don’t know if I necessarily have the answers, but it’s concerning and you see it everywhere.”</blockquote>

      <p>Franklin isn’t wrong about the insane overreactions from every fan base on a weekly basis. They are part of human nature, but social media gives us all a forum to express these thoughts and feelings in the moment.</p>
      <p>If Penn State beats Ohio State this weekend, the same people who were threatening Clifford will be praising him.</p>
