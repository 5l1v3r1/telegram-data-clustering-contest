      <h1>Private companies refuse to take up Egmore museum</h1>
      <h2>Lack of proper policy work cited as the primary reason</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T18:53:32+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 18:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/T-K-Rohit-1505/" target="_blank">T.K. Rohit</a></address>
      <p>A plan to rope in private companies to adopt certain sections of the Egmore Museum and manage them to reduce the load of the financing by the State government has hit a roadblock with not many companies evincing interest.</p>
      <p>“A meeting was held with some of the corporates but it has not progressed beyond that. They are not keen. It is understandable. Another meeting is planned to look at the modalities that can be worked out,” said an official in the State Archaeology Department.</p>
      <p>One of the problems in getting the companies to take up some of the projects is the lack of a proper policy framework that can be put on paper. “Right now, we don’t have that. A proper policy will have to be worked out,” the official said.</p>
      <h3>Budget limit</h3>
      <p>According to officials, a bank from Japan took up a project in the museum complex premises and installed a water tank. “So there’s no issue as such. But companies also have a budget for their CSR activities every year and many of them are based on certain themes each year. So these things have to be looked at,” the official said.</p>
      <p>Minister for Tamil Official Language and Tamil Culture, Ma Foi K. Pandiarajan said the department was looking at splitting up the development work into 52 components and companies would be roped in to help develop and maintain.</p>
      <p>He had said companies such as Ashok Leyland, MRF, CPCL, and a few more had been approached to take up the works that also include developing a lake inside the massive grounds and creating a sculpture park around it.</p>
