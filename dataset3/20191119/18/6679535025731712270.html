      <h1>Security should be a priority in pedestrian underpasses</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T18:48:33+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 18:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Varna-Bhaskar-117233/" target="_blank">Varna Bhaskar</a></address>
      <p>Most of the pedestrian underpasses are either ill-maintained or in disuse. Broken drains and floor, poor lighting, water seepage and lack of ventilation are some of the reasons why people do not use them. Pedestrian underpasses near Hotel Chalukya, Basaveshwara Circle, Nrupathunga Road, Sheshadri Road, and Ambedkar Road have all been locked.</p>
      <p>“In addition to the lack of cleanliness, when I walk towards the KSRTC bus terminal exit, there is often no lighting. It’s dark even at 10 a.m. During monsoon, it is best to avoid these underpasses as they invariably get flooded owing to poor drainage system,” said Savitri Kumar, a resident of Vijayanagar.</p>
      <h3>Several woes</h3>
      <p>However, for many citizens, overflowing drains, hawkers and garbage bags bursting at the seams are the least of their worries.</p>
      <p>“I use the Majestic underpass everyday to get to my workplace. The frequency of garbage removal has to be increased. The lack of bins seem to encourage people to litter. Cleanliness, however, is secondary, as security should be a priority. After 6 p.m., the underpasses become a den for anti-social elements,” said Sumangala Sethu, who works at the SWR’s Divisional Accounts Office.</p>
      <h3>Fairly better</h3>
      <p>The underpass at K.R. Market is one of the few that is fairly well maintained. Apart from ensuring there are no vendors, unlike the Majestic underpass, signboards are placed at regular intervals towards each exit that state that smoking and spitting are prohibited.</p>
      <p>Bins are also placed in the underpasses, while messages cautioning users against littering are painted on the walls.</p>
      <p>“The major problem, however, is seepage of rainwater. Repeated appeals have been made to the authorities concerned, but to no avail,” claimed N. Mohan Reddy, a security guard at the K.R. Market underpass.</p>
