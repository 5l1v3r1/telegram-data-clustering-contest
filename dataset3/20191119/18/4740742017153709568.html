      <h1>The players who could save Bristol City millions in the January transfer window</h1>
      <h2>The Robins have recall options for the start of 2020</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T18:43:55+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 18:43</time> by <a rel="author">James Piercy</a></address>
      <p>With Joe Morrell starring for Wales and Liam Walsh transforming into "Scouse Messi", it's emphasised the level of talent <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">Bristol City</a> possess beyond the confines of the first-team squad Lee Johnson has opted to work with this season.</p>
      <p>Midfielders Morrell and Walsh are two of 12 players out on loan across the Football League and Scotland, with the Robins ensuring plenty of their players are earning consistent minutes outside the limitations of what Johnson can offer them.</p>
      <p>With season-long loans, City have the provision to recall any players they feel could be useful in the second-half of the season.</p>
      <p>The club are increasingly focusing on the January transfer window but incomings could mean more than just new signings, with <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/live-bristol-city-pre-nottingham-3552172">assistant head coach Dean Holden</a> admitting the prospect of bringing one or two back into the fold is a possibility.</p>
      <p>"I'm not sure about the contractual obligations of the loans but it's something we're always looking at, with January fast approaching," Holden said.</p>
      <p>"All those conversations are going on in terms of players in and out of the club and loans in and out of the club; those two (Morrell and Walsh) will come into the reckoning, two lads who are doing fantastic.</p>

      <p>"And not just them, there are plenty of players out there doing great and representing the club and themselves."</p>
      <p>Here are the loanees most likely to win a place back in Johnson's first-team thoughts and ease any pressure on the club to spend significantly in the winter window or free up resources for a major addition in a different position.</p>
      <h3>Joe Morrell</h3>
      <p>"What can you say about Joe Morrell - he's an absolute diamond. He's getting accolades now from the very top. We're absolutely delighted for him," Holden said.</p>
      <p>Morrell's situation is a delicate one for City because the 22-year-old has been an eight-year project now, in terms of his first-team suitability, and decision time is rapidly approaching given he has 18 months remaining on his contract.</p>

        <figcaption>Joe Morrell of Wales beats Nikola Vlasic of Croatia to the ball</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>At Lincoln, Morrell has been given the responsibility of being the team's midfield metronome and has completed 1,260 league minutes, compared with 36 for City last season.</p>
      <p>Not only has that given his a taste for first-team football, it's also thrust him <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/bristol-city-midfielder-joe-morrell-3547379">into the international reckoning</a> for Wales under Ryan Giggs and he's very much a footballer in the ascendancy.</p>
      <p>From City's point of view, as Johnson as repeatedly said, Morrell remains hugely valued but finding minutes for him has been difficult, hence the loan to Lincoln.</p>
      <p>City are well-stocked in midfield with Josh Brownhill, Adam Nagy, Han-Noah Massengo and Korey Smith, which means Morrell would fall from first choice with the Imps to <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/big-interview-joe-morrell-fears-3330022">fifth option at his parent club</a>.</p>
      <p>But unless the Robins can show him a pathway into the first-team, after a breakout season, there's every possibility the 22-year-old will start considering his options.</p>
      <p>As the last couple of months have emphasised, it doesn't take much for an injury crisis to beset a team and if two of the aforementioned quartet were to suffer problems - and all bar Massengo have done so this season - then that leaves the Robins light.</p>
      <p>Morrell is precisely the sort of high-energy, committed and technically-gifted midfielder who could fit into Johnson's preferred 3-5-2 as an anchorman, and he also takes up the home-raised player quotient.</p>
      <h3>Liam Walsh</h3>
      <p>"Incredible goal. He's got that quality in abundance. Fair play to him, he's realised time on the pitch for us is limited and he's going out there and doing very well for <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/liam-walsh-lionel-messi-everyones-3550582">such a big club like Coventry</a>," Holden said.</p>
      <p>Walsh very nearly remained a Robin this season, only moving to the Sky Blues on September 2 and, based on Holden's comments, that switch was as much his decision as it was City's.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old's knee ligament injury sustained just over 12 months ago set his development back and once he returned to fitness, struggled to break back into the first-team picture.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>As Johnson repeatedly said over the summer, playing 40+ games away from BS3 (which he surely will achieve for Coventry if he completes his loan) was more conducive to a full recovery then warming the bench with the odd cameo and cup appearance.</p>
      <p>The same logic as Morrell applies when discussing Walsh's short-term prospects - City have a strong core of talented central midfielders but could maybe do with one more as the season starts to bite.</p>
      <p>But the former Everton trainee's future is a little more pressing as he is out of contract next summer so a decision needs to be made, by him and the club, as there will surely be considerable interest.</p>
      <p>While City remain blighted by an inability to hold onto the ball and control games in the latter stages - albeit mitigated by Nagy's comeback - and Walsh is a midfielder who could provide that.</p>
      <h3>Zak Vyner</h3>
      <p>Another home-raised talent who can help Johnson out with that particular selection issue, as currently it's Antoine Semenyo or bust.</p>
      <p>Vyner's reintegration would also permit Semenyo to go out on loan to a league club and out of the firing line at City, although an extra forward would also probably need to be signed.</p>
      <p>Vyner's development at Aberdeen is interesting because having spent almost the entirety of last season as a right-back with Rotherham in the Championship, he's been deployed in centre midfield by Derek McInnes.</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Zak Vyner during pre-season in Florida<cite>(Image: Rogan/JMP)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Whether or not he has the technical chops to perform such a task at Championship level is unclear but Vyner has displayed himself to be a tactically-smart and flexible footballer whose ceiling probably hasn't been properly identified yet.</p>
      <p>In terms of his value to City he could cover four positions - centre-back, right-back, right wing-back and defensive midfield - and unlike Morrell and Walsh probably wouldn't have the same level of first-team demands.</p>
      <p>City already have one Swiss Army Knife <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/tommy-rowe-credits-former-bristol-3486510">on the left-hand side with Tommy Rowe</a> so why not have another on the right, bolstering the squad and fulfilling that troublesome EFL regulation.</p>
      <h3>Jamie Paterson</h3>
      <p>The attacking midfielder is in a slightly different position in terms of his career to the above trio as he's 27, a senior professional and is well-established at City; so much so his loan departure to Derby County was something of a surprise.</p>
      <p>It's not really worked out for him at Pride Park, <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/bristol-city-paterson-derby-county-3191124">and always looked an awkward fit</a> given his Nottingham Forest connections and the fact that Phillip Cocu probably had very little to do with the signing.</p>
      <p>Paterson has made just five starts with a further five appearances off the bench and outside of a flurry of two assists and a goal in late September, has had minimal impact in the East Midlands.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.bristolpost.co.uk/incoming/article3555538.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_GettyImages-1170579345.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Derby's Jamie Paterson takes on John Bostock of Nottingham Forest in August</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>There was a telling comment from Johnson towards the end of the summer transfer window that implied one or two players in his first team were coasting in terms of their development, and Paterson would potentially fit the bill as an individual who has struck a self-inflicted glass ceiling as a Robin.</p>
      <p>Although the loan is for the remainder of the season, it could have acted as something of a wake-up call for the 27-year-old to kick on at City, as he still has 18 months remaining on his contract.</p>
      <p>City do have a number of playmakers/No10s in Kasey Palmer, Callum O'Dowda and Sammie Szmodics plus Niclas Eliasson in a wider role, but Paterson is a combination of all those type of players and has that x-factor, plus an abundance of experience that would surely be an asset down the final stretch of the season.</p>
      <h3>Saikou Janneh</h3>
      <p>The teenager's <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/torquay-united-saikou-janneh-interest-3394320">agreement at Torquay United</a> only lasts until January, City keen for the striker to get some gametime and build up his fitness after undergoing knee surgery in the summer.</p>
      <p>Janneh was mooted for a loan to League One Doncaster before he suffered an injury and that is likely to be revisited in January but maybe, just maybe, he could also provide something for the first team.</p>
      <p>It's an ambitious notion, given his lack of experience at this level and, similar to Semenyo, he's still in the formative years of his football education.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.bristolpost.co.uk/incoming/article3139136.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_City-JMP_FGR_v_Bristol_City_RT0451.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Saikou Janneh leaps to connect with a header against Forest Green</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>But he's proven he can find the target, is a bright and bubbly character who has been part of the dressing room throughout pre-season and if a striker of a requisite quality cannot be found in January, he's not a bad back-up to possess.</p>
      <p>To revisit a previous point, there is also that obligation of having a home-raised player and although City have placed their faith in Semenyo, why does it have to be just one individual? Why can't it be mixed up.</p>
      <p>As an impact substitute in the last 10 minutes to use when chasing a goal, Janneh has that innate ability to seek space in the penalty area and could be a real wildcard for the Robins.</p>
      <h3>Cam Pring</h3>
      <p>There has been a drip feed of highlights videos from the 21-year-old left-back's time at Walsall and, it has to be said, Pring has looked mightily impressive.</p>
      <p>Almost Joe Bryan-esque in his technique and the way he attacks the ball on the front foot, cutting inside and out before delivering some fantastic crosses.</p>
      <p>Admittedly it's at League Two level but Pring ranks sixth overall in the division for dribble success rate at 67.31% and is 24th for his dribbles per 90 minutes (6.12).</p>
      <p>He's made <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/cam-pring-tipped-save-bristol-2996504">an obvious step up this campaign</a>, having spent 2018/19 at Newport and Cheltenham Town with minimal success, and while it may be a little early to test him back at BS3, given his encouraging development under Darrell Clarke, City aren't exactly strong in terms of depth at left-back.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Jay Dasilva is on the way back from a fractured tibia but his minutes will need to be managed carefully and there's only so long Tommy Rowe can continue in that role before injury and/or a dip in form start to become a concern.</p>
      <p>Pring isn't yet near the level of that duo but could help provide cover in the position and fill in across the FA Cup and, if needed, a few Championship games just to help alleviate the burden slightly.</p>
      <p>Then again, as Johnson will claim, that could prove detrimental to his long-term development and the likelihood is, it'll be next season when we'll truly be able to judge if he is considered first-team material.</p>
