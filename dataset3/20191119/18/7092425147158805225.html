      <p>Production has begun in Belfast on behalf of a new crime-thriller by Derry Girls creator Lisa McGee.</p>
      <p>The Deceived, co-written by McGee's husband Tobias Beer, is a "compelling, sinister narrative of lust, manipulation and betrayal".</p>
      <p>The story centres around Ophelia (Emily Reid), a student who falls in love with her married college lecturer Dr Michael Callaghan (Emmet J Scanlan).</p>

      <p>The character of Callaghan is described as "timelessly attractive and charismatic" with Ophelia considering him as the answer to all her needs.</p>

      <p>Ophelia is then left "trapped in a world where she can no longer trust her own mind", following the affair resulting in a tragic death.</p>
      <p>The cast of the four-part drama, set in both Donegal and Cambridge, include Catherine Walker (<i>Resistance</i>, <i>The Delinquent Season</i>), Eleanor Methven (<i>Derry Girls</i>, <i>Little Women</i>) and Ian McElhinney (<i>Game of Thrones</i>, <i>Derry Girls</i>).</p>
