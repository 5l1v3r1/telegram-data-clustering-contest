      <p>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — Boston’s balanced offensive attack was more than enough to counter South Carolina star guard A.J. Lawson in a 78-70 upset victory on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The Terriers (3-2) had six players with at least six points, led by Javante McCoy with 17, and consistently whipped the Gamecocks (3-1) on backdoor cuts and outlet passes for uncontested 3-pointers. Lawson scored 22 and was in the middle of nearly every big play but got sparse help from his teammates.</p>
      <p>The Gamecocks kept settling for 3-pointers despite shooting a mere 31% from long distance coming in. They were 4 of 22 Tuesday and left nine points at the line, fitting their status as the SEC’s worst free throw-shooting team.</p>
      <p>South Carolina allowed 12 offensive rebounds and Boston scored 18 points off them. The Terriers clinched the game with an 11-2 run after it was tied at 60 with seven minutes to go.</p>
      <p>It was the Terriers’ first win in program history over an SEC team, although they beat current SEC member Texas A&amp;M in 1986, when the Aggies were in the Southwest Conference.</p>
      <p>BIG PICTURE</p>
      <p>Boston: The Terriers posted their first winning streak of the season. They beat New Hampshire Saturday before traveling to South Carolina.</p>

      <p>South Carolina: The Gamecocks suffered a debilitating nonconference loss for the third straight season. Last season’s losses to Stony Brook and Wyoming played a large part in them not getting a postseason bid, despite winning 11 games in the SEC. They lost to Illinois State in Game 3 in 2017-18, another year without a postseason berth.</p>
      <p>UP NEXT</p>
      <p>Boston: The Terriers head to West Virginia Friday before heading to Mexico to finish the Cancun Challenge. The Terriers will play two games there.</p>
      <p>South Carolina: The Gamecocks host Gardner-Webb Friday before going to Mexico. There they will face Wichita State, led by coach Gregg Marshall, a native South Carolinian who attended South Carolina basketball camps as a youngster.</p>
