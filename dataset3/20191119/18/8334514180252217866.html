      <p>GENEVA (Reuters) - Recent protests kicked off by a rise in fuel prices last week have been a security matter and not carried out by the people, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Tuesday in remarks published by his official website.</p>
      <p>“Friends and enemies should know we have pushed the enemy back in the military, political and security war arena,” he said. “This work of these days has been security work, not from the people.”</p>
