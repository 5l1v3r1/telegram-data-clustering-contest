      <p>Private rentals for two-bedroom homes have risen by almost a quarter in the past nine years, according to new figures published by the Scottish Government.</p>
      <p>In the Lothian region, prices have jumped 46.3% from an average of £655 to £972 a month.</p>
      <p>Across Scotland, the average now stands at £668, an increase of 24.6% on 2010.</p>
      <p>The report looked at the cost of two-bedroom homes "because these are the most prevalent size of property in the private-rented sector".</p>
      <p>It found the average amount paid by private renters for a two-bedroom property in Scotland rose by 2.4% between 2018 and 2019 - with prices in the Greater Glasgow area up by 5.3%.</p>
      <p>Over the nine-year period, the average cost in Greater Glasgow has increased by 38.3% to £780.</p>

      <p>Fife and Forth Valley have also experienced rises of more than a fifth since 2010, at 22.1% to £567 and 21% to £596 respectively.</p>
      <p>At the other end of the scale, the increase in the cost of the average two-bedroom private rental property from 2010 to 2019 in Ayrshire was 1.5% to £471 and 1.4% in Aberdeen city and shire to £652 a month.</p>
      <p>Graeme Brown, director of housing charity Shelter Scotland, described <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/lifestyle/family-relationships/how-much-rent-should-you-13076940">rental costs</a> in the Lothian area as "eye-watering".</p>
      <p>He said: "The cost of keeping a roof over your head continues to rise in most parts of Scotland with the average rent on a typical two-bed property in Lothian region now an eye-watering £972 a month.</p>

      <p>"This is putting pressure on household budgets and far too many people are living a precarious existence just making ends meet with the prospect of homelessness looming over them."</p>
      <p>He called for more homes to be built for rent by councils and housing associations, saying: "The answer to this is to keep expanding social housing in Scotland. "</p>
      <p>While he said the first increase in the level of social housing since 1980 had recently been recorded - as a result of more homes being built and an ending of right-to-buy legislation in Scotland - he added: "Worryingly we face a cliff-edge where this will stop in 2021 if we don't get an urgent commitment from Scottish Government that we will keep building."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Labour called for "meaningful intervention" from ministers to stop "inflation-busting rent increases".</p>

      <p>Communities spokeswoman Pauline McNeill said: "With so many <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/calls-rent-caps-number-scots-14278324">low-income families</a> and people living in privately rented homes, these hikes in rent represent a genuine danger of increasing the levels of poverty and deprivation in our communities.</p>
      <p>"It's time for the SNP to admit that rent pressure zones are not fit for purpose.</p>
      <p>"These statistics show that we need meaningful intervention in the private rented sector to stop inflation-busting rent increases causing uncertainty and risking poverty for tenants."</p>
