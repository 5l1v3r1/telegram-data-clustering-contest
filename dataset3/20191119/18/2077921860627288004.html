      <h1>AEW Full Gear Recap: Paste Discusses AEW's Latest Pay-Per-View</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T18:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author">Garrett Martin  </a></address>
      <p>A couple of Saturdays ago All Elite Wrestling held its first pay-per-view since launching a weekly TV show on TNT. Full Gear was capped off by two main events, featuring Cody Rhodes challenging Chris Jericho for the AEW World Heavyweight title, and Jon Moxley squaring off with Kenny Omega in an unsanctioned lights out match. These two matches, vastly different in style and construction, show off both why AEW has been so warmly received by its fans, and how the company gives its performers more freedom to be themselves than the company’s main competition.</p>
      <p><i>Paste</i> Senior Editor and chief wrestling fan Garrett Martin recently discussed Full Gear with Elliott Garstin; together the two of them hosted a radio show in Athens, Ga., about pro wrestling back from 2000 to 2001. Find out what they think about the story of Cody and Jericho’s match and the killer post-show angle, as well as the surprisingly brutal deathmatch that Moxley and Omega took part in, by watching the video below. And tune in to <i>AEW Dynamite</i> on TNT on Wednesday nights at 8 p.m. ET.</p>
