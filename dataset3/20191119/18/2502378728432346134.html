      <h3>Brace yourself</h3>
      <p>Like it or not, the <i>Cats</i> movie is still happening, as was confirmed by the <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ellievhall/new-cats-movie-trailer-second-official">release of its second official trailer</a> today. The <a href="https://nylon.com/cats-movie-teaser-clip">first trailer</a> for the Tom Hooper-directed live action film dropped in July, creating a commotion online as fans of both the original Andrew Lloyd Webber musical and the movie's many marquee-name stars came together in shock and awe at the oddly sexy sight of Idris Elba-as-CGI feline.</p>

      <p>Well, now there's a newer and somehow even sexier (yes, sexier) trailer to haunt the internet. The new trailer prominently features Elba, Dame Judi Dench, and Taylor Swift shaking her kitty bosoms â€” with appearances by Jason Derulo, Jennifer Hudson, James Corden, Rebel Wilson, Ian McKellen and newcomer Francesca Hayward.</p>
      <p>Watch the new trailer below (if you dare) and catch <i>Cats</i> in theaters nationwide on December 20.</p>
