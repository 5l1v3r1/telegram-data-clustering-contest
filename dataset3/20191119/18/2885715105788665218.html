      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T18:46:23+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 18:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/express-news-service/" target="_blank">Express News Service</a></address>
      <p>Vadodara has recorded as many as 782 positive cases of dengue since September this year, as per the official figures of the municipal corporation. Even as five deaths in the city have been attributed to dengue in the past two days, the health department of the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) denies that dengue has caused any fatalities this year, as per the parameters of the government.</p>
      <p>Dr Devesh Patel, health officer of the VMC, said that the five deaths in the city in the last two days were not due to dengue. “The serum samples did not come out positive for dengue in any of the five. In none of the cases did the IgM and IgG tests for dengue antibodies come positive together. Only if both the tests detected in the initial blood sample are positive does it mean that it is likely that the person became infected with the dengue virus within recent weeks. If the IgG is positive but the IgM is low or negative, then it is likely that the person had an infection sometime in the past. So all five deaths could have been due to any other cause. These are parameters of the government to conclude that someone has dengue.”</p>
      <p>According to the VMC record, of the 4,682 samples collected from suspected cases since January this year, 892 have tested positive for dengue and 782 of those cases have been confirmed since September this year. SSG hospital in the city is seeing wards packed with patients seeking treatment for their illness.</p>
      <p>The Congress party, which has been running a drive, Janta Memo, to highlight the lack of sanitation in various parts of the city, has blamed the VMC for the growing illnesses in the city. City Congress chief Prashant Patel said,</p>
      <p>“Sanitation was poor in most of the places we visited since last week. We have been putting out the pictures on social media so that the citizens can be made aware about the fallacy of the Swachch Bharat programme of the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/bjp/">BJP</a> led administration, which is trying to ride on the legacy of <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/mahatma-gandhi">Mahatma Gandhi</a> without actually doing what it takes to make a place Swachch. While the slaughter house in Gajrawadi had cattle carcass all over the place, even the Panchvati canal in Gorwa had dead animals, garbage and filth. This water is also used for drinking. What kind of health will people have in the city?”</p>
      <p>VMC Commissioner Nalin Upadhyay was unavailable for comment.</p>
