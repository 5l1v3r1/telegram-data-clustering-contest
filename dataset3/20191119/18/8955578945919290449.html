      <p><b>TOMSK, Nov 19 – RIA Tomsk.</b><a href="http://en.tsu.ru/">Tomsk State University</a> (TSU) improved its position in the subject rankings of the British publication <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2019/subject-ranking/physical-sciences#!/page/0/length/25/sort_by/rank/sort_order/asc/cols/stats">Times Higher Education</a> (THE) in the direction of "Physical sciences", entering the group of 176-200; among Russian universities TSU takes the fifth place in the subject rating, the university’s press service said on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Earlier it was reported that in the overall rankings of Times Higher Education TSU is in the 501-600 group among world universities and takes the fifth place among Russian universities. As RIA Tomsk was informed in the press service of the university, earlier the university was included in the group of 201-250 of the subject rankings of Times Higher Education in the direction of "Physical sciences".</p>
      <blockquote>"Physics is traditionally strong at TSU, and thanks to the participation of TSU in the "5-100" project, we were able to reformat the scientific work, put the right emphasis for the presentation of our work in the global scientific community. Now we are seeing the cumulative effect of these efforts – TSU is included in the group of 176-200 in physical sciences in the Times Higher Education rankings", – the press service quotes the rector of the university Eduard Galazhinsky.</blockquote>
      <p>According to him, the growth of TSU's position in the subject rankings of THE in physics is the result of many years of university work in CERN projects – from the creation of detectors for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) to the work of the LHC data analysis center, as well as the university's achievements in the field of biophotonics.</p>
