      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/star-wars/">Star Wars</a> X Roblox is the latest crossover between a big-name game and the world’s favourite sci-fi saga, with tons of unique in-game items.</p>
      <p>First it was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/fortnite-battle-royale/">Fortnite</a> and its exclusive <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/star-wars-comes-fortnite-new-stormtrooper-skin-11149604/">Stormtrooper skin</a> and now it’s Roblox with its own Star Wars promotion for new film The Rise of Skywalker.</p>
      <p>Technically the Fortnite tie-in was for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review-thats-not-how-the-force-works-11172882/">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</a>, so there may be more Star Wars to come from Epic Games, but the Roblox deal involves their annual Winter Creator Challenge.</p>
      <p>This year it will take the form of the Galactic Speedway Creator Challenge and will see kids designing and racing their own spaceships and vehicles.</p>

      <p>Winning on the race track will net you a range of limited edition virtual items, including the following:</p>
      <p>• BB-8<br/>• Rey’s Staff<br/>• Stormtrooper Helmet<br/>• D-O<br/>• Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker Hat<br/>• Kylo Ren’s Reforged Helmet</p>

      <p>The challenge is also part of the wider <a href="https://education.roblox.com/en-us">Roblox Education</a> plan to help teach kids how to design their own Roblox game; you can sign up for more information on <a href="https://www.roblox.com/theriseofskywalkercreatorchallenge">how to take part here</a>.</p>
      <p>Roblox recently made the claim of passing Minecraft and Fortnite as the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/05/roblox-passes-minecraft-fortnite-worlds-favourite-video-game-10519467/">world’s most played video game</a>, although as a mixture of MMO and game creation tool it blurs the lines on what a video game actually is.</p>
      <p>There are over 100 million players worldwide though, which might seem incredible to some gamers who have never even heard of it, but its audience is almost entirely children.</p>
