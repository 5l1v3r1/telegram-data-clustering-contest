        <b>The government has launched mobile court drives in Dhaka following allegations of salt price hike due to rumours of a lack of supply.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A mobile court, supervised by Dhaka Metropolitan Police and headed by Executive Magistrate Abdullah Al Mamun, inspected shops at Nayabazar on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The magistrate said they identified a number of shops that were charging extra for salt.</p>
      <p>Four shops were together fined Tk 60,000 for selling salt at higher prices.</p>
      <p>“The process to extend the drive to other areas is under way,” he said.</p>
      <p>Police at Dhanmondi said they were also preparing for such drives.</p>

      <p>The rumour of a salt price hike spread in Sylhet, Habiganj, Gopalganj, Thakurgaon and Netrakona districts on Monday evening following weeks of skyrocketing onion prices due to a supply squeeze.</p>
      <p>Panicked consumers started stockpiling salt, giving rogue traders the opportunity to charge extra across the country, including Dhaka.</p>
      <p>Customers reportedly scuffled at different places in the capital in attempt to buy salt for stockpiling before the rumoured price hike.</p>
      <p>Mobile courts have punished four Habiganj businessmen and three in Netrakona while two have been detained in Thakurgaon and Gopalganj.</p>
      <p>The government in separate statements vowed action against the rumourmongers and unscrupulous businesses, reassuring the people of enough stock and quick arrival of new supply.</p>
