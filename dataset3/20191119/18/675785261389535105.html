      <h2>Senior advocate Addelaid Ferreira-Watt was hit from point blank range when a shotgun being entered as evidence at Ixopi Regional Court in KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa was dropped</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T18:23:40+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 18:23</time> by <a rel="author">Milo Boyd, Jamie Pyatt, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/milo-boyd/</a></address>
      <p>A lawyer was killed when a shotgun being shown as evidence was dropped and blasted her from point blank range.</p>
      <p>Senior advocate Addelaid Ferreira-Watt screamed in agony as she was blown off her feet by pellets which ripped a hole in her left hip.</p>
      <p>Horrified staff in the Ixopi Regional Court in KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa, frantically tried to stop the bleeding as an ambulance rushed to the scene.</p>
      <p>Despite the efforts of paramedics the mother-of-one Addelaid was later pronounced dead in hospital.</p>
      <p>It is thought the blast severed an artery which caused her to bleed to death.</p>

      <p>The South African Police Service is treating the incident as culpable homicide and is working to find out why the shotgun was entered as evidence while still fully loaded.</p>
      <p>A legal friend of the highly respected barrister said: “There is absolutely no need for a weapon being submitted in evidence in a court of law to still be capable of being fired.</p>
      <p>“The weapon and the ammunition that it had contained at the time of the alleged crime should have been submitted in separate evidence bags so someone is in big trouble.</p>

      <p>“Addelaid was an excellent lawyer, a devoted mother and a lover of art and animals.</p>
      <p>"For her to be taken away so cruelly and in such a freakish way is just agonising."</p>
      <p>The victim was from the capital Pretoria and had a daughter Lindsay who is engaged to be married.</p>
      <p>Her sister-in-law Antoinette Ferreira said on her <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> page: “Addelaid died yesterday after being shot in court working as a state advocate. Thank you all for your prayers.</p>

      <p>“A loving and caring mother, a loyal and dear friend, an incredibly smart, intelligent, dynamic resilient and beautiful woman. You filled my life with love and humour.</p>
      <p>“We are so shocked you have been taken away in such a terrible way from your loved ones.</p>
      <p>"A lot strength to you Lindsay – your mother loved you so much” said her relative.</p>
      <p>Elaine Zungo, KwaZulu-Natal director of public prosecutions, said the organisations' "thoughts and prayers" were with the victims family.</p>
