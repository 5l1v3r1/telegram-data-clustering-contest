      <h1>James Franklin Has Massive Praise For Ohio State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T18:03:40+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 18:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>College football’s Week 13 features some massive contests in regards to playoff implications. The ninth- ranked Penn State Nittany Lions travel to Columbus to face No. 2 Ohio State on Saturday. If the Nittany Lions are able to pull off an upset, it would shake up the college football world.</p>
      <p>No one expects Ohio State to lose this game, let alone any of its remaining games. The Buckeyes are currently 10-0, but the next two weeks will surely be the most difficult portion of their schedule. Yet, there isn’t much doubt surrounding OSU’s playoff chances.</p>
      <p>Penn State head coach James Franklin is getting his team prepared for the pivotal contest on Saturday. After watching plenty of film, he’s confident this Ohio State roster is the best he’ll face all season – and perhaps his entire career.</p>
      <blockquote>“Probably the most talented roster we’ve watched on tape definitely this year, and maybe since we’ve been here.”</blockquote>

      <p>That’s some massive praise for Ohio State. Franklin is in for a huge challenge on Saturday, especially considering the Nittany Lions are away from home.</p>

      <p>Penn State’s lone loss this season came on the road two weeks ago. The Minnesota crowd was too much to overcome and provided a boost for the Golden Gophers in the upset win over PSU.</p>
