      <p>STILLWATER — Are you a fan of a black miniature horse who has been spotted around Boone Pickens Stadium?</p>
      <p>Then you’re in luck.</p>
      <p>Turning Point Ranch has made T-shirts of <a href="https://oklahoman.com/article/5640337/osu-football-meet-bb-osus-new-lil-sebastian-who-helps-others-in-his-day-job">BB, the famed miniature horse that appears at every home Oklahoma State football game this season</a>.</p>
      <p>Proceeds from the shirts, which are $25, will go to the ranch, a nonprofit organization founded in 1999 that uses 11 horses — and two mini ones — to build productive futures for individuals with physical, mental, emotional and socio-economic challenges. Shirts are available for order until Dec. 1 at <a href="https://imetbb.itemorder.com/sale">https://imetbb.itemorder.com/sale</a>.</p>
      <p>Fans of “Parks and Recreation” should be pleased with the design.</p>
      <p>The gray shirt features a headshot of BB inside a circle with the words “I Met BB At Boone Pickens Stadium.” It’s the same design made famous in the show when Li’l Sebastian appeared at the Pawnee Harvest Festival, but for OSU fans it’s even better.</p>
