      <h1>Poll: Americans aren’t changing their mind on impeachment despite hearings</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T18:00:03+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 18:00</time> by <a rel="author">Madison Dibble</a></address>
      <p>A majority of Americans said there was no circumstance from <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/watch-live-house-intelligence-committee-holds-next-public-impeachment-hearing-featuring-vindman">the impeachment hearings</a> that would cause them to change their mind on <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress/house-approves-trump-impeachment-process-on-party-lines">President Trump’s impeachment</a>.</p>
      <p>The NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist <a href="http://maristpoll.marist.edu/npr-pbs-newshour-marist-poll-results-11/"><u>poll</u></a> revealed that 65% of Americans have their minds made up about impeachment and would not change their opinion on Trump’s guilt. Just 30% believed there was “any information or circumstances” that could surface in the impeachment hearings that would change their minds.</p>
      <p>Republicans were the most set in their ways, with 78% claiming nothing could change their mind, while 68% of Democrats expressed the same sentiment. A majority of independents, 58%, also reported that their minds were set.</p>
      <p>Overall, 50% signaled their approval of the House impeachment inquiry. Respondents were split as to whether the impeachment effort was “a serious matter” or “just politics,” with 49% calling it serious and 47% claiming it was just politics. The poll showed a similar divide on overall support for Trump’s removal from office, with 49% supporting and 44% opposing.</p>
      <p>Barbara Carvalho, director of the Marist Poll, <u><a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/19/780540637/poll-americans-overwhelmingly-say-impeachment-hearings-wont-change-their-minds">claimed</a></u> the House impeachment testimonies weren’t changing many minds, saying, "We're really not seeing either a backlash or a positive. What we're seeing is people just locking in."</p>
      <p>Several <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/read-opening-statements-from-alexander-vindman-and-jennifer-williams"><u>witnesses have testified in public,</u></a> with many others slated to testify throughout the week.</p>
