      <p>Cristiano Ronaldo has cast further light on his situation at Juventus after he was seen reacting furiously to being substituted by Maurizio Sarri, seemingly taking some of the blame himself.</p>

      </p>
      <p>When the Portuguese was substituted for a second successive game in Juventus' 1-0 win over AC Milan, with his replacement Paulo Dybala scoring the winner, he was visibly upset about being taken off and headed straight down the tunnel, before reportedly even leaving the stadium early.</p>
      <p>He <a href="https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/international/categories/messi-ronaldo-neymar-watch-1/cristiano-ronaldo-breaks-silence-on-maurizio-sarri-drama/667637">has since explained</a> that he has been playing with an injury problem, but does not like to be substituted.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old has now admitted that either him or Sarri could have done a better job of explaining the situation in order to prevent the commotion it ended up causing.</p>
      <p>"In my career, I never had serious injuries, as I usually do between 50 and 60 games, but I am having some discomfort that prevent me from being at 100%," Ronaldo said, as quoted by <i>Marca</i>.</p>
      <p>"Someone should have said something, especially the coach or myself, but you know I don't usually talk to the press a lot."</p>

      <p>Ronaldo also commented on qualifying for the 2020 UEFA European Championship after Portugal booked their ticket following a 2-0 win over Luxembourg.</p>
      <p>"The target was to be in the Euros and we have achieved it," he continued.</p>
      <p>"But the fact that we won in 2016 doesn't mean that we are favourites. We are a team who are difficult to beat, but other sides are the favourites.</p>
      <p>"I am very happy to play in my fifth European Championship."</p>
