      <p>PortaPlay has released a new gameplay trailer for its upcoming story-driven tactical RPG, Broken Lines. The game is set in World War 2 and this trailer will give you an idea of what you can expect from it.</p>
      <p>Broken Lines is a game about a group of eight soldiers crash-landing behind enemy lines, in the heart of Eastern Europe. With no officers, no leaders, and no intel, they must find an unbreakable resolve if they are to survive.</p>
      <p>Here are the gameâ€™s key features:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>Tactical RPG with diverse characters. Experience the story through the eyes of each soldier as they fight for survival in an alternative WW2 setting.</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Turn-based planning with simultaneous execution (WeGo turn-based gameplay)</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Authentic tactical choices: suppression, destructible cover, realistic ballistics, and camouflage are at your disposal.</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Rogue-like campaign structured with different narrative paths, resources, and permadeath.</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>A challenge for even the most experienced gamer. A far-reaching moral system means that the soldiers may desert at any moment if you prove to be incompetent.</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>An emotional story, tense atmosphere, and multiple endings based on the decisions that you make.</i>
