      <h3>What you need to know</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Twitter's PWA has a new update, its first major update since July.</li>
        <li>The update brings several new features, including tabs within the explore tab.</li>
        <li>The update is available for the Windows 10 Twitter app, which is a PWA.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Twitter created a progressive web app (PWA) earlier this year, bringing feature parity across all platforms, including Windows 10. Now, Twitter's PWA has its first major update since July. The update includes several new features, improvements, and many fixes to the PWA.</p>
      <p>Twitter's app on Windows 10 is a PWA, meaning that these changes roll out to Windows 10 users at the same time as everyone else.</p>
      <p>Twitter outlines all of the changes in the <a href="https://twitter.com/i/release_notes">PWA's release notes</a>. A few features of note include an explore tab within the explore tab, which separates content into categories, and the ability to search through DMs. Additionally, you now have the ability to follow topics on Twitter and save searches to help you find content. Here's the complete list of what's new and updated:</p>
      <blockquote><b>New</b> <b>Explore more</b>: We've added tabs to the explore tab to help organize all the content that lives there. Where available, you can use these to check out a variety of categories like news, sports, and more <b>DM Quality Filter</b>: If you have the "Allow DMs from anyone" setting enabled, some message requests may now be filtered out and hidden at the very bottom of the requests inbox. <b>Search DM Inbox</b>: To help you find conversations more quickly, you can type the name of a user or group into your DM inbox and matching conversations will be shown. This only searches your most recent messages, so if you have a lot results may not appear. <b>Bottom Navigation (Mobile)</b>: On mobile devices, the navigation bar has been moved to the bottom of the page. <b>Saved Searches</b>: Crafted the perfect search to find out what's happening on Twitter? Well now you can save it and quickly search it again. Use the menu next to the search box to "Save search", and then find all your saved searches inside the search box when it's empty. <b>Topics</b>: You can now follow Topics on Twitter. Stay up to date with ideas, teams, hobbies and more by following a topic form certain Tweets or searches. <b>Score Cards</b>: Is your favorite team playing? Catch up on the box score with Twitter. In Explore and live event pages, you may now see scorecards from leagues around the world. <b>Translate Profile Bios</b>: In addition to Tweets, if we detect that a user's bio is in another language, you may now see an option to translate it inline. <b>Updated</b> <b>Navigation</b>: Added icons to menus, for beauty. <b>Settings</b>: You no longer need to enter a phone number to use certain 2-factor authentication devices. <b>Settings</b>: Added an "extra small" choice to the font size selector under display settings. <b>Media Viewer</b>: Updated the media viewer to use more of the screen on large devices. Improved various uses around the site to make them more consistent. <b>Timelines</b>: Added avatars to the new Tweets pill to provide more information about who recently tweeted. <b>Broadcasts</b>: Improved the page for watching live broadcasts to be more consistent with the rest of the site.</blockquote>
