      <h1>Liberal Democrat candidate apologises over 'homophobic' tweet</h1>
      <h2>Dan Schmeising insisted that the comments "do not represent my values"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T18:40:54+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 18:40</time> by <a rel="author">Ffion Lewis</a></address>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/liberal-democrats">Liberal Democrat</a> candidate has apologised after offensive tweets from his Twitter account came to light.</p>
      <p>Dan Schmeising is the Lib Dem's candidate for Cardiff South and Penarth - a Cardiff University graduate who is also chair of the UK Young Liberals.</p>
      <p>He is standing on a platform of stopping Brexit and has spoken out in the past about "divisive language" and there being no place for "nastiness" in politics.</p>
      <p>However, he has now faced questions about his own use of language - namely some of his social media posts made prior to him entering politics.</p>
      <p>One them, from 2013, said: "Where the f**k did you go you f****t".</p>
      <p>While another deleted tweet, two years later, read: "She is literally famous for s*****g a d**k, having a huge a**e and rich parents. None of these exactly scream empowering."</p>

      <p>After the screenshots began circulating, Mr Schmeising posted an apology on Twitter.</p>
      <p>He said: "Hey look, it's my turn to be cancelled!</p>
      <p>"Someone's dug up screenshots of very off-colour and not okay things I said in the past on here. I've deleted them because they were comments made in ignorance that don't speak for me now - but they shouldn't have been made in 1st place."</p>
      <p>"I hope people can appreciate that I've done my best to move past the ignorant manchild I was and be a better ally - but I'm still sorry for the person I was then and the things I said. I can't change that, but I can try to be better."</p>

      <p>The apology was criticised on social media by some who felt he had underestimated the severity of his comments.</p>
      <p>One Twitter used commented: "You were homophobic and misogynistic. Say that, not euphemistic 'off colour' (and) 'not okay things' to disguise the severity of what you said."</p>
      <p>However, said while the Lib Dem hopeful's comments were wrong they believed his apology was sincere and that he was "anything but homophobic".</p>
      <p>In a statement later today, Mr Schmeising said: "I'm mortified and upset by the fact that I thought that those things were ever okay to say and apologise from the bottom of my heart for it.</p>
      <p>"They were comments made from a position of ignorance to the injustices that people who are LGBT+ still face on a daily basis and I'm ashamed of myself for it.</p>
      <p>"They do not represent my values. I've learnt a lot since then and I'm trying to be a better ally - but that doesn't change the fact that my comments were hurtful and wrong and I'm sorry."</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the Liberal Democrats said: "We are monitoring the situation with Dan."</p>
