      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T18:37:25+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 18:37</time> by <a rel="author">Paulina Dedaj</a></address>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/military/marines">U.S. Marine</a> being held in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/russia">Russia</a> on espionage charges will remain in jail after his appeal was denied by a Moscow court, reports say.</p>
      <p>Paul Whelan will remain in a Lefortovo prison after a court ruled Tuesday to uphold his December 2018 arrest, when he was accused of being in the possession of a USB drive that contained classified information.</p>

      <p>“The resolution of the Moscow Lefortovsky district court is upheld, and the appeal is dismissed,” the court said in a statement, according to <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/19/moscow-court-rejects-appeal-of-paul-whelan-us-man-held-on-espionage-charges">The Guardian</a>.</p>

      <p>Whelan, who has U.S., Irish, Canadian and British citizenship, was <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/paul-whelan-us-man-accused-of-spying-in-russia-charged-with-espionage-report">arrested 11 months ago</a> while he was in Russia for a friend’s wedding. He believes he was set up.</p>
      <p>He has consistently denied all allegations, going so far as to say that the Kremlin “says it’s caught a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/american-marine-paul-whelan-russia-spy-charges">James Bond on a spy mission</a>” but “in reality, they abducted Mr. Bean ono holiday.”</p>
      <p>The comments came during a previous court appearance. On Tuesday, Whelan appeared via video with the sound turned off.</p>
      <p>Whelan has previously called his a “hostage situation” and has claimed to have lost a significant amount of weight and been subject to abuse — a claim backed by those who have visited him, The Guardian reported.</p>

      <p>Whelan <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/american-marine-paul-whelan-russia-spy-charges">alleges</a> that someone whom he considered a friend handed him a USB stick he believed contained vacation photos. Five minutes later, authorities stormed his hotel and arrested him. The USB stick reportedly contained a list of names of those working at a classified security agency.</p>
      <p>If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison for espionage.</p>
