      <p>DIEGO MARADONA HAS stepped down as head coach of Superliga Argentina club Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata after a little over two months in charge.</p>
      <p>The former Argentina and Napoli great oversaw eight matches at Gimnasia, which yielded three wins and five defeats.</p>
      <p>Relegation-threatened Gimnasia remain third bottom of the table and the news that club president Gabriel Pellegrino will not stand for re-election this weekend has persuaded Maradona to walk away.</p>
      <p>“Maradona stopped working today, he’s no longer Gimnasia’s head coach,” Pellegrino told Radio La Red.</p>
      <p>“Maradona worked in a collective scheme. He said he was here to add, not to rest. He’d love to continue, but he wants unity. It just didn’t happen.”</p>
      <p>Mariano Cowen and Salvador Robustelli will contest the presidency, but Maradona did not wish to continue in Pellegrino’s absence.</p>
      <p>Pellegrino added: “Today’s meeting failed. There will be elections on Saturday. [Diego] Maradona gave his will and he gave his time. He had an enormous will.</p>
      <p>“There will be elections on Saturday and [the candidates] will look for a head coach.”</p>
      <p>Pellegrino was influential in persuading Maradona to resume a fitful and nomadic coaching career.</p>
      <p>Gimnasia were the first team the 59-year-old had led in his homeland since the mid-1990s, when he enjoyed brief spells in charge of Textil Mandiyu and Racing Club while serving a playing ban for a failed drugs test during the 1994 World Cup.</p>

      <p>He spectacularly returned more than a decade later to lead Argentina at the 2010 World Cup, where they were beaten by Germany in the quarter-finals.</p>
      <p>Stints with Al-Wasl and Fujairah in the UAE came before a 2018-19 tenure at Mexican second-tier club Dorados de Sinaloa, which became the subject of a Netflix documentary series.</p>
      <p>Mariano Messera, the club’s former midfielder, will take charge of Gimnasia’s home match against Arsenal de Sarandi this weekend.</p>
