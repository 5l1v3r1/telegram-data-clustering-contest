      <p>
        <b>Squads to choose from:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Nelson Mandela Bay Giants:</b>
      </p>
      <p>J J Smuts (C), Jason Roy, Farhaan Behardien, Imran Tahir, Chris Morris, Junior Dala, Beuran Hendricks, Matthew Breetzke, Onke Nyaku, Ben Dunk, Heino Kuhn, Marco Marais, Grant Thomson, Akhona Mnyaka, Nandre Burger and Dyllan Matthews.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Cape Town Blitz:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Quinton de Kock (C), Wahab Riaz, Liam Livingstone, Moeen Ali, Janneman Malan, Dale Steyn, Sisanda Magala, Anrich Nortje, Asif Ali, Mohammad Nawaz, George Linde, David Bedingham, Vernon Philander, Marques Ackerman, Gregory Mahlokwana, Aviwe Mgijima, Khwezi Gumede.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <b>Playing XI Updates:</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Nelson Mandela Bay Giants:</b>
      </p>
      <p>No changes are expected from the Bay Giants after a convincing win over defending champions, Jozi Stars. Jason Roy and Ben Dunk pummeled the likes of Rabada and Olivier to steer NMG to a nine wicket win inside ten overs. Their bowling unit has consistently provided the goods with Chris Morris and Junior Dala in fine form. Adding Imran Tahir's experience just sweetens the deal for the Bay Giants. Farhaan Behardien didn't feature in the previous game and isn't expected to do so on Wednesday as well. Big hitting middle order batsman, Marco Marais is one to keep an eye on while there will be added responsibility upon Chris Morris to handle the finishing duties.</p>
      <p>Possible XI: Dunk (WK), Roy, Smuts (C), Kuhn, Thomson, Marais, Dala, Morris, Tahir, Nyaku and Burger</p>
      <p>
        <b>Cape Town Blitz:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Similar to their opponents on Wednesday, Cape Town Blitz also has no reason to tinker with a successful combination. Even without Quinton de Kock's contributions, Cape Town Blitz has been able to perform well with the bat. The Blitz have won all their matches batting first with the likes of Liam Livingstone and Asif Ali coming up with useful contributions. Their bowling attack is well rounded with Dale Steyn and Wahab Riaz pulling off a heist against Durban Heat in spite of a Wiaan Lubbe special. Ambidextrous spinner, Gregory Mahlokwana has proved to be a useful asset alongside Linde and will be crucial on this surface.</p>
      <p>Possible XI: De Kock (WK&amp;C), Malan, Ackerman, Livingstone, Asif Ali, Linde, Wahab, Steyn, Nortje, Mahlokwana and Magala</p>

      <p>Nelson Mandela Bay Giants vs Cape Town Blitz, Match 11</p>

        <b>Pitch Report:</b>
      </p>
      <p>In the lone game played at the venue in MSL 2019, the pacers did get some help from the overlying conditions. The batsmen weren't able to score freely although a better pitch is expected for this game. Although a few clouds are expected to make an appearance during the game, there shouldn't be any rain interruptions.</p>

        <b>Fantasy Tips and Suggestions:</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Wicket-keeper:</b> Quinton de Kock has only managed a couple of starts so far for the Cape Town Blitz. He is due for a big knock at the top of the order on what is a competitive wicket to bat on. Along with him, the experience of Heino Kuhn should be a valuable asset as well in the fantasy team.</p>
      <p><b>Batsmen:</b> Jason Roy and Ben Dunk struck form for the Bay Giants against Jozi Stars in the previous game. Both of them scored 81 runs between them and look in good touch as well. Along with Janneman Malan, one or both of them would be great additions to the fantasy side. Asif Ali scored 43 against a very good Durban Heat bowlers unit. He is a viable replacement for Janneman Malan if credits suffice.</p>
      <p><b>All-rounders:</b> Chris Morris has been very economical with the lanky all-rounder picking three wickets as well. While he is a must have in the side for this game, Liam Livingstone is another good option. The Englishman has scored 116 runs so far and should be able to contribute with the ball as well in the middle overs. George Linde is also a viable option if one were to pick an extra all-rounder</p>
      <p><b>Bowlers:</b> Imran Tahir and Dale Steyn haven't lost their wicket-taking ability in spite of retiring from the international cricket. Both of them are viable picks for this game along with Anrich Nortje, who has already picked five wickets so far. One of Nandre Burger or Junior Dala should fit nicely in the fantasy team.</p>
      <p><b>Captain:</b> Quinton de Kock and Jason Roy are the front-runners for this game with both of them looking to go big in this crucial game. With the nature of the pitch taken into consideration, Dale Steyn and Chris Morris are also worth-while options along with the aforementioned duo.</p>
      <p><b>Fantasy Suggestion #1:</b> Quinton de Kock, Heino Kuhn, Asif Ali, JJ Smuts, Janneman Malan, Chris Morris, George Linde, Liam Livingstone, Imran Tahir, Dale Steyn and Junior Dala. Captain: Quinton de Kock, Vice-Captain: Dale Steyn.</p>
      <p><b>Fantasy Suggestion #2:</b> Quinton de Kock, Heino Kuhn, JJ Smuts, Jason Roy, Asif Ali, George Linde, Chris Morris, Liam Livingstone, Junior Dala, Nandre Burger and Anrich Nortje. Captain: Quinton de Kock, Vice-Captain: Jason Roy.</p>
