        <b>Liverpool have been handed a boost with the news that midfielder Xherdan Shaqiri has returned to training with the club after a period out with a calf injury.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Swiss international <a href="https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/first-team/373774-liverpool-fc-training-photos-melwood">was pictured</a> back at the Merseyside club's Melwood training facility today having been restricted to only 29 minutes of action so far this campaign.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old has only appeared four times off the bench for the club, who currently sit top of the Premier League table - eight points clear of the reigning champions Manchester City.</p>
      <p>Shaqiri's last appearance for the Anfield outfit was on September 17th in the 1-0 defeat to Napoli in the Champions League.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/mohamed-salah-andy-robertson-injury-17274638">The Liverpool Echo have reported</a> Mo Salah and Andy Robertson remain major doubts for Liverpool however ahead of Saturday's game against Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park.</p>
      <p>Both are struggling to make the cut after their respective ankle injuries. Joe Gomez withdrew from England's squad ahead of the win over Kosovo in EURO 2020 qualifying due to his knee injury.</p>

      <p>Liverpool's training session today included all players who are not currently on international duty. Roberto Firmino, Alisson Becker and Fabinho are all currently with the Brazilian squad, having been in action in their 3-0 win over South Korea in Abu Dhabi.</p>
      <p>Dutch midfielder Gini Wijnaldum meanwhile has spoken about the importance of the club performing well in the Club World Cup.</p>
      <p>They Reds play Aston Villa in the quarter-final of the Carabao Cup on December 17th, less than 24 hours before they play in the semi-final of FIFA’s worldwide competition in Qatar.</p>
      <p>And Wijnaldum says performing in the tournament in Asia is important for a team that has a strong desire to win.</p>
      <p>"You go into football to make history and that’s what we want to achieve with the team we’re playing in. We have a good team. We are friends, we work hard for each other.</p>
      <p>"We have a team that when we look back later we can say we achieved things. This will definitely be one of the moments when we look back, we can say we achieved something big."</p>
      <p>After this weekend's trip to London, Jurgen Klopp's side welcome Napoli to Anfield in European competition, before domestic games against Brighton and Everton at home, and a trip to Eddie Howe's Bournemouth.</p>
