      <p>A homeless dad-of-three is believed to have frozen to death while two people died in a collision on icy roads as temperatures fell to -10C.</p>
      <p>An elderly woman who had gone missing was also found dead this afternoon and a rough sleeper’s body was found outside the Hilton hotel as a cold snap made its way across Britain.</p>
      <p>The first death was a 57-year-old rough sleeper from Lithuania, whose body was found in a tent in Wakefield, Yorkshire.</p>
      <p>The man, nicknamed ‘Elephant’ by friends, is understood to have three grown up children in Lithuania where he served in the army, the MailOnline reports.</p>
      <p>In the afternoon, police in Scotland found a body of Helen Maider, 89, who went missing in the cold weather at about 6am this morning in East Dunbartonshire.</p>

      <p>The incident happened between the hard shoulder and the first lane, with Thames Valley Police saying ‘driving conditions at the time were foggy and visibility was poor’.</p>
      <p>One hour later, a 19-year-old man was knocked down and killed by a HGV on the A34 near Winchester, with Hampshire Constabulary now probing whether the foggy conditions were also to blame.</p>
      <p>Police officers were also called to assist paramedics from East Midlands Ambulance Service at around 8.20am today, after a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/homeless-man-found-dead-outside-hilton-hotel-freezing-night-11183261/">man collapsed outside the Hilton</a> in Nottingham City centre.</p>
      <p>Three hours before the man collapsed, temperatures were at -2C. He was rushed to the Queen’s Medical Centre for treatment but was later pronounced dead.</p>
      <p>Forecasters say the freezing weather has been brought on by an ‘arctic swell’ blowing from the North Pole to the UK.</p>

      <p>Temperatures in Braemar, Aberdeenshire fell to -9.9C overnight, making it the coldest night of autumn so far for the UK.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Southeastern railway warned commuters that some trains would be cancelled, delayed or revised due to ‘slippery rails’ after wet leaves were squashed onto the tracks by train wheels.</p>
      <p>Nine of the 10 coldest locations were in Scotland last night, but the coldest location in England was Redesdale Camp in Northumberland, where the temperature was recorded at -7.1C.</p>
      <p>According to the Met Office, the freezing fog will ‘linger’ across parts of England and Wales throughout the day.</p>

      <p>Meteorologist Grahame Madge said: ‘It’s going to clear, but it might be stubborn to clear in some places, and then eager to re-form. We have weather warnings out until 11am but in some places it could persist more than that.’</p>
      <p>He suggested drivers take precautions such as driving on main roads, rather than quieter rural routes, and using a cigarette lighter to warm a key if the locks are frozen.</p>
