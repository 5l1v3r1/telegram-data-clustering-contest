        <b>Rumors say that a Fortnite Winter Royale duos competition could be on the horizon. Is there anything to the Winter Royale 2019 rumors?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Fortnite rumor mill has been churning over the past 24 hours with news of a Winter Royale 2019 competition that will feature the duo game mode. According to these rumors, the competition will run through the holiday season, similar to last year’s Winter Royale.</p>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Is there any substance to these rumors? Where did they start and who knows what?</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The source of these widespread rumors seems to trace back to Fortnite coach and commentator <a href="https://twitter.com/DestinysJesus">@DestinysJesus</a>. He tweeted out an image that seemed to be an announcement of a 2019 Winter Royale.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>It’s unclear if DestinysJesus was jebaited or if he knew what he was doing. The original image was tweeted by <a href="https://twitter.com/UPSlLON">@Upsilon</a>, who also tweeted an obviously fake Winter Royale announcement.</p>

      <p>So, the Winter Royale Duos competition is entirely a rumor. There doesn’t seem to be any credible source to these posts that would suggest that Epic is planning on hosting a Winter Royale this year.</p>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>That doesn’t mean that these rumors aren’t based in reality, though. It might not be a “Winter Royale,” but Epic could be planning a duo competition this winter.</p>
      <h3>FNCS Duos</h3>
      <p>The Fortnite Champion Series for Chapter 2 is far from a flawless competition. Teams seem to routinely lose a player when they load into a match, leaving them unable to score points and losing a whole game.</p>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>It could be the number of players in the FNCS squads competition that is causing this issue. It would make sense for Epic to go back to basics with a Duos mode.</p>

      <p>The grand finals of the FNCS squads competition ends on December 8. According to <a href="https://fortniteintel.com/when-does-fortnite-chapter-2-season-2-begin/27796/">what we know about Chapter 2 Season 1</a>, the season will conclude on December 12. That’s four days after the FNCS squads competition will finish.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>It makes perfect sense that the third season of the FNCS will bring us back to duos. What’s more, we’ve already seen a couple of high-profile duo teams announce their intention to play together.</p>
      <p>Mongraal and Benjyfishy have ditched their teammates of Mitr0 and MrSavage to play with one another, for instance.</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/Mongraal/status/1196581251337076737?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <p>Why else would the two players announce their team if they didn’t know something about the future of competitive Fortnite?</p>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>They weren’t the only players to tease or announce a team, either. The previously-mentioned MrSavage teased his teammate announcement on Twitter.</p>
      <p>The other player in the photo was wearing the Fishstick skin, which is likely a troll based on the loss of Benjyfishy.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>All of this is leading to the conclusion that, no, there won’t be a Winter Royale 2019. There will likely be an FNCS duos competition that will take place during the winter months, though.</p>
