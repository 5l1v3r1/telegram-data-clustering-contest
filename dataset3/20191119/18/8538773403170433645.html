      <p>Diego Maradona has resigned as coach of Argentina first division club Gimnasia La Plata after two months in charge and the club on the brink of relegation.</p>
      <p>Gimnasia sit 22nd in the table with Maradona winning three and losing five times out of his eight games.</p>
      <p>Maradona's decision to quit his post comes after Sunday's announcement by Gimnasia president Gabriel Pellegrino that he will not run for reelection. Pellegrino has been at the helm since 2016 and the Argentina legend's resignation <a href="https://www.clarin.com/deportes/maradona-gimnasia-pellegrino-continuidad_0_e2Znwx65.html?">is perceived by the local media</a> as an act of loyalty to the club president.</p>
      <p>"Maradona is no longer the coach of Gimnasia," Pellegrino said. "He said that he was there to add not to subtract."</p>
      <p>The presidential elections are held every three years and will take place on Saturday. <a href="https://www.espn.com.ar/futbol/argentina/nota/_/id/6332362/maradona-dirigira-ante-arsenal-pero-su-futuro-no-esta-definido">Maradona had considered remaining</a> in charge for the last three games of the year but has decided to relinquish the reins immediately.</p>
      <p>"I felt that everyone together... were finding the way for Gimnasia to stay in the first division. This was the moment to keep going with the project and look for the necessary reinforcements," Maradona said.</p>
      <p>"I hope that whoever comes in to manage the club can continue with the work we started and keep Gimnasia where it belongs. I wish you all the best, with all my heart."</p>
      <p>Maradona's departure repeats a well-worn theme in his coaching career. Of the six club sides he has managed, only one job lasted more than a year.</p>
      <p>The only team he managed for longer was Al Wasl of the United Arab Emirates, where he remained for 14 months in charge in 2011-12.</p>
      <p>His previous club job before returning to Argentina was at Mexican side Dorados de Sinaloa, where he left in June after nine months in charge.</p>
      <p>Pellegrino was responsible <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/football/argentina/story/3935914/maradona-hired-at-argentine-club-gimnasia">for bringing the 1986 World Cup winner back</a> to work in Argentina for the first time since 2010, when Maradona left the helm of Argentina's national team.</p>
      <p>Argentinian newspaper <a href="https://www.clarin.com/deportes/maradona-gimnasia-pellegrino-continuidad_0_e2Znwx65.html?">Clarin report </a>that Maradona is also going through a difficult personal time and also has health issues.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, Maradona, 59, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4dH_utlZNB/">played down concerns </a>about his health and stated he was "more alive than ever". Maradona <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/football/dorados-de-sinaloa/story/3875493/maradona-out-as-dorados-managercites-health">left his job as coach of Mexican side Dorados de Sinaloa</a> in June after nine months in charge to focus on his health. He underwent a knee operation before deciding to take the Gimnasia job on Sept. 5.</p>
      <p>After Sunday's game against Arsenal, Gimnasia play away to Banfield on Nov. 29 before hosting Cordoba on Dec. 8.</p>
