      <p>Since departing AC Milan for Molineux during the summer, Cutrone has contributed two goals from 19 appearances in all competitions.</p>
      <p>While <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/sampdoria/"><b>Sampdoria</b></a> are allegedly keen on handing the Italian a chance to return to his homeland, the 21-year-old's representative <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/donato-orgnoni/"><b>Donato Orgnoni</b></a> has claimed that no thought has been given to departing Wolves at the midway point of the campaign.</p>
      <p>Orgnoni told <i>SampNews</i>: "We've never thought of leaving Wolves. I don't understand why certain news comes out. He remains in England 100%."</p>
      <p>Cutrone has a contract at the Premier League outfit until 2023.</p>
