      <h1>Iran to unblock internet once 'abuse' stops: government</h1>

      <p>The Iranian government said on Tuesday it will unblock the internet only when authorities are sure it will not be abused during violent demonstrations against a petrol price hike.</p>
      <p>The Islamic republic has been largely offline since the internet restrictions were imposed the day after the nationwide demonstrations broke out on Friday.</p>
      <p>“Many professions and banks... have faced problems, and we have been trying to solve this,” government spokesman Ali Rabiei said, quoted by semi-official news agency <i>ISNA</i>.</p>
      <p>“The internet will come back gradually in some provinces where there are assurances the internet will not be abused,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We understand that people have faced difficulties... but the bigger concern under the current circumstances is maintaining the country's peace and stability.”</p>
      <p>Demonstrations broke out in Iran on Friday after it was announced the price of petrol would be raised by as much as 200 per cent in the sanctions-hit country.</p>
      <p>At least five deaths have been confirmed in the violence that has seen masked young men set alight petrol stations, banks and other public property.</p>
      <p>The full extent of the protests remains unclear, however, largely as a result of the internet restrictions. The outage has stemmed the flow of videos shared on social media of demonstrations or associated acts of violence.</p>
      <p>Netblocks, a website that monitors global net shutdowns, said internet connectivity in Iran was at four per cent on Tuesday compared with normal levels.</p>
      <p>“Sixty-five hours after #Iran implemented a near-total internet shutdown, some of the last remaining networks are now being cut,” it said on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Iran's economy has been battered since May last year when President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the US from a 2015 nuclear agreement and reimposed crippling sanctions.</p>
