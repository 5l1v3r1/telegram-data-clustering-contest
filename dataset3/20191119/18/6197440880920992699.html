      <h1>JerryRig’s latest teardown shows what a clear-backed Pixel 4 XL would look like</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T18:33:55+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 18:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5google.com/author/hallstephenj/" target="_blank">Stephen Hall</a></address>
      <p>iFixit <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/10/24/pixel-4-xl-teardown-samsung-display/">treated the Pixel 4 XL to a full teardown</a> not long after the device’s announcement, but one could say that one was a bit too careful. And professional. The latest Pixel 4 XL teardown from JerryRig is definitely a bit more on the messy and fun side, and gives us another look at various internal components and a clear back.</p>
      <p>First, Zack pulls apart the back glass housing and shows how colored glass works on just about every phone. If you didn’t know, non-clear smartphone glass usually gets its color by internal paint, which means you can scrape off the paint to easily make a clear-backed device.</p>
      <p>Last year, JerryRigEverything showed a Pixel 3 that looked pretty stunning, but this year he says that the 4 XL looks a bit like it let itself go. He also notes that, well, going all-clear on your Pixel 4 XL back might not be the best of ideas and drops some shade for Pixel 4 XL resell values.</p>
      <blockquote>Making your phone clear will void the warranty, so if you wanna do this wait til your phone drops in value, which for the Pixel it’s like two weeks…</blockquote>
      <p>He also takes a closer look at the Soli radar chip, the camera housing, the electronics that power the Google Pixel 4’s Active Edge feature, the acceptably-large Pixel 4 XL battery, and more.</p>

      <p>There’s not much else new in this teardown, but Zack does rip the phone to shreds in the most earbleed-prone way possible; definitely don’t watch this video if you don’t want your skin to crawl when he scratches his razor up against the various internal metal and glass fixings…</p>
