      <p>BALTIMORE — The Baltimore Museum of Art will add only artwork created by women to its permanent collection in 2020.</p>
      <p>Museum director Christopher Bedford announced the policy Thursday, saying something radical must be done to rectify centuries of imbalance.</p>
      <p>The Maryland museum acquired its first work by a female artist in 1916, two years after it was founded and three years before women gained the right to vote in the US.</p>
      <p>Today, only 4 percent of the 95,000 pieces in its permanent collection were created by women.</p>
      <p>News outlets report each of the museum’s exhibits will be strongly tied to women. Nineteen will showcase art solely by women, including at least one transgender artist.</p>
      <p>Bedford says the museum is working to “correct our own canon” and address historical blind spots.</p>
