      <p><b>New York:</b> A US national security official was so alarmed by US President Donald Trump's behaviour on his infamous phone call with the Ukrainian president that he believed it was his "duty" to quickly report it to a White House lawyer.</p>
      <p>Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, a decorated military veteran responsible for co-ordinating US policy on Ukraine, said he reported the call because he feared that Ukraine was being drawn into a "partisan play" to benefit Trump politically.</p>

      <p>Vindman and State Department official Jennifer Williams appeared before the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday (Wednesday AEDT) for the impeachment inquiry into Trump.</p>
      <p>They were the first witnesses to publicly testify about first-hand knowledge of the July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.</p>
      <p>"I was concerned by the call," Vindman told the committee. "What I heard was inappropriate. It was improper for the president of the United States to demand a foreign government investigate a political opponent."</p>

      <p>He officially reported his concerns to John Eisenberg, the top lawyer at the National Security Council.</p>
      <p>Vindman said he had already alerted Eisenberg to concerns about<a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p537wy.html"> Gordon Sondland, the US ambassador to the European Union, telling Ukrainian officials they would need to launch</a> politicial investigations in order for Zelensky to receive a White House meeting with Trump .</p>
      <p>Explaining his decision, Vindman said: "It was my duty to report my concerns to the proper people in the chain of command.</p>
      <p>"It was also clear that if Ukraine pursued an investigation into the 2016 election, the Bidens, and Burisma, it would be interpreted as a partisan play.</p>

      <p>"This would undoubtedly result in Ukraine losing bipartisan support, undermine US national security, and advance Russia’s strategic objectives in the region."</p>
      <p>During last week's hearings, Republicans attacked Democrats for relying on hearsay evidence from witnesses who did not have first-hand knowledge of key events. That was not possible for Vindman and Williams, who both listened to the Trump-Zelensky call in real time.</p>
      <p>Williams, who serves as an adviser to Vice President Mike Pence, testified that she found the president’s call unusual because it included discussion of a "domestic political matter".</p>
      <p>Vindman said the subsequent decision to place the transcript of the phone call on a top-secret server did not represent anything "nefarious" or "unprecedented", despite being described by senior Democrats as evidence of a "cover-up" at the time.</p>

      <p>"My understanding is that this was viewed as a sensitive transcript, and to avoid leaks ... it should be segregated to a smaller group of folks," he said.</p>
      <p>"I just understood that they wanted to keep it into a smaller group."</p>
      <p>Republicans on the committee confronted Vindman with critical testimony from other officials, including a former supervisor saying he had questionable judgment.</p>
      <p>Vindman responded with a recent performance review in which he was described as "brilliant, unflappable, and exercises excellent judgment".</p>
