      <p>Hollywood, CA – <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53482/title.luh-kel-drops-debut-project-mixed-emotions">Luh Kel</a> has shared his two cents on who rightfully deserves the “King of R&amp;B” title. During a conversation with HipHopDX, the 17-year-old singer said <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/search?q=justin+bieber&amp;submit=">Justin Bieber</a>‘s talent is unmatched.</p>
      <p>Initially, Kel shot down claims there even is a “King of R&amp;B.” The Tennessee native stated he shouldn’t look at others in that light while he’s working towards the title.</p>
      <p>“No king, especially not for me,” he began. “If I do music and I do R&amp;B, why would I call somebody else a king? You know what I’m saying? I’m trying to be a king.”</p>

      <p>But later on, Kel backpedaled on his previous statement when he shared his thoughts on Bieber. The “Wrong” singer is hopeful he will have the chance to collaborate with Bieber, who he gave the crown.</p>
      <p>“I would love to make a song with Justin Bieber,” Kel noted. “He legendary to me. Matter of fact, he the king. The throne, I’m handing it [to him]. You got it, Bieber.”</p>
      <p>Last week, Kel dropped his debut project <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53482/title.luh-kel-drops-debut-project-mixed-emotions"><i>Mixed Emotions</i></a>. The 12-track effort features guest appearances from PnB Rock, Jay Gwuapo and IV Jay.</p>
