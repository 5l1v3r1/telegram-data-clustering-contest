      <h1>I want to have a joint album with Strongman – Teephlow</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T18:18:26+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 18:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.ghbase.com/author/adu/" target="_blank">Adu Sarpeah</a></address>
      <p>Rapper <a href="http://www.ghbase.com/teephlow-details-what-prevented-him-from-adding-his-voice-to-medikal-strongman-recent-beef/">Teephlow</a> and Strongman are not the best of friends taking into consideration their recent lyrical war. Regardless, Teephlow wants to act mature by calling on his arch-rival to squash their beef and work on a project.</p>
      <p>Speaking to NYDJ of Kumasi-based YFM fame, Teephlow said he desires to work on a joint album with <a href="http://www.ghbase.com/strongman-hustled-hard-for-his-car-unlike-some-criminals-awal-lauds-strongman-and-indirectly-shades-medikal/">Strongman</a> someday. He argued that they are the best rappers in Ghana currently.</p>
      <p>“I actually have a collaboration with Strongman, but it was like a regional thing I did…I had this song that was one of the songs that projected me into the limelight. The titled is Brother; it was really big in the Central and Western regions. So I was trying to explode it and I pick people from other regions and Strongman was the one I picked from the Ashanti Region. What we did was dope…but then I think people are mainly looking for a rap song and I am all for it…if we are to meet at the studio and do it today I am ready,” he stated.</p>
      <p>Teephlow added: “I feel like we have to do a joint EP, sell it and embark on tours.”</p>
      <p>The ‘State of the art’ composer stressed that he cannot wait to see this collaboration coming to pass.</p>
