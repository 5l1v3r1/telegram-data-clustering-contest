      <p>Despite making just 22 starts and 35 substitute outings since his arrival in 2017, Hayes remains wanted by the Scottish giants, who are keen to extend his contract past the end of the season.</p>
      <p>However, according to <i>The Sun</i>, the uncertainty regarding his future has led to interest from two clubs in the Championship.</p>
      <p>While Swansea and Stoke have ambitions at either end of the table, both teams are said to be keen on securing the 32-year-old's services in January.</p>
      <p>The Irishman is no stranger to English football having represented six different clubs before making the switch to Inverness Caledonian Thistle in 2009.</p>
