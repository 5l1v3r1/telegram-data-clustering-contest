      <p>The US aircraft carrier strike group Abraham Lincoln sailed through the vital Strait of Hormuz on Tuesday, US officials told Reuters, amid simmering tensions between Iran and the United States.<br/><br/>Tensions in the Gulf have risen since attacks on oil tankers this summer, including off the UAE coast, and a major assault on energy facilities in Saudi Arabia.<br/><br/>Washington has blamed Iran, which has denied being behind the attacks on global energy infrastructure.<br/><br/>The commander overseeing US naval forces in the Middle East told Reuters in May that he would send an aircraft carrier through the Strait of Hormuz if needed.<br/><br/>In a statement on Tuesday, the Navy said the Lincoln transited through the Strait into the Gulf.<br/><br/>About a fifth of the worldâ€™s oil passes through the Strait of Hormuz.<br/><br/>The United States has deployed thousands of additional military forces in the Middle East, including bombers and air defense personnel, to act as a deterrent against what Washington says is provocative Iranian behavior.</p>
