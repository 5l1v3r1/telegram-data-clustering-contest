      <h1>Trump says Republicans ‘absolutely killing it’ at ‘scam’ impeachment hearing</h1>

      <p>President Trump on Tuesday applauded Republicans for a job well done and tweeted a video slamming the whistleblower’s lawyer as <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/19/trump-impeachment-hearings-livestream-watch-day-3-of-public-testimony/">Day 3 of impeachment hearings</a> got underway.</p>
      <p>“Republicans are absolutely killing it,” Trump said at a Cabinet meeting at the White House. “Because it’s a big scam.”</p>
      <p>At the end of the meeting, he called the inquiry a “kangaroo court” headed by “little shifty Schiff,” referring to House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, D-California.</p>
      <p>The commander-in-chief also <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1196832113447845889">tweeted a 30-second campaign video</a> blasting Mark Zaid, the lawyer representing the whistleblower whose complaint led to the impeachment inquiry.</p>
      <p>“This impeachment is a charade. Just 10 days after President Trump was inaugurated, the whistleblower’s lawyer Mark Zaid tweeted that the coup has started and impeachment will follow,” the clip says. “The Democrats are trying to overthrow President Trump … Don’t let them.”</p>
