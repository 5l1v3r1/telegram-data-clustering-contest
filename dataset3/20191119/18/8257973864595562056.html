      <p>Nov. 19 (UPI) -- Netflix is giving a glimpse of RuPaul in the new series <i>AJ and the Queen</i>.</p>
      <p>The streaming service released a <a href="https://twitter.com/seewhatsnext/status/1196836987790974977">teaser</a> Tuesday on Twitter featuring RuPaul as Ruby Red, a drag queen traveling from club to club across the U.S. with AJ (Izzy Gaspersz), a scrappy 11-year-old orphan.</p>
      <p>The sneak peek shows RuPaul take the stage as Ruby Red in a number of fiery looks and a white and silver ensemble.</p>
      <p>"RuPaul stars as Ruby Red in #AJAndTheQueen, a new scripted comedy series premiering January 10!" the caption reads.</p>
      <p><i>AJ and the Queen </i>is created by RuPaul and <i>Sex and the City</i> writer and producer Michael Patrick King. The show co-stars Michael Leon-Wooley, Josh Segarra, <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Tia_Carrere/?tps=1">Tia Carrere</a> and Katerina Tannenbaum.</p>
      <p>RuPaul said in an interview <a href="https://www.interviewmagazine.com/culture/justice-is-served-a-conversation-between-rupaul-and-judge-judy">with Interview</a> magazine in August that filming <i>AJ and the Queen</i> was an emotional experience.</p>
      <p>"My character parents an 11-year-old child, so I was able to really emotionally revisit myself as a kid. It was a trip. I've never done anything like that before. It was the most challenging thing for me as an actor and as a human," the star shared.</p>
      <p>"The big thing for me is that I wish I'd learned how to process feelings earlier," he said. "The human body is kind of like a computer program, and a lot of the feelings that I felt were based on the experiences I'd had. Knowing that feelings are not facts was a message I wish that 11-year-old Ru had heard."</p>
      <p>RuPaul is known for hosting the VH1 reality competition<i> RuPaul's Drag Race</i>. The new spinoff <i>RuPaul's Celebrity Drag Race</i> <a href="https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/TV/2019/10/23/VH1-announces-RuPauls-Celebrity-Drag-Race-will-arrive-in-2020/9641571840610/">will premiere on VH1</a> in 2020.</p>
