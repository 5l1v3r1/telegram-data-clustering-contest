      <h1>Clarke Oduor yet to prove point to Leeds after summer exit</h1>

        <b>One of the most surprising pieces of business Leeds United signed off on during the summer was the decision to allow Clarke Oduor to leave Elland Road on a permanent basis.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Oduor was excellent for the under-23s last season. And it appeared that he was gearing up for an important campaign with the Whites as he was included in the squad that Marcelo Bielsa took to Australia in pre-season.</p>

      <p>However, the 20-year-old would end the transfer window a Barnsley player. Bielsa shed some light on the 20-year-old’s exit as he suggested that he wanted Oduor to stay but gave him the option to move on as he was well aware of the competition on the left-hand side (via <a href="https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/sport/football/leeds-united/latest-leeds-united-news/leeds-united-head-coach-marcelo-bielsa-explains-decision-allow-clarke-oduor-join-barnsley-631317">Yorkshire Evening Post</a>).</p>
      <p>Leeds fans may have been wary that the club would rue Oduor’s departure. However, he went into the international break still awaiting the chance to make his first-team debut for the Tykes.</p>

      <h3>Oduor yet to prove point</h3>
      <p>And it is surely fair to say that Oduor is yet to prove a point to his former club after featuring for Barnsley’s under-23s as they were beaten 2-0 by Leeds on Monday.</p>
      <p>Of course, Oduor’s involvement in the game says little about his role in the squad. It is a good opportunity to give players minutes during the international break. Leeds had first-team stars such as Barry Douglas and Pablo Hernandez featuring.</p>
      <p>But it seems to be a good chance to take early stock of how successful his move has been as he was playing against his former club.</p>
      <p>Oduor has the potential to be a fantastic signing for Barnsley. But given that he is yet to make a first-team debut for a side sitting bottom of the Championship, he would perhaps be forgiven for giving some thought to whether he made a mistake leaving Leeds.</p>
