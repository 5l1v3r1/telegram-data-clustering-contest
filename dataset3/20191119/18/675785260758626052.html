      <h1>BBC lose The Masters TV rights as Sky Sports land exclusive Augusta coverage</h1>
      <h2>The BBC have broadcast live from Augusta for the past 52 years, but that will end when the first Major of the 2020 season reaches the weekend next year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T18:55:17+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 18:55</time> by <a rel="author">Neil McLeman, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/neil-mcleman/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/bbc">The BBC</a> will show no live golf outside the Olympics next year after losing the rights at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/the-masters">The Masters.</a></p>
      <p>The Beeb has broadcast live from Augusta since 1967.</p>
      <p>But the corporation has only had the live rights to show weekend action since 2011 and now Sky Sports have won an exclusive deal to show the first Major of the season from 2020.</p>
      <p>The BBC will still show TV highlights and provide radio and online coverage but it is the latest blow to their dwindling sporting portfolio which lost the Open in 2016.</p>

      <p>A BBC spokesperson said: “We continue to operate in a period of huge financial restraint and as such, all sport rights decisions must be scrutinised closely.</p>
      <p>"Our audiences will still be able to follow the Masters extensively across BBC radio and on the BBC Sport website, in addition to the daily television highlights.”</p>
      <p>Unlike the FA Cup final and Wimbledon finals, golf events are not on the "crown jewels" list of sports reserved for terrestrial television.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tiger-woods">Tiger Woods</a> claimed his fifth Green Jacket in emotional style at The Masters this year.</p>
      <p>Sky Sports managing director Rob Webster said: “The Masters has provided some spectacular moments on Sky Sports - not least Tiger Woods' unforgettable comeback this year - and we look forward to broadcasting many more at one of the most iconic global sporting events.”</p>
      <p>Sky's live coverage will also include the Par 3 Contest, as well as a daily practice range show featuring interviews and analysis from the Tournament Practice Area.</p>
      <p>Sky will offer supplementary coverage via the ‘Featured Groups’ along with ‘Amen Corner’ and ‘15 and 16’ live feeds, airing Thursday through Sunday.</p>
