      <p>A tabloid claims <b>Kim Kardashian</b> is worried about <b>Kanye West</b>’s mental state to the point where she believes he could “snap” at any moment and even “kill her.” The story is as false as it is appalling. <b>Gossip Cop</b> can correct it.</p>
      <p>According to <i><b>NW</b></i>, the reality star wants her husband detained in a psychiatric hospital because she fears he may be a danger not only to himself, but to her and their four kids. “Kim is frantic at the thought that Kanye’s going to do something crazy and kill her,” an alleged source tells the outlet. “His behavior and angry outbursts have become so bad that Kim’s petrified to leave the children with him unattended.”</p>
      <p>The supposed insider further alleges that Kardashian is terrified of sleeping alone in the house with her husband, so she’s asked her mom, Kris Jenner, and her mom’s boyfriend, Corey Gamble, to temporarily move in with them. “Kim’s biggest fear is that Kanye may wake up in the night in one of his crazed moods and stab her in her sleep,” says the seemingly nonexistent tipster.</p>
      <p>From there, the “source” maintains that Kardashian is “contemplating” whether or not to pull the plug on their five-year marriage. So, the reality star is concerned that her husband might murder her in her sleep, but she’s only “contemplating” a divorce? Seems like a pretty easy decision to make if any of this were true, which it isn’t.</p>
      <p>Although West has been open about his struggles with mental health and bipolar disorder, the idea that he’d ever harm his family is outrageously untrue. <b>Gossip Cop</b> checked in with a source close to the situation, who dismissed the tabloid’s report as nonsense. Kardashian isn’t scare of her husband, nor does she believe she’s in danger being with him.</p>
      <p>In fact, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5DQE0fgDYO/">Kardashian posted an Instagram photo of her and West</a> on Tuesday, along with the caption, “Just a post to say I love him so much.” The post was apropos of nothing other than a wife’s love for her husband, who’s a devoted father. In addition to that post, Kardashian frequently praises her husband and shares photos of the two spending quality time with their children.</p>
      <p>Just a few of weeks ago, <i>People</i> magazine provided a much more accurate picture of the couple’s marriage. The trusted celebrity news outlet noted that <a href="https://people.com/tv/kim-kardashian-doesnt-want-kanye-west-to-change-despite-opinions/">Kardashian “doesn’t want to change” West</a> despite his outspoken opinions. The reputable publication added, “Kim and Kanye are in such a great place right now… She loves him and supports him.” Kardashian has been by her husband’s side amid his mental health struggles over the years, and while <b>Gossip Cop</b> will acknowledge that the rapper has been prone to having meltdowns, there’s never been any indication he’s prone to violence.</p>
      <p>Just last month, <b>Gossip Cop</b> busted the outlet for falsely claiming <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-taking-kids-baptism/">Kardashian was walking out on West and taking their kids with her</a>. That obviously didn’t happen. In October 2018, the publication swore <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/kanye-west-kim-kardashian-moving-chicago-son-saint/">West had “dumped” Kardashian and was moving to Chicago</a> with their son Saint. That didn’t happen either. This latest article is equally fictional, in addition to being startlingly over the top.</p>
