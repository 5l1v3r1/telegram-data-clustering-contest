      <h2>President Donald Trump appeared publicly on Tuesday, squashing conspiracy theories that he had suffered severe health problems.</h2>

      <p>The president berated the news media for speculating about his health without evidence after he made an unscheduled visit to Walter Reed hospital.</p>
      <p>“These people are sick, they’re sick, the press really in this country is dangerous,” Trump said.</p>
      <p>The president hosted a cabinet meeting at the White House and publicly addressed the media on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
      <p>He recalled traveling to Walter Reed hospital for a “very routine physical” and then returning home to find out that CNN and other media outlets were questioning whether he had a heart attack.</p>
      <p>Trump said he also visited with a few soldiers being treated at the military hospital.</p>
      <p>“I get greeted by the news, ‘We understand that you had a heart attack,'” Trump said, recalling the reports of “massive chest pains” featured on CNN.</p>
      <p>The president criticized the press for running the speculative stories, calling it “dangerous” for the United States.</p>
      <p>“We don’t have freedom of the press in this country, we have the opposite, we have a very corrupt media and I hope they can get their act straightened out because it’s very very bad and very dangerous to this country,” Trump said.</p>
      <p>The reports fueled speculation from leftists such as Michael Moore, who questioned why the president had not been seen since he first went to the hospital.</p>
