      <h1>Philadelphia Eagles to host final minutes of high school playoff game after shooting suspended play</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T17:24:10+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 17:24</time> by <a rel="author">Paulina Dedaj</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl/philadelphia-eagles">Philadelphia Eagles</a> are helping two <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/northeast/new-jersey">New Jersey</a> high school <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nfl">football</a> teams play out the final 17 minutes of a playoff game that was cut short over the weekend because of a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/at-least-2-injured-in-shooting-at-nj-high-school-football-playoff-game">shooting that critically injured a 10-year-old boy</a>.</p>
      <p>The Eagles offered to host Pleasantville and Camden high school at Lincoln Financial Field on Nov. 30 to complete their playoff game, which came to a sudden stop Friday evening when gunfire erupted.</p>
      <p>“It’s extremely unfortunate that a senselessly violent act has impacted this game, and there will certainly be a wide range of emotions along both sidelines. However, thanks to the Eagles’ generosity and community spirit, Pleasantville and Camden student-athletes and their families will have an opportunity to write their own ending to this game,” Larry White, executive director of the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association, said in a <a href="https://www.njsiaa.org/events-news-media/news/update-pleasantville-hs-and-camden-hs-football-game">news release.</a></p>
