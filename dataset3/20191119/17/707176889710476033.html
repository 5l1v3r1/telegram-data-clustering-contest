      <h1>Epstein jail guards accused of dereliction of duty</h1>
      <h2>Prosecutors allege the pair failed to check on sex offender before his suicide</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T17:19:05+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 17:19</time> by <a rel="author">Kadhim Shubber</a></address>
      <p>Two prison guards on duty the night of Jeffrey Epstein’s death have been charged with falsifying records after allegedly sleeping on the job and browsing the internet instead of checking on the sex offender in the lead-up to his suicide.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors claimed that Tova Noel and Michael Thomas had failed to conduct half-hourly checks on Epstein’s unit for eight hours on the night of his death, instead spending “substantial portions” of their shift at their desks.</p>
      <p>“They repeatedly failed to conduct mandated checks on inmates, and lied on official forms to hide their dereliction,” Geoffrey Berman, the US attorney for the southern district of New York, said in a statement on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Epstein’s body was <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a34f9e1e-bb77-11e9-b350-db00d509634e">found</a> at 6:30am on August 10 at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York, where he was awaiting trial on charges of sex trafficking minors. He had <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6c4c6e86-c065-11e9-b350-db00d509634e">committed suicide</a> by hanging, according to the official coroner’s report.</p>
      <p>The charges against Ms Noel and Mr Thomas said the two jail guards had found Epstein “alone in his cell and not responsive, with a noose around his neck”. Prosecutors said no one had entered the floor Epstein was housed on between 10:30pm and 6:30am the night of his death.</p>
      <p>“We messed up,” Mr Thomas is alleged to have told a supervisor after discovering Epstein’s body. “I messed up, she’s not to blame, we didn’t do any rounds,” the indictment quoted him as saying, in reference to Ms Noel.</p>
      <p>Ms Noel and Mr Thomas surrendered on Tuesday morning. Their attorneys did not immediately return emails seeking comment.</p>

      <p>The charges follow widespread outrage at Epstein’s death, along with scepticism that he actually killed himself. On Tuesday, Senator John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana, told the director of the Bureau of Prisons, Kathleen Hawk Sawyer, that the public wanted a full accounting of Epstein’s death.</p>
      <p>“Xmas ornaments, drywall, and Jerry Epstein. Name 30 things that don’t hang themselves. That’s what the American people think. That’s what the American people think, and they deserve some answers,” the senator said.</p>
      <p>Lindsey Graham, the Republican chairman of the Senate judiciary committee, asked: “With a case this high-profile, there’s got to be either major malfunction of the system or a criminal enterprise at foot to allow this to happen, so are you looking at both? Is the FBI looking at both?”</p>
      <p>Ms Hawk Sawyer, who was <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0f683656-c2a8-11e9-a8e9-296ca66511c9">appointed</a> director following Epstein’s death, told the committee she had no evidence to suggest that the death was not a suicide.</p>
      <p>She declined to discuss the specifics of the case, citing ongoing FBI and inspector-general probes, but confirmed that the possibility of a criminal conspiracy was under investigation. “The FBI is involved and they are looking at criminal enterprise, yes,” she said.</p>
      <p>Ms Hawk Sawyer defended Bureau of Prisons practice, and instead blamed a lack of resources for problems in the bureau. “Policies are sound, staff don’t always follow them because they were stretched too thin,” she said.</p>

      <p>Epstein had been put on suicide watch after an apparent attempt to take his life on July 23, a few weeks after his arrest. He was moved back to the special housing unit, an area of the prison separate from the general inmate population, on July 30. His cell was the nearest one to the guards’ common area.</p>
      <p>According to Bureau of Prison policy, Epstein should have been checked every 30 minutes as part of an inspection of the special housing unit. In addition, correctional officers are required to do five general checks of the entire prison population each day.</p>
      <p>Ms Noel, Mr Thomas and other prison guards failed to conduct any of those checks in the lead-up to Epstein’s suicide, prosecutors claimed.</p>
      <p>Ms Noel had worked at the MCC since 2016, while Mr Thomas, a materials handler supervisor, had also worked as a correctional officer since 2007. Both were working overtime shifts on the night of Epstein’s death.</p>
      <p>The indictment said that Epstein’s cellmate had been transferred out of the MCC “in a routine, pre-arranged transfer” at 8am on August 9, but despite orders from the jail’s psychological cell, no new cellmate was assigned.</p>
      <p>At 10:30pm that evening, Ms Noel “briefly walked up to” the door to the floor where Epstein was housed, which was the last time anyone approached, “let alone entered”, the area until the following morning, prosecutors claimed.</p>
      <p>“No one conducted any counts or rounds throughout the night, and no one entered the area in which Epstein was housed,” the indictment said.</p>

      <p>Prosecutors claimed that during the night, Ms Noel and Mr Thomas had for two hours “sat at their desk without moving, and appeared to have been asleep”.</p>
      <p>Throughout the night, both remained inside the guards’ common area in the special housing unit, using the computer at times, according to prosecutors. Ms Noel searched the internet for “furniture sales and benefit websites” and Mr Thomas for “motorcycle sales and sports news”, the indictment alleged.</p>
