      <h1>Spotify Announces New ‘Your Daily Podcasts’ Algorithmic Playlist</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T17:25:24+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 17:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.macstories.net/author/johnvoorhees/" target="_blank">John Voorhees</a></address>
      <p>Spotify aims to do for podcasts what it’s done for music recommendations with today’s announcement of <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2019-11-19/your-daily-podcasts-playlist-makes-finding-your-next-favorite-show-easier-than-ever/">a new algorithmic podcast playlist</a>.</p>
      <p>One of the music streaming service’s greatest strengths is the analysis it does of users’ listening habits, which it uses to recommend new tracks through playlists like Discover Weekly and Daily Mix. <a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2019-11-19/your-daily-podcasts-playlist-makes-finding-your-next-favorite-show-easier-than-ever/">According to Spotify</a>, its new ‘Your Daily Podcasts’ playlist will analyze recent episodes you’ve streamed and the shows you follow to make recommendations tailored to the type of shows that match your interests. For example, for story-based sequential shows that you haven’t tried before, Spotify will offer the trailer or first episode of a show, while for daily, news-based podcasts, the playlist may include a recent, topical episode.</p>
      <p>The addition of ‘Your Daily Podcasts’ is not surprising given <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/spotify-acquires-podcast-producer-gimlet-media-and-app-maker-anchor/">remarks by Spotify CEO Daniel Ek</a> when the company acquired Gimlet Media and Anchor. At the time, Ek said Spotify would offer improved ‘curation and customization’ for users and ‘better discovery, data, and monetization to creators.’</p>
      <p>Podcast discovery remains an area that a number of companies are working to improve. As Spotify’s share of the podcast listener market increases, its ability to anticipate the podcasts and individual episodes that subscribers will enjoy has the potential to rival what has already made it such an attractive service for many music fans. Given its dominance of podcasting, it will also be interesting to see if Apple counters by enhancing its own discovery tools in the future.</p>
      <p>Spotify says that the new playlist is available to subscribers in the US, UK, Germany, Sweden, Mexico, Brazil, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand who have listened to at least four podcasts in the past 90 days.</p>
