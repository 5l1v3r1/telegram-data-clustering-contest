      <p>A judge has slammed police for letting a male officer quiz a teenage rape victim about her ordeal for more than two hours, saying it was ‘little short of further abuse’.</p>
      <p>Joseph McDonagh, 31, was jailed for 16 years and given an extended sentence after being declared dangerous by a judge.</p>
      <p>However, judge Hilary Manley also hit out at police, saying it was ‘incomprehensible’ the girl was ‘expected to recount, in intimate detail and over a period of close to two-and-a-half hours, the details, to a male police officer’.</p>
      <p>The judge added: ‘It was little short of a further abuse of her, and she made it clear at trial in her evidence that she had found the experience unbearably uncomfortable.’</p>
      <p>‘Violent and manipulative bully’ McDonagh, told his victim that his vile act was ‘sex education’, Manchester Crown court heard.</p>

      <p>McDonagh, from Cheetham Hill, Manchester, assaulted his victim after having taken cocaine and alcohol, calling her a ‘slag’ and threatening her with further violence unless she complied with his demands.</p>

      <p>Judge Manley said: ‘You told her that what you were doing to was “sex education”.</p>
      <p>The judge added: ‘The emotional scars will take much longer to heal. She described that she felt as though you treated her like a “thing”, an object.’</p>
      <p>She also criticised the fact the girl had to wait more than two years for justice to be served, which  represented a ‘sad decline in the ability of the criminal justice system to protect and serve victims’.</p>
      <p>The court also heard that the girl had been left ‘feeling sad most of the time’, and that she feels ‘guilty if she ever feels happy’.</p>
      <p>She also took an overdose following the attack, the court was told.</p>
      <p>McDonagh was handed an extended sentence after the judge said he was a ‘dangerous’ offender.</p>
      <p>He must serve two-thirds of his 16-year jail term, and will then remain on licence for a further eight years.</p>
      <p>Before sending him down, Judge Manley told McDonagh: ‘The reason you are in this dock, and being sentenced, is due to your actions alone.</p>
      <p>‘It is not the responsibility of your victim. You did what you did, and you must be punished for it. She is not responsible. She is still a child.’</p>

      <p>Paying tribute to the victim, the judge said she has ‘displayed courage and maturity above and beyond that displayed by some of the adults around her’.</p>
      <p>The judge added: ‘It is to be hoped that, should she be able to come to terms with what was done to her, and should she be provided with adequate support and understanding, she will be able to utilise the resources and character that she possesses, to have a bright future.’</p>
