      <h2>Visakhapatnam police introduce the first lady robocop in the State</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T17:49:06+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 17:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Harish-Gilai-25437/" target="_blank">Harish Gilai</a></address>
      <p>A new chapter unfolds in the citizen-friendly approach of the Andhra Pradesh police. Cybira (Cyber interactive robotic agent), the first lady robocop in the State, has received its first complaint from a woman of the Dabagardens area in Visakhapatnam.</p>
      <p>Ms. Cybira is the new initiative by the police in association with a group of techies to help citizens file complaints hassle free. The name, look and feel of the robot is designed so as to encourage people, especially women, to lodge complaints without any apprehension. Cybira is new face of the police, who would listen to people, take their complaints and register them systematically.</p>
      <p>Designed by start-up Robo Coupler, the pilot project Cybira is capable of receiving complaints in both digital and manual forms from the public. The pilot ‘robo cop’ stationed at Maharanipeta police station, is drawing attention of all. Locals nearby are coming to the station to see it and calling it as 'Chitti’ (The name of the robo in the Rajnikanth movie ‘The Robo’)</p>
      <p>In the digital form, the victim/petitioner will just enter his details and type of complaint in the tab which is integrated in the robot. In case any victim is unaware of usage of tabs or electronic devices, he would just speak before Cybira.</p>
      <p>“Ms. Cybira will ask the petitioners a couple of questions and register complaint in both forms. Once the complaint is registered, it would be sent to officials in control room who would validate whether it is original or fake. Then the complaint will be forwarded to the police official concerned,” said CEO of Robo Coupler, Praveen Malla, explaining the functioning of Ms. Cybira to <i>The Hindu.</i></p>
      <p>According to Mr. Praveen, they have designed Cybira in such a way that if the complaint is not resolved within 24 hours, it would send an alert to the officer and also extend the time by another 24 hours. If the complaint is not resolved within 48 hours, an alert would be sent to higher official as per programmed hierarchy, he said.</p>
      <h3>Fully equipped</h3>
      <p>Ms. Cybira is equipped with 360 degree high resolution camera, a tab, 180 GB internal hard disk, Internet of Things (IoT) chip, micro-controller or micro processor. It can salute the officials and through its wheels, it can also move from one place to another. Cybira can interact in English and Telugu languages as of now. A 40-minute charge can make it work for about 24 hours, team members of Robo Coupler, Brijesh Babu, I. Aditya Hemanth Kumar and G. Minna Rao said. The team members also said that Cybira can be handled through voice recognition, mobile phones and also manually.</p>
      <h3>Pilot project</h3>
      <p>According to Commissioner of Police R.K Meena, the pilot project will be used in various police stations in Visakhapatnam and its functioning will be observed for a month. On the coming Monday, Ms. Cybira will be used in ‘Spandana' programme.</p>
      <p>Mr. Praveen also said that the police officials have sought some changes to Cybira and they feel that basing on the success, the robot should be placed in railway stations, beach road and a few other public places to make sure public can easily access it.</p>
