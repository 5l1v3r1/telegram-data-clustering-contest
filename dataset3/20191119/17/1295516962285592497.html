      <p>With <i><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/star-wars-episode-ix/">Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</a></i>'s theatrical release inching ever-closer, new <a href="https://www.cbr.com/star-wars-rise-of-skywalker-dolby-cinema-exclusive-poster/">posters</a>, <a href="https://www.cbr.com/star-wars-rise-of-skywalker-new-images/">photos,</a> <a href="https://www.cbr.com/star-wars-rise-of-skywalker-new-footage/">footage</a> -- and some new insight -- have made their way to the forefront.</p>
      <p>While speaking with <i><a href="https://ew.com/movies/2019/11/19/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker/">EW</a></i>, director J.J. Abrams revealed that sequel trilogy protagonist Rey will likely rely on her practical instincts to win the day as opposed to her honed Force powers. "The scavenger who is desperate and haggling for portions and trying to survive [in <i>The</i> <i>Force Awakens</i>] — those special skills and that special experience ends up being something that is essential to saving the galaxy," he said.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.cbr.com/star-wars-rise-of-skywalker-rey-parents/">Rey's rather ordinary lineage</a> was revealed in <i>The Last Jedi</i>. Despite having an intrinsic connection to the Force, much of her identity is based on her time spent in isolation on Jakku. As a scavenger, she lived in poverty, scrounging for paltry meals. Only time will tell how Rey's somber origin factors into the new film.</p>

Abrams, <i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker </i>stars Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, Lupita Nyong’o, Domhnall Gleeson, Kelly Marie Tran, Joonas Suotamo, Billie Lourd, Keri Russell, Anthony Daniels, Mark Hamill, Billy Dee Williams and Carrie Fisher, with Naomi Ackie and Richard E. Grant. The film arrives Dec. 20.</p>
