      <p>New Delhi: India on Tuesday appealed against a <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/World-Trade-Organization">World Trade Organization</a> (WTO) dispute settlement panel's ruling that had recommended withdrawal of its key export subsidy schemes, including the one for special economic zones in the next 90-180 days.</p>
      <p>India filed an appeal before the organisation’s <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Appellate-Body">Appellate Body</a> on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>On October 31, the WTO had ruled that export subsidy programmes-Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS), Export Oriented Units Scheme and sector specific schemes, including Electronics Hardware Technology Parks Scheme and Bio-Technology Parks Scheme; Export Promotion Capital Goods Scheme; and Duty-Free Imports for Exporters Scheme- violated provisions of the trade body’s norms.</p>
      <p>Appeals cannot re-open factual findings made by the panel but when a decision is challenged by an appeal by the member-country concerned, it cannot come into effect.</p>
      <p>Each appeal is heard by three members of an Appellate Body comprising persons of recognised authority and unaffiliated with any government. Generally, the Appellate Body has up to three months to conclude its report.</p>
      <p>However, the body is likely to become dysfunctional from December 11, when the number of judges on the panel would fall below the minimum threshold.</p>
