      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T17:04:11+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 17:04</time> by <a rel="author">Ian Jones</a></address>
      <p>The constituency of Stirling is the SNP's top target in December's <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/general-election-2019-everything-you-20880939">UK election.</a></p>
      <p>Conservative candidate <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/stirling-mp-stephen-kerr-claimed-15009915">Stephen Kerr</a> is defending a majority of just 148.</p>
      <p>A swing to the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-national-party">SNP</a> of only 0.2% would see the seat change hands.</p>
      <p>The SNP have brought in a heavyweight candidate in the shape of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/local-news/mep-alyn-smith-confirmed-snp-20396357">Alyn Smith</a> who is presently a high-profile MEP.</p>
      <p>It is one of the most marginal constituencies in Scotland - and one of a number of seats the SNP are determined to take from the Conservatives, having lost them at the 2017 election.</p>
      <h3>Stirling 2017</h3>
      <p>Stephen Kerr won the seat in 2017 on a swing to the Tories of 11.4%.</p>
      <p>The result was so close that a recount was necessary.</p>
      <p>This time the SNP will be hoping for the sort of swing that will see them take Stirling easily, along with the likes of Gordon (2.5%), Angus (3.3%) and Moray (4.4%).</p>
      <p>For the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/conservative-party">Conservatives</a> , holding seats like Stirling will be a vital test of the party's popularity in Scotland.</p>
      <p>It would also help to offset potential losses elsewhere in the country.</p>
      <p>Labour held Stirling continuously from 1997 to 2015, but finished third in 2017.</p>
      <h3>Stirling result 2015</h3>
      <p>The party isn't really in contention this time, as Stirling is now very much a two-horse race.</p>
      <p>Along with the SNP, Conservatives and Labour, the Liberal Democrats and Greens are also standing in the seat.</p>
      <p>Stirling voted 67.7% Remain in the EU referendum - the fourth highest Remain vote in Scotland, and the 20th highest Remain vote in the UK.</p>
      <p>The candidates standing in Stirling are: Stephen Kerr, Conservative; Bryan Quinn, Greens; Fayzan Rehman, Liberal Democrats; Mary-Kate Ross, Labour; Alyn Smith, SNP.</p>
