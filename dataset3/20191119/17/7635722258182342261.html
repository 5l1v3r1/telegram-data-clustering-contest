        <b>The Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has stood by his under fire by-election candidate, amid calls for her to be removed from the ticket.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Wexford by-election candidate Verona Murphy has apologised for comments about asylum seekers after saying ISIS has already manipulated children as young as four.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.newstalk.com/news/poor-choice-words-fg-candidate-apologises-comments-asylum-seekers-926193">She has apologised</a> </b>for comments she made about asylum seekers needing to be de-programmed.</p>
      <p>That is not an apology TD Brid Smith accepted when questioning Mr Varadkar in the Dáil.</p>
      <p>She said: "When will you de-programme this candidate and de-select her?</p>
      <p>"Because if you don't, the use of the race card and the increased use of it is on your shoulders".</p>
      <p>Mr Varadkar condemned the comments, but stood by Ms Murphy saying: "It's certainly not something that is tolerated in the party that I lead".</p>
      <p>Earlier Mr Varadkar said he will be campaigning with her: "Verona's a very out-spoken , very independent person - she's not going to be the kind of person who tows the party line.</p>
      <p>"I think on some occasions she's got it absolutely wrong.</p>
      <blockquote>"But she is the selected candidate and I will certainly be campaigning with her before polling day and I have done since."</blockquote>
      <p>"I spoke to her about them yesterday: they were misinformed, they were ill-advised, they were wrong and she was right to apologise for them".</p>
      <p>Local opposition TDs in Wexford, James Brown and Brendan Howlin, were less forgiving.</p>
      <p>Mr Brown said: "I would absolutely condemn her comments - they're totally unacceptable, they're totally outrageous".</p>
      <p>And Mr Howlin added: "It's profoundly ignorant, and it's profoundly wrong".</p>
      <p>While Social Democrat Roisin Shortall said the Justice Minister Charlie Flanagan has questions to answer for bringing Ms Murphy to a refugee reception centre in Waterford.</p>
      <p>She said: "You'd wonder how that was ordered so quickly - I think it was a very cynical move, and I think the minister has probably over-stepped the mark".</p>
      <p>Ms Murphy has also been criticised for saying bad personal choices have led to people becoming homeless.</p>
      <p>The Immigrant Council of Ireland has described the situation around Ms Murphy's remarks on asylum seekers as "outrageous".</p>
      <p>Following her initial apology on Sunday night, Fine Gael said Ms Murphy visited a centre in Waterford to "gain a better understanding of asylum and refugee issues".</p>
      <p>The businesswoman said she now realised that she "had a poor understanding of asylum issues and I apologise wholeheartedly for my remarks".</p>
      <p>She stated: “I was very moved by my visit. I met men, women and children from war torn regions who came here to escape brutal violence so that they could live normal family lives.</p>
      <blockquote>"Their stories were harrowing and have had a profound impact on my understanding of the issue."</blockquote>
      <p>Justice Minister Charlie Flanagan, meanwhile, said the candidate's initial comments were "based on false rumours and misinformation" and that she's now apologised.</p>
      <p>He added: "I believe that public representatives and those running for election must step up and confront fabrications.”</p>
      <p>Speaking on <i>Newstalk Breakfast</i> earlier, Teresa Buxzkowska - the Immigrant Council's Integration Coordinator - accused Ms Murphy of using "stigmatising and dehumanising language" in her initial comments.</p>
      <p>She argued: "The apology and the whole situation is very, very outrageous.</p>
      <p>"She was given access to a group of people that she stigmatised in the first place [by] making ungrounded statements without any factual evidence.</p>
      <blockquote>"They are not exhibitions or tools for education... they are people."</blockquote>
      <p>Ms Buxzkowska suggested that Ms Murphy's original words will "always be in the public domain", and there's a need for everyone to be careful about the words they use.</p>
