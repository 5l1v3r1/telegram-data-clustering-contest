      <p>We All Fall Down is the last piece of DLC, following on from They Came From Below and Lightbearer. It's set after Act Three of We Happy Few, and after Victoria Byng's confrontation with Ollie. Victoria Byng, daughter of Robert Byng, was a major antagonist of the main game. This DLC focuses on her and her withdrawal from Joy. Now off the drug, she can see exactly what's happened to Wellington Wells. Victoria was always driven by her duty, and the city always came first. Now that she's clear-headed and can see the state the city's really in, her duty is the same — to put the city first. We All Fall Down follows her efforts to rectify all the wrongs of Wellington Wells. It's more story-based, and so doesn't have the survival mechanics of the base game. The description says that "there's no time for eating, sleeping, and crafting while the world falls apart", so perhaps this removal of the survival mechanics is meant to ramp up the urgency and make the story that much more immersive. Victoria's main weapon is her whip, but she also has a dart gun for a more stealthy approach. The DLC also brings changes to exploration, as Victoria can travel across the roofs.</p>

I've just finished studying a Masters in English Literature, but I've been obsessed with gaming since long before then. I began on the PS2 with Spyro, before graduating to the Xbox 360 and disappearing into Skyrim. I'm now a loyal RPG fan, but I still like to explore other genres — when I'm not playing Assassin's Creed Odyssey, or being lured back into Red Dead Redemption 2 or The Witcher 3!</p>
