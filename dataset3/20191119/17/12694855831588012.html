It’s an important occasion, and our guide reveals everything you need to know to watch the Johnson vs Corbyn debate on TV and online, wherever you are.</b>

      <p>Worried that you might not be able to access ITV Hub where you are? A common workaround is to use a VPN – and our guide to the <b><a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/best/best-vpn-3470328">best VPNs</a></b> is the obvious place to get started choosing the one that’s right for you.</p>

      <h3>Which other TV debates are planned?</h3>
      <p>If you switch back to ITV 1 at 10pm, you’ll also be able to watch The ITV Election Interviews, which is described as “a live interview based programme in which other party leaders will be able to comment on the head-to-head debate and set out their own electoral offers”.</p>
      <p>Nina Hossain will be interrogating Jo Swinson of the Liberal Democrats, Nicola Sturgeon of the SNP, Nigel Farage of the Brexit Party, and Sian Berry, the co-leader of the Green Party.</p>
      <p>ITV has another televised debate, this time involving the Conservatives, Labour, Liberal Democrats, SNP, Green Party, Plaid Cymru and the Brexit Party all at the same time, scheduled for December 1.</p>
      <p>The BBC, meanwhile, will televise its own Johnson vs Corbyn debate on December 6, and a separate seven-way debate on November 29.</p>
