      <h1>Stadia launches today</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T17:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 17:00</time> by <a rel="author">Phil Harrison</a></address>
      <p>There is a moment in every gamer’s life when they experience something unforgettable.  Whether it’s the time they first beat the final boss in their favorite game, were mesmerized by the unfolding story in a brand-new franchise, or watched an up-and-coming YouTube streamer entertain them with a game they’ve never even heard of… those moments are magical.  </p>
      <p>We’re now on the cusp of a similarly memorable moment. Starting today, playing games on your TV in 4K without a console, streaming games to a Chrome browser on a simple laptop, or enjoying the biggest games ever made on your phone is a reality. It seems impossible until you experience it. Stadia Founder’s Edition starts arriving today, making the world’s best games available to players everywhere without a dedicated console or expensive PC.</p>

      <p>The barriers between you and the games you love are coming down: it’s just your games and your screens with nothing but electric air in between. Thank you for being a part of the Stadia community. See you in the game.</p>
