      <h1>Good news! TfL is freezing travel fares for the fourth year in a row</h1>

      <p>You don’t need us to tell you that living in London is expensive. Just take a look at your banking app. See? Ouch. Told you.</p>
      <p>But while we’re all prone to moaning about the increasing price of a pint (a fiver! An outrage!) and lamenting how much of our wages we spent on that just-missed-the-last-train Uber, we’re also all for celebrating an easy win. Which is what we’ve been given by TfL, who, for the fourth year in a row, has announced that it’ll be freezing fares for pay-as-you-go travel.</p>
      <p>That means bus fares will remain priced at £1.50 and off-peak tube journeys between Zones 2 and 6 will stay at their 2016 rates. Nice one, Sadiq.</p>
      <p>Admittedly it’s not ALL good news: travel cards will go up by 2.8 percent in 2020 (that’s around a £40 increase for a yearly Zone 1 and 2 ticket). But for those taking each day as it comes, you’re in luck.</p>
      <p>Because, yes, progress is good. But when it comes to spending rates, we’re all for slowing the forward-motion down…</p>
      <p>
        <b>Why not celebrate by hopping on the tube and exploring <a href="https://www.timeout.com/london/things-to-do/the-cultural-tfl-map">London’s cultural TfL map</a> – a guide to all the cool goings-on near each station.</b>
