      <h2>It's all ending in heartbreak on Serbian reality TV show 'Parovi' as 21-year-old Milijana Bozic pushes her 74-year-old hubby Milojko Bozic to breaking point with her antics</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T17:53:06+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 17:53</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Wilkes, Ana Marjanovic, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>A 74-year-old has decided to divorce his 21-year-old wife after she was caught kissing and showering with another OAP in the same house as her husband.</p>
      <p>Serbian reality TV show 'Parovi' - which translates as 'Couples' in English - sees <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/woman-21-who-married-man-20810573">Milijana Bozic, 21, live in a house with husband Milojko Bozic</a> , who she wed in September this year.</p>
      <p>But cameras caught Milijana kissing 60-year-old Nemanja Stamatovic Zabac</p>
      <p>During the show, the 21-year-old reportedly entered the shower with her latest lover and was caught by her husband.</p>
      <p>And local media reports Milijana is under pressure from Mr Zabac to give him €50,000 EUR (£42,739) if she takes half of her husband's money in the divorce.</p>

      <p>Mr Bozic reportedly reacted angrily and told her she can shower with whoever she wants because he does not care anymore.</p>
      <p>He was reportedly taken out of the house over health concerns after he caught his wife with the other man.</p>
      <p>And he was said to have asked for a lawyer to start divorce proceedings against his wife.</p>
      <p>A producer from the show told reporters: "He had a hard time having to divorce Miljana, which is why as a production team we had to react.</p>

      <p>"We took him out of the villa during the day and took him to a hospital.</p>
      <p>"He was immediately given medical help, and it was revealed that he was under high pressure due to the stress he had experienced on the reality show."</p>
      <p>Husband Mr Bozic is said to be confiding in his new friend Aleksandra Jaksic on the show, and she asked him if the couple had agreed to be faithful in their marriage.</p>
      <p>He said: "You know how old I am! We didn't have a deal. I was looking for a lawyer to have a nice divorce."</p>
      <p>He has reportedly asked for the lawyer to be brought into the house so the divorce can be filed.</p>
