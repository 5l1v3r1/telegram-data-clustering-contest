      <p>Nov. 19 (UPI) -- A United Arab Emirates family said they spent 153 days attempting a Guinness World Record for the world's largest handwritten Bible.</p>
      <p>Manoj Varghese, his wife, Susan, and their children, Karun and Krupa, took turns copying the entire holy book onto A1-sized paper and Varghese said it took a total of about 153 days to finish the more than 1,500-page tome.</p>
      <p>"I would spend 12 to 15 hours every day meticulously writing out the Bible. My eyes would twitch and my hands would hurt, but in the process I found the Bible speaking to me, inspiring and guiding me," Susan Varghese, who handled 66 books of the Bible herself, <a href="https://gulfnews.com/uae/watch-dubai-based-indian-family-attempts-writing-largest-bible-1.67930176">told Gulf News.</a></p>
      <p>The family said the book was examined by a surveyor and a graphologist as part of the requirements set forth by Guinness. The family also took video record of the writing process for the record-keeping group.</p>
      <p>The completed Bible is set to go on display at the Mar Thoma Church in Jebel Ali.</p>
      <p>An Indian man, Sunil Joseph,<a href="https://www.worldrecordacademy.com/biggest/biggest_hand_written_Bible_world_record_set_by_Sunil_Joseph_80171.htm"> previously attempted the record</a> for the world's largest handwritten Bible in 2005. Joseph's Bible weighed in at 135 pounds and took him 123 days to write.</p>
