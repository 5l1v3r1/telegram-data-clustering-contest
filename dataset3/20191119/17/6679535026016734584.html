      <p>The serial high-value deposits made by Hoskote’s BJP nominee N. Nagaraju (MTB) after he switched sides resulting in the collapse of the JD(S)-Congress coalition government has come under attack by the Congress.</p>
      <p>“A large sum of money was deposited in the account of a disqualified MLA just after the BJP came to power via Operation Lotus,” KPCC president Dinesh Gundu Rao tweeted without mentioning Mr. Nagaraju’s name. “Several audio/videotapes of BJP leaders offering money to the MLAs to switch (sides) have been released. Shouldn’t these money transfers be probed? Why is the I-T/ED silent?” he tweeted.</p>
      <p>From July till October this year, Mr. Nagaraju, whose resignation and anti-party activities attracted disqualification, has deposited about ₹48 crore as fixed deposits at the SBI branch in Hoodi and Canara Bank branch in Mahadevpura. The details of his deposits have been mentioned in the affidavit that he filed during filing of nomination for Hoskote Assembly constituency.</p>
      <p>Incidentally, Mr. Nagaraju has ₹134.56 crore and his wife M. Shanthakumari has ₹32.4 crore in serial deposits which were made since 2018. An analysis by the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR) for the 2018 Assembly polls, when he had declared his total assets to be ₹1,015 crore, also had similar fixed deposits in the couple’s name.</p>
      <p>The former Congress legislator has declared his total assets to be around ₹1,195.79 crore in this election, an increase by ₹180 crore between May 2018 and October 2019, the highest growth shown by any disqualified legislator contesting now on BJP ticket. Also, the loan extended by his family has increased from ₹234 crore to ₹301 crore this election.</p>
      <p>Among other BJP candidates, Anand Singh, who filed his nomination from Vijayanagar, has declared his total assets to be around ₹220 crore while the family has lent about ₹45 crore. The family also owes about ₹75 crore. According to the ADR, he declared assets worth ₹117 crore and liability at ₹27 crore.</p>

His liabilities have increased marginally from ₹13 crore to ₹15.5 crore. K. Gopalaiah, who is contesting from Mahalakshmi Layout on BJP ticket after deserting the JD(S), has declared assets worth about ₹17.15 crore, up from ₹10 crore in 2018.</p>
      <p>BJP candidate from Chickballapur K. Sudhakar’s assets have marginally increased from about ₹15 crore to ₹17.55 crore and liabilities from about ₹10 crore to nearly ₹11 crore. Similarly, BJP candidate from Hirekerur B.C. Patil has declared ₹8.5 crore assets, a jump from ₹5.5 crore in 2018. Former JD(S) State president A.H. Vishwanath has assets worth ₹3.22 crore, a marginal increase from ₹3.07 crore. S.T.
