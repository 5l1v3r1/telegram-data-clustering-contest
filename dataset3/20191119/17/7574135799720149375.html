      <p>Emo-proggers <b>Coheed &amp; Cambria</b> are throwing their own cruise festival next year. The <a href="https://www.ssneverender.com/">S.S. Neverender</a> sets sail from Miami, FL to Nassau, Bahamas from October 26 through October 30, 2020, with <b>Taking Back Sunday, The Dear Hunter, Polyphia, Thank You Scientist, Culture Abuse, Torche, Three,</b> Coheed side projects <b>Fire Deuce</b> and <b>Weerd Science,</b> the <b>Emo Nite</b> DJs, and more to be announced. Coheed are promising two unique sets featuring “never-before and never-again performances,” deep cuts, and early material, as well as “interactive experiences” from Claudio Sanchez’s comic series <i>The Amory Wars</i>, games, cosplay, and other activities.</p>
      <p>“We’re always trying to find ways to improve the fan experience,” Coheed founding member Travis Stever says. “Our fans like to travel, they like to meet other fans, we’re like a big family. So the idea of a cruise seemed like a way to allow a bunch of us to just go on vacation together.”</p>
