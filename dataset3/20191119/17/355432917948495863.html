      <h1>Chris Wallace: Trump testifying 'would be akin to Prince Andrew testifying about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T17:11:38+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 17:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/joe-concha" target="_blank">Joe Concha</a></address>
      <p>"Fox News Sunday" anchor <a href="https://thehill.com/people/christopher-chris-wallace">Chris Wallace</a> predicted <a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a> testifying in impeachment hearings on Capitol Hill "would be akin to Prince Andrew testifying about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein" during commentary on "America's Newsroom" on Tuesday.<br/><br/>"This question of President Trump, and he did lay out the possibility that he was going to testify, I would think that that would be akin to Prince Andrew testifying about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, which one British critic said was like an airplane crashing into an oil tanker causing a tsunami that set off a nuclear explosion," deadpanned Wallace.</p>
      <p>"It’s an entertaining thing and it’s certainly got us all talking but my guess is it’s not going to happen and if it did it would be a very controversial and perhaps unwise policy by the president," the veteran newsman added.<br/><br/>Trump tweeted on Monday that he will "strongly consider" providing written or in-person testimony in the House impeachment inquiry.  The president was responding to Speaker <a href="https://thehill.com/people/nancy-pelosi">Nancy Pelosi</a>'s (D-Calif.) comments on CBS's "Face the Nation" on Sunday in which she invited Trump to "come right before the committee and talk ... or he could do it in writing."<br/><br/>"Even though I did nothing wrong, and don’t like giving credibility to this No Due Process Hoax, I like the idea &amp; will, in order to get Congress focused again, strongly consider it!" Trump tweeted.</p>

      <p>This isn't the first time Wallace has spoken out on the impeachment inquiry, and Trump has attacked him for his comments.</p>
      <p>On Friday he said that if viewers weren't moved by the impeachment testimony of former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine <a href="https://thehill.com/people/marie-yovanovitch">Marie Yovanovitch</a>, they <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/media/470655-chris-wallace-on-yovanovitch-testimony-if-youre-not-moved-you-dont-have-a">"don't have a pulse,"</a> during commentary on "America's Newsroom."   </p>
      <p>On Sunday <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/media/470851-trump-rips-nasty-and-obnoxious-chris-wallace-after-he-presses-scalise-about">Trump attacked Wallace</a> over his earlier interview with House Minority Whip <a href="https://thehill.com/people/steve-scalise">Steve Scalise</a> (R-La.). He called Wallace "nasty &amp; obnoxious" on Twitter.</p>
