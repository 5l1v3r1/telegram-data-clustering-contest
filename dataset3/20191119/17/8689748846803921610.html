      <p>Rumors had it that the “mother- daughter”  relationship between the two turned sour  mainly because Tracey also owns a pub and restaurant in Kumasi.</p>
      <p>Reacting to this in an interview with Zionfelix  on the “uncut” show, Tracey said there was no iota of truth to the rumor.</p>
      <p>Tracey Boakye explained that  competition in business is very common and she will never soil her great relationship with the woman she calls mother for such flimsy reasons.</p>
      <p>She tasked her fans to forget about the rumor as there is no truth to it.</p>
