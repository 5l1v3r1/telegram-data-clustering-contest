      <p>ROCKLIN, Calif. (KOVR/CNN) - One couple appears willing to go further than most to get their hands on ice cream.</p>
      <p>A realtor said the two faked interest in a house for sale to gain access to the freezer, and other realtors don’t think it’s the first time they’ve done something like this.</p>
      <p>A picture may say a thousand words, but this one has sparked a thousand questions.</p>
      <p>Elizabeth Axelgard says her clients noticed something was off after an open house on Saturday, so they checked their security cameras.</p>
      <p>"It showed this couple walking into the garage, opening several cabinets and then the female opening the refrigerator door, taking out something, putting it in her large handbag,” Axelgard said.</p>
      <p>Luckily, it wasn't anything too valuable.</p>
      <p>"Well, when I found out what it was, I was really shocked. I was like, ‘Seriously? You're taking ice cream?’” Axelgard said.</p>
      <p>Others in the industry said this wasn’t the first time the couple stole something at an open house.</p>
      <p>"When I shared it on social media, a lot of agents reached out to me and said that they recognize the couple,” Axelgard said.</p>
      <p>"There have been two instances that I know that happened in addition to the one that happened this weekend,” another realtor, Joanie Cubias, said.</p>
      <p>Cubias said she and her colleague had candlesticks and pain medication taken from their open houses last year.</p>
      <p>She said her clients didn't have cameras like these to catch the suspected thieves in the act.</p>
      <p>Although, Cubias says her client's doorbell camera captured a couple walking into an open house in August, and the pair looks pretty familiar.</p>
      <p>"Just the coincidence that these two people were at, were visitors at these open houses and things went missing,” Cubias said.</p>
      <p>The homeowners say they don't plan to file a police report for the stolen ice cream.</p>
