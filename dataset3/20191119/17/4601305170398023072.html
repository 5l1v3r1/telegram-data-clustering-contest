      <h1>The State of South Dakota wants you to know that it's on meth</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T17:18:09+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 17:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://boingboing.net/author/cory_doctorow_1" target="_blank">Cory Doctorow</a></address>
      <p>South Dakota Republican Governor Kristi L. Noem spent $449,000 (more that $0.50 per resident of South Dakota!) on a campaign to educate state residents about the state's program to address its methamphetamine epidemic. That campaign's slogan? "Meth: I'm On It."</p>
      <p>The slogan has been widely mocked. Noem insists that this is all part of a cunning plan because "any publicity is good publicity."</p>
      <blockquote>Appearing to respond to the backlash in a Sunday evening tweet, Noem bought into the adage that any publicity is good publicity. She suggested the campaign was successful because so many people were talking about it. <br/><br/>In a separate statement emailed to The Washington Post, she called the anti-meth initiative “a bold, innovative effort like the nation has never before seen.” <br/><br/>“South Dakota’s anti-meth campaign launch is sparking conversations around the state and the country,” she said. “The mission of the campaign is to raise awareness — to get people talking about how they can be part of the solution and not just the problem. It is working.”</blockquote>
