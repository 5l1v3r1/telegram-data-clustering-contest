        <i>In an extract from his new book, Ashley Mallett recalls a telling incident on a tour to apartheid era South Africa</i>
      </p>
      <p>The year was 1976. Australia had just beaten Clive Lloyd’s West Indians 5–1 on home soil. In March of that year <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/richie-benaud">Richie Benaud</a> was the manager of the International Wanderers tour of South Africa. Benaud had brought the team to the republic to help South Africa’s non-white cricketers and to help break down barriers. In accordance with Benaud’s stipulation the team included a number of non-white cricketers – Tiffie Barnes, Winston Carelse, Baboo Ebrahim, Devdas Govindjee, David Jacobs and Farouk Timol.</p>
      <p>We won the first match in Cape Town, drew the second in Johannesburg and lost the final match in Durban, thanks to an inspirational bowling performance by the left-arm spinner Ebrahim.</p>
      <p>The Australians on the tour had become acquainted with Ebrahim six years earlier, when he had turned up to the Australian team’s training and asked if he could bowl to Lawry’s men. Ian Redpath, who was Lawry’s opening partner, told the young Ebrahim that he could. A burly white security guard thought otherwise. “He can’t bowl to your men. That man is black.” Ebrahim did bowl to the Australians – and immediately impressed. He was better than the two spinners South Africa played in that Test match, off spinner Michael Seymour and left-armer Grahame Chevalier.</p>
      <p>Ebrahim’s performance in the third unofficial Test in Durban in 1976 warmed the hearts of all, even the Wanderers. He took six second-innings wickets to humble our side.</p>
      <p>One teammate was the jovial West Indian and Kent all-rounder John Shepherd. He particularly agonised over Ebrahim. Here was a brilliantly gifted spinner denied the chance to play for his country in an official Test match because of the colour of his skin. For the duration of our short tour, Benaud insisted there be no restrictions on where people, regardless of colour, could stand or sit to watch a game. He also stipulated that bars in all parts of the ground be open to people of all races and colours. By contrast, in 1970 when the Australian team had played its first provincial match of the tour in Pretoria, no non-white person was permitted to enter the ground.</p>
      <p>In Johannesburg Benaud had booked the team into a restaurant for a meal. Everyone was neatly, albeit casually, dressed: slacks, open-necked shirt and sports coat. The restaurant manager approached a table and began an extraordinary tirade where Shepherd was sitting.</p>
      <p>“Get out,” he yelled at Shep. “No tie, no service. You are not welcome here. Leave the premises immediately.”</p>
      <p>Incensed, Benaud confronted the restaurant manager. “Don’t concern yourself. We are all leaving and we plan to eat at a civilised establishment.”</p>
      <p>Whether the tour achieved any lasting good for the non-whites of the republic is debatable. Apartheid was a such a dreadful, heartless policy that only a concerted effort by many within and without the country could ever overturn minority rule. Eventually protests over many years, trade sanctions, isolation and international sporting ostracism prevailed.</p>
      <p>However, the International Wanderers tour demonstrated to the masses – black and white – through Ebrahim’s bowling in Durban, that a black South African was as good as and, in Ebrahim’s case, better than, a white man in the game of cricket. They knew that already, of course.</p>
      <p>Benaud influenced cricket and cricketers after the second world war more than any other person, including Don Bradman. Young cricketers, emerging journalists, would-be commentators – he had them all in the palm of his hand. Just like the flipper he bowled so handsomely, after Bruce Dooland showed him how to bowl it, after its creator Clarrie Grimmett had shown him – which would in turn be bowled soon enough by one Shane Keith Warne.</p>

      <p>The eminent lyricist and writer – and my good friend – Sir Tim Rice, over a glass of wine in Tasmania, once asked Benaud if he would consider becoming MCC president at cricket headquarters, Lord’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/cricket">Cricket</a> Ground. Richie politely declined.</p>
      <p>I wanted him to know that the Marylebone club, a conservative pillar of the England cricket Establishment, which curiously I was representing in 2002–03, could have imagined no greater honour than having Benaud – an Australian hero whose progressive views on the game both on and off the field for so many years had been so instrumental in dragging the game into each successive era – at its helm.</p>
      <p>Richie Benaud brought his special magic to the game of cricket.</p>
