      <p>Following the release of the <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/lil-peep-everybodys-everything-album-stream"><i>Everybody’s Everything</i> project</a> and<a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/9/everybodys-everything-lil-peep-documentary-official-trailer"> documentary of the same name</a>, a new music video for <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/lil-peep">Lil Peep</a>‘s “Keep My Coo” has surfaced. The video above showcases grainy home camera footage of Lil Peep back in his teen years, smoking, drinking, and playing with his cat.</p>
      <p>The footage opens with a clip of the rapper’s high school friend at a convenience store before they begin to inter-cut with Peep around his house. Billed as a “lovingly-curated collection of songs from Lil Peep’s career, including fan favorites that have never been available on all platforms, and songs that have never been released in any form,” <i>Everybody’s Everything</i> engineer BETTEROFFDEAD told <i><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/lil-peep-everybodys-everything-posthumous-album-912726/">Rolling Stone</a></i> he didn’t want to touch any original track. “The new stuff coming out, it hasn’t been changed,” he said. Songs like ‘Live Forever,’ those were all early songs that were just Peep. And these are the same thing; these are just purely Peep. It’s how these songs were before he left.”</p>
