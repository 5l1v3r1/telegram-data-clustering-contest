        <b>Audie Attar is optimistic he will be able to make an announcement over Conor McGregor’s comeback fight in the near future.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Conor McGregor’s manager hopes to confirm a deal for the Irishman to make his UFC comeback against Donald Cerrone “in the coming weeks”.</p>
      <p>The former two-weight world champion last month stated that he will make his return to the octagon on January 18.</p>
      <p>McGregor has not fought since he was beaten by Khabib Nurmagomedov in a lightweight title bout in October 2018.</p>
      <p>Cerrone urged the 31-year-old to “sign the deal” in October and Audie Attar, McGregor’s manager, is optimistic an agreement can soon be reached.</p>
      <p>He told the South China Morning Post: “I would say that talks have been progressing. We’ve met them [Cerrone’s team], we’re in close communication with them.</p>
      <p>“I would hope that an announcement could happen in the coming weeks, but at the end of the day, it’s still a work in progress.”</p>

      <p>Attar believes McGregor can be crowned UFC champion again.</p>
      <p>“I don’t see him slowing down,” he added.</p>
      <p>“I think that fighting once a year for the last couple of years, it’s almost like it’s grown his appetite to stay active.</p>
      <p>“In any sport, the more reps you take, the better you get. He’s no stranger to becoming a world champion multiple times over. He knows what it takes.”</p>
