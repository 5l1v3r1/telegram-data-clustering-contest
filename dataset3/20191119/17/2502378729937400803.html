      <h3>The seven-minute visual was created by 'Her Smell' director Alex Ross Perry</h3>
      <p>Soccer Mommy has just dropped a new single, "Yellow Is The Color Of Her Eyes," and gorgeous short film to accompany it. For the seven-minute video, created with <a href="https://nylon.com/her-smell-music-interview"><i>Her Smell</i> director Alex Ross Perry</a>, Soccer Mommy takes a stroll during golden hour, walking by the sea as she sings heartbreaking lyrics.</p>

      <p>"The challenge of creating a seven-minute piece was daunting and irresistible in equal measure," Perry shared in a press release. "Having just completed a film for which the color-coded design of its various acts was of the utmost importance, Sophie's idea of collaborating on a short form film to complement her similarly conceived new music was irresistible."</p>
      <p>Perry says that he "shared images from <i>Breaking the Waves </i>and <i>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</i>" to create a mood board of sorts before filming the video, adding, "It wasn't until we got the footage back that I realized a dash of first-scene-of-<i>Inception </i>had snuck in there, as well."</p>
