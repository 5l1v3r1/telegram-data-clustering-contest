      <p>Locals living in a village where people have found 13 bundles of £2,000 and handed them in said the first they knew about the mystery was when police announced it on social media.</p>
      <p>Gossip about the puzzling series of events in Blackhall Colliery, County Durham, had not spread beyond a few rumours about money being found.</p>
      <p>The village, made up of a long high street with rows of terraces off it, overlooking the North Sea, once had a thriving pit and has retained its sense of community, locals said.</p>

      <p>Until a post on Durham Police’s Facebook page on Monday, no-one appeared to know an anonymous donor had repeatedly dropped off bundles of 100 £20 notes in clear plastic cash bags, leaving them in communal areas such as in the local park, outside a church and behind shops.</p>
      <p>It has been happening since 2014 and the last time was on Monday, when detectives went public with their inquiry to find out who was behind the random generosity.</p>
      <p>Police have contacted the local bank and post office, and tried to trace the donor from fingerprints, so far without success.</p>
      <p>Detective Constable John Forster said: “We’ve even had the theory that it could be a lottery winner who has decided to pay something back to their local community, but the truth is we don’t know.</p>
      <p>“I hope that by going public with this that we get some answers, rather than whoever is behind this suddenly going quiet.</p>
      <p>“I really don’t think this is connected to criminality because people in that game are very careful with their money, they can account for every penny in my experience.”</p>

      <p>Gaynor Crute, chairwoman of Monk Hesleden Parish Council, which covers Blackhall Colliery, took pride in the fact that 13 times people have handed the cash over to police.</p>
      <p>Each time they can claim it if the rightful owner has not come forward.</p>
      <p>She said: “There’s so much negativity and bad press so when you have something like this it is obviously heart-warming to know the people you live with, your neighbours, have so much honesty and integrity.</p>
      <p>“It could be they’re in a situation where they could do with a nice windfall but they have still handed it in.”</p>
      <aside>It's so intriguing, all around the village people are talking about it<cite>Gaynor Crute</cite></aside>
      <p>She added: “Where has it come from? Is it a Good Samaritan, a well-wisher?</p>
      <p>“Then you think why Blackhall, what’s the link? Maybe it is someone who worked in the colliery.</p>
      <p>“The money has been left in public places, where you expect people to be, so they want it to be found.</p>
      <p>“A place like Blackhall, everybody knows everybody and everyone knows their business and yet nobody has a clue.</p>
      <p>“It’s so intriguing, all around the village people are talking about it.”</p>
      <p>Parish clerk Lynda Wardle wondered: “Is it a good person, is it somebody who is trying to make up for bad deeds?</p>
      <p>“It’s so random – who could pick it up? It could be anyone.”</p>
      <p>Blackhall was the home of Bradley Lowery, the mascot who touched the hearts of many in football with his battle against neuroblastoma, and it came to a standstill for his funeral when he died, aged six.</p>

      <p>A barmaid at the Hardwick Hotel, the pub known to locals as The Wick, said: “Is it a modern day Robin Hood? But criminals don’t give their money away.”</p>
      <p>A drinker, who declined to be named, said: “The community is very close here and if someone found £2,000 in the street, you’d expect them to come down The Wick and say ‘everyone can have a pint’.</p>
      <p>“It’s the sort of place where if someone had an extra £2,000, people would know.</p>
      <p>“Maybe someone has won the lottery and when they’ve drunk themselves sober and done everything on their bucket list and not even made a dent in the interest, they could be sick of money.</p>
      <p>“It’s like Brewster’s Millions.”</p>
      <p>Housewife Margaret Guthrie, 59, said: “It doesn’t make any sense at all. I have no idea who has done this.”</p>
