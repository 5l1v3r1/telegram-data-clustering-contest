      <h1>Troubling Details Emerge From Arrest Of NFL RB Mark Walton</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T17:40:18+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 17:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>Earlier today, the Miami Dolphins released running back Mark Walton due to an undisclosed “police matter.” As it turns out, the alleged matter is serious.</p>
      <p>According to media reports, Walton was arrested on Tuesday and charged with aggravated battery of a pregnant person. The charge stems from an incident with a woman who is apparently five weeks pregnant with Walton’s child.</p>
      <p>Walton is accused of pushing the woman into a wall and punching her in the face and head.</p>

      <p>Walton’s arrest and release comes while he was in the middle of serving a four-game suspension for violating the NFL’s conduct and substance abuse policy. The 22-year-old back was arrested three times last offseason.</p>
      <p>“We were made aware earlier this morning of a police matter regarding Mark Walton,” the Dolphins said after cutting Walton this morning. “We hold our players to a high standard and take these matters very seriously. We will have no further comment at this time.”</p>
      <p>Walton rushed for 201 yards on 53 carries this season. He was originally a fourth-round pick of the Cincinnati Bengals in the 2018 NFL Draft</p>
