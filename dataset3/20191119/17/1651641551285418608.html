        <i>Detroit 2038. Technology has evolved to a point where human like androids are everywhere. They speak, move and behave like human beings, but they are only machines serving humans.</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Detroit: Become Human takes the question of “what if robots had feelings?” and makes it a reality. Set in Detroit City during the year 2036, the introduction of Androids into every day life has revitalised modern living. However, the Androids soon start exhibiting almost human behaviour, and it’s up to you to decide how the story goes.</p>
      <p>The game follows the lives (although “lives” is debatable) of three different androids as they grapple with concepts like sentience and morality. The player must decide whether the protagonists will flourish or perish – whether they’ll become human or remain machines.</p>
      <p>You can pre-purchase Detroit: Become Human <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/product/detroit-become-human/home">on the Epic Games Store here</a> ahead of its December 12th launch.</p>
