      <p><b>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (WVLT) —</b> The Tennessee Department of Human Services announced how the state plans to use approximately $342 million in unused Temporary Assistance for Needy Families funds.</p>
      <p>“Unprecedented growth in our state’s economy has created a sharp decline in our TANF qualified population and also generated a generous surplus in funds,” said TDHS Commissioner Danielle W. Barnes. “We now have an opportunity to innovate and better serve our families in need through our<br/>Two-Generation Approach while appropriately saving for a potential downturn in the economy.”</p>
      <p>The plans include a $56 million dollar grant to the Tennessee Department of Health to expand home visitation services.</p>
      <p>A $30 million investment to expand resources for the Tennessee Department of Education.</p>
      <p>A $30 million investment into new resources and assistance for the Tennessee Department of Mental Health.</p>
      <p>A $10 million investment for additional collaboration with the Tennessee<br/>Department of Children’s Services to create a program that assists relative caregivers and helps keep children together with their families and prevention/mitigation of adverse childhood<br/>experiences.</p>
      <p>TDHS will also invest more than $80 million in programming that supports the following efforts:</p>
      <p>• Implementing a child support unit to provide employment and re-entry services to noncustodial parents</p>
      <p>• Employment programming that addresses the medical and mental health needs of Families<br/>First clients</p>
      <p>• After-school programs to provide tutoring, healthy lifestyles, abstinence education, and work force development for teenagers</p>
      <p>• Programming to assist families with transportation barriers in both rural and urban communities.</p>
