      <h1>Henry Cavill Hasn’t Given Up on Playing Superman Again</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T17:40:07+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 17:40</time> by <a rel="author">Tudor Leonte</a></address>
      <p>It may take a while before it happens again, but fans might get a chance to see Henry Cavill’s <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/superman"><b>Superman</b></a> once more. The British actor’s time in the red cape is far from finished, if he has anything to say about it, as he believes he will wear it again in the future. In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a29774618/henry-cavill-the-witcher-superman-interview/">Men’s Health</a>, Cavill stressed that the cape is “in the closet” for now, but he hopes the role is still his.</p>
      <p>The actor summed up his experience as Clark Kent in the DC Extended Universe until now, saying that 2013’s <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/man-of-steel"><b>Man of Steel</b></a> was a “great starting point,” and 2013’s <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/batman-v-superman"><b>Batman v Superman</b></a> “very much a Batman movie,” adding that “that realm of darkness is great for a Batman movie.” As for <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/justice-league"><b>Justice League</b></a>? “It didn’t work,” he concluded.</p>

      <p>Then Cavill addressed the rumors which suggest he is departing from his DC character.</p>
      <p>“I’m not just going to sit quietly in the dark as all this stuff is going on,” Cavill said. “I’ve not given up the role. There’s a lot I have to give for Superman yet. A lot of storytelling to do. A lot of real, true depths to the honesty of the character I want to get into. I want to reflect the comic books. That’s important to me. There’s a lot of justice to be done for Superman. The status is: You’ll see.”</p>
      <p>For now, Cavill is booked as Geralt of Rivia in the upcoming Netflix’s <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/the-witcher"><b>The Witcher</b></a> fantasy series. Should the latter one be a success — which is very probable — Cavill’s cape will likely collect dust in the closet for a while. The fact that the actor is so vocal about his Superman role, though, bodes well for fans who are waiting for Cavill to break his hiatus from Clark Kent.</p>
