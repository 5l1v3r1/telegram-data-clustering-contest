      <p>Whether you're buying for yourself or looking for <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/gifts-for-music-lovers">gift ideas for rock fans</a>, the last few years have seen an explosion in branded beers, wines and spirits – <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/iron-maiden-everything-you-need-to-know">Iron Maiden</a>'s Trooper beer inspiring many other bands, from <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-50-best-metallica-songs-of-all-time">Metallica</a> to <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/buyer-s-guide-motorhead-warts-and-all">Motorhead</a> and <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/marshall-amplification-turn-it-up-to-11-with-launch-of-3-new-craft-beers">Marshall amps</a>, to try their hand at hard liquor for hard rockers.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/best-black-friday-and-cyber-monday-music-deals">Black Friday 2019</a> is coming and there might be booze bargains to be had - but until then here's a quick guide to what's available and where to get it. (And if you really want to keep it real, why not make your own <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/best-home-brew-kits-you-can-buy-right-now">home brew</a>?) </p>
      <p>Please drink responsibly and always remember <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-damned-an-epic-tale-of-fast-living-and-faster-music">Lemmy's rule </a>of drinking: it's not what you drink, or how much you drink, it's how quick you drink it.</p>

      <p>The latest Iron Maiden beer takes it's name from the <i>Piece Of Mind</i> song of the same name, and Cameron's Brewery have described it as one of the most complex beers it has made in its history: a 4.8% ABV pilsner-style, double fermented hybrid lager made with both lager and saké yeasts. Drink it and get banzai'd.</p>
