      <h1>'High quality landscape' that could give Runcorn the 'wow factor'</h1>
      <h2>Plans were filed to build a centrepiece piazza at the heart of the "Station Quarter"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T17:42:36+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 17:42</time> by <a rel="author">Oliver Clay</a></address>
      <p>The regeneration of Runcorn town centre has taken another major step forward as plans were filed to build a centrepiece piazza at the heart of the "Station Quarter".</p>
      <p>Blueprints for the public square have now been formally submitted by <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/halton-council">Halton Borough Council</a> , which is aiming to decide the matter by around January 7.</p>
      <p>The plans show features such as benches, trees, lights, raised grass areas, cycling shelter, stainless steel vehicle bollards, and an information sign.</p>
      <p>A design statement shared exclusively with the ECHO said the the piazza is designed to "create a welcoming arrival experience at Runcorn Station and Runcorn Town Centre", and that the layout will favour pedestrians and cyclists over vehicles, while "providing a safer attractive piazza style square".</p>
      <p>It said the benches are also intended to provide somewhere to wait as an alternative to the usual areas.</p>
      <p>The statement added that the "high quality landscape" can also be used for occasional promotional business stands and exhibitions.</p>

      <p>It said the proposed materials are of a "high quality", mainly using paved stone areas with low sandstone and granite walls and step features.</p>
      <p>The Freeman's Maple and Himalayan Birch tree species have been picked for the piazza, to complement ornamental planting.</p>
      <p>Benches will be made in formal timber, and raised walls will act as seating.</p>
      <p>The statement added that the whole area will be "maintained to a high standard".</p>
      <p>Provisional designs previously released appeared to show the square will include a wind turbine, grassy areas, trees and other greenery, and benches.</p>
      <p>Public consultation is open until December 5 and residents can view the plans and comment <a href="https://webapp.halton.gov.uk/PlanningApps/SendEmail_sql.asp?CaseNo=%2719%2F00579%2FHBCFUL%27&amp;caseOfficer=%27Melissa+Pagan%27">here</a> .</p>
      <p>Once completed, the space will welcome travellers using <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/runcorn">Runcorn</a> Station and provide a view of the town centre beyond, encouraging them to explore the area.</p>

      <p>Cllr Rob Polhill, Halton Council leader, welcomed the plan's submission.</p>
      <p>He said: "The piazza is another step towards the ambition set out in the Runcorn Station Quarter Masterplan.</p>
      <p>"The Station Quarter is part of our commitment to the regeneration of Runcorn - it will transform the area around the station, providing a welcoming first impression of the town, along with improvements to local amenities for residents, passengers, and businesses."</p>
      <p>Until recent demolition works began, the view from the station was filled with a concrete vista from the "Trumpet Loop" flyover.</p>

      <p>That now is a partial pile of rubble, with contractors now manoeuvring a large crane into place to bring down elevated sections of road including Playground Bridge, Station Road Bridge and Picow Farm Road Bridge.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/halton">Halton</a> Council spokeswoman said the crane will lift bridge beams down to floor level, before they are broken down and then transported away.</p>
      <p>The bridge deck will be removed and the piers will be demolished by machines that "munch" the concrete to below ground level.</p>
      <p>Once demolished, the flyover will be replaced with the public space and a roundabout intended to make journeys faster and to make the town centre visible from the station for the first time in decades.</p>
      <p>Work is due to be completed at the end of April 2020, and will allow the Silver Jubilee Bridge to <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/runcorn-widnes-bridge-reopening-delayed-17185667">reopen</a> later next year, when it will be used primarily by borough traffic, cyclists and pedestrians.</p>

      <p>Vehicles from out of area will have to pay a toll to cross the bridge.</p>
      <p>Removing the flyover is also intended to create space for the development of the Station Quarter regeneration project including leisure facilities, housing and space for businesses, and to form a welcoming gateway to the town.</p>
      <p>Discussing the demolition work Tim Gibbs, the council's operational director for policy, planning and transportation, said: “It is only a short distance from Runcorn Station to the town centre, but at the moment people using the station do not make the walk because the concrete wall that greets them is such a barrier.</p>
      <p>"With it gone, we hope this will change.</p>
      <p>"The whole area outside the station will be brighter and more welcoming, creating a much better first impression of the town. I cannot wait to see the results.”</p>

      <p>The council spokeswoman said: “The road improvements will also enable exciting opportunities for future developments that could include new leisure facilities, housing and space for businesses.</p>
      <p>“These improvements are part of a longer term vision to create an impressive ‘gateway’ to Runcorn as part of a new Runcorn Station Quarter.”</p>
