      <p>Kandi Burruss shared a photo featuring herself together with her and Todd Tucker’s boy, Ace Wells Tucker. She said that she will always have his back, and this is entirely understandable – this is the normal attitude a parent should have towards their kids.</p>
      <p>‘I’ll have his back forever! My Acey Pooh! @acewellstucker ❤️ 📸: @photographybyace.llc,’ Kandi captioned her post.</p>
