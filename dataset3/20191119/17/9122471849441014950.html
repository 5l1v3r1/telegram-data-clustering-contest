      <h1>Ryan Day Has Message For Ohio State Fans Going To Penn State Game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T17:47:08+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 17:47</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>College football fans are in for a treat this weekend as Ohio State will host Penn State. It’ll be a crucial game that will ultimately decide which team wins the Big Ten East.</p>
      <p>The Buckeyes took care of business this past weekend against the Rutgers Scarlet Knights. Justin Fields didn’t have to play much since the two sides weren’t remotely close in terms of talent.</p>
      <p>Penn State bounced back from its first loss of the season with an impressive win over Indiana. Even though Sean Clifford wasn’t really effective through the air, he finished the game with 55 rushing yards and three total touchdowns.</p>
      <p>Ohio State will enter this weekend as favorites over Penn State, but Ryan Day knows his team is going to need every advantage it can get this Saturday.</p>
      <p>Since the Buckeyes have home-field advantage for this year’s matchup, Day shared a message for the fans that will be in attendance this weekend.</p>
      <p>“Every time Penn State has the ball, we need everyone to be as loud as they possibly can,” Day said.</p>

      <p>Ohio Stadium is usually very loud for games of this magnitude. Last year, the crowd went into a frenzy when Ohio State dismantled Michigan.</p>
      <p>The Nittany Lions must prepare for an electric atmosphere this Saturday against the Buckeyes.</p>
      <p>Kickoff for this game is at 12 p.m. ET on FOX.</p>
