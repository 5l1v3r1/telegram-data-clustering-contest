      <p>Atlanta rapper T.I. has taped an appearance on Jada Pinkett Smith's Red Table Talk show to explain why he checks his daughter Deyjah's hymen every year.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News)</b> Jada Pinkett Smith has confirmed T.I. will appear on her Red Table Talk show to address his controversial comments regarding his daughter's virginity.</p>
      <p>The musician, real name Clifford Harris, made the controversial comments on the <a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/podcast-hosts-apologize-for-letting-t-i-talk-about-his-daughter-s-sex-life-lYknUAmj8kCJWwt3cB5-9A/">"Ladies Like Us" podcast, co-hosted by singer Miguel's wife Nazanin Mandi.</a></p>

        <a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/actresses-bash-t-i-for-making-sure-his-daughter-is-a-virgin-JcZoBW-MSkWwpAaoRzDQIg/">He explained how important it is to him that his daughter Deyjah Harris waits for the right time before having sex.</a>
      </p>
      <p>"Deyjah's 18, just graduated high school now, and she's attending her first year of college, figuring it out for herself. And yes, not only have we had the conversation (about sex), we have yearly trips to the gynecologist to check her hymen."</p>
      <p>He added: "I will say as of her 18th birthday, her hymen is still intact."</p>
      <p>Speaking to Entertainment Tonight at the American Film Institute (AFI) Fest in Hollywood on Monday, the star announced the "Whatever You Like" hitmaker was set to discuss the remarks on her Facebook Watch series.</p>
      <p>"My next big guest is Tip. T.I. is coming to the table. Yes indeed," she said. "And of course, he's going to address the controversy that has been swirling."</p>
      <p>Confirming the episode had already been recorded, Jada continued: "We just shot that today... And then he and (his wife) Tiny sit down and talk about how they survived, in regards to their marriage."</p>
      <p>While T.I. has yet to address the controversy, Tiny shared a string of eye-roll emojis when a fan asked about the musician's daughter's wellbeing.</p>

        <a href="https://allhiphop.com/news/deyjah-harris-unfollows-t-i-in-wake-of-hymen-checkup-controversy-TvcRD61AYkyKC7wHzDcoBw/">Deyjah also doesn't appear to have taken her dad's comments well, with the teenager – whose mother is singer Ms. Niko – unfollowing him on Instagram and Twitter.</a>
      </p>
      <p>The snub came after she liked several tweets calling the Live Your Life star "possessive", "controlling" and "disgusting".</p>
      <p>T.I. and Tiny will appear on Red Table Talk on November 25th</p>
