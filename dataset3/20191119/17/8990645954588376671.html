      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T17:55:05+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 17:55</time> by <a rel="author">Dave Diamond</a></address>
      <p>It's one of the most popular downtown events of the year, the big <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/346765299330691/">City Lights Christmas Parade</a>, and it's this Saturday evening.</p>
      <p>More than just a Christmas parade, this is a complete downtown festival. Show up early to meet Santa at Park Central at the corner of 8th and Scott. He'll be there to say "Hello-ho-ho" and take pictures with the kiddos before the parade. There will also be a snowball fight and some other activities in the Park Central area. You'll find food vendors just down the street at 9th and Indiana and at the Farmers Market at the corner of 7th and Ohio. Many of the downtown cafes and restaurants will also be open for the festivities.</p>
