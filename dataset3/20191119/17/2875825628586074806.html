      <h2>Katie Price was left gobsmacked when Emily Atack joked Joel Dommett and Adam Thomas should get tested after taking a dip in the same I'm A Celebrity pool that Katie and Peter Andre frolicked in</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T17:19:02+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 17:19</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Katie Price has threatened to fly halfway around the world to have it out with Emily Atack, after the Extra Camp host cracked a brutal STD joke about the mum of five on last night's show.</p>
      <p>Furious Katie demanded Emily's number after the former Inbetweeners star quipped about the pool Katie and Peter Andre frolicked in during their I'm A Celebrity stint in 2004.</p>
      <p>Emily weighed in after her co-hosts Joel Dommett and Adam Thomas were filmed splashing around in the creek where Katie and Peter had canoodled 15 years previously.</p>
      <p>"I hope you boys went to the clinic after being in that pool," Emily joked on camera as she pulled a face.</p>

      <p>But the quip didn't land well back at home, as Katie was reportedly fuming when she heard about Emily's comments from friends.</p>
      <p>"Loads of fans were messaging her on social media too â€“ and Katie was furious," a source told the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10378563/katie-price-threatens-australia-extra-camp-stds/">Sun</a> .</p>
      <p>"She was telling people that she can't believe Emily would say something so snide and if she 'wants a problem, I'll give her a problem'."</p>
      <p>The insider added: "At one point Katie was saying she'd fly out to Australia and confront her. She's not going to, obviously, but she was asking around to see if anyone had Emily's number.</p>

      <p>"She thinks she wouldn't be so brave to say it to her face.</p>
      <p>"Katie reckons she's due a public apology from Emily. She's never had any issue with Emily so she's really shocked by her joke."</p>
      <p>It comes after Katie vowed to snub the show after ITV bosses refused to stick her back in the jungle for the third time.</p>
      <p>The ex-glamour model went on in 2004 - where she famously met Peter - and again in 2009 after they'd split.</p>

      <p>She didn't keep quiet about her plans for the show recently, when she said she'd "definitely" go back on if bosses had her.</p>
      <p>"I did I'm a Celebrity twice and the second time I walked out because I swore on my kids life that's why I left because I couldn't go back on it," she said.</p>
      <p>"The silly thing is the last challenge they wanted me to do was easy, so really I should have stayed in but I didn't."</p>
      <p>"I would definitely do I'm A Celebrity again, 100 percent, third time lucky! Would they have me back in the jungle? Oh my god I could cause another stir!"</p>
      <p>Mirror Online has contacted Katie's rep for comment.</p>
