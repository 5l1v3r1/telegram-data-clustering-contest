      <h1>Judge denies Trump's request to dismiss defamation case against him</h1>

      <p>CNN reports that Donald Trump can be forced to be deposed in a defamation case against him, ruled a New York state Supreme Court Justice.</p>
      <p>Summer Zervos, a a former <i>Apprentice</i> contestant accused Trump of sexually assaulting her. She filed a lawsuit against Trump, who responded by calling her a liar.  Zervos then filed a defamation suit against Trump.</p>
      <p>From <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/19/politics/summer-zervos-trump-defamation-case/?r=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&amp;ref=hvper.com&amp;utm_source=hvper.com&amp;utm_medium=website">CNN</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>After the suit was filed, Trump's lawyers filed a motion to dismiss the case. They have argued the President has immunity from such lawsuits in state courts and that the case would conflict with Trump's official duties. They also said that Trump's frequent denials of accusations made by Zervos and others were protected political speech as statements of opinion.<br/><br/>Schecter dismissed those arguments in March 2018, writing that "no one is above the law."<br/><br/>In her ruling, she cited the 1997 Clinton vs. Jones sexual harassment lawsuit, in which the US Supreme Court held that a sitting president is not immune from being sued in federal court for unofficial acts.</blockquote>
