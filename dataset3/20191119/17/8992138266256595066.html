      <h1>Fidelity Digital Assets Wins NYDFS Approval for a Trust license</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T17:07:38+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 17:07</time> by <a rel="author">Aziz Abdel-Qader</a></address>
      <p>Fidelity’s cryptocurrency investment arm has secured approval to operate as a trust in the state of New York, which allows the company to widen its business beyond just being a <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/fidelity-planning-to-launch-crypto-custodian-service-in-march/">custody for institutional clients</a>.</p>
      <p>The New York Department of Financial Service (NYFDS) has <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/coinbase-fidelity-are-neck-in-neck-in-race-to-acquire-xapo/">granted the brokerage</a> its coveted licence to offer wider crypto-related services in the state, even though retail investors would probably need to wait a little bit longer until they benefit from this new development. Fidelity said earlier it is only targeting institutional customers and not retail investors like E*trade and <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/robinhood-expands-crypto-services-to-8-more-us-states-hires-new-head/">Robinhood</a>.</p>

      <p>The new business unit, dubbed Fidelity Digital Assets, combines Fidelity’s expertise from asset administration with digital asset security, in a bid to provide a safekeeping service for investment houses looking to gain exposure to the rapidly emerging asset class.</p>
      <p>The newly-acquired license, which allows FDAS to operate as a Limited Purpose Trust Company, is wider than NY typical crypto license, or <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/news/ny-authorities-to-revisit-requirements-for-bitlicense/">BitLicense</a>, in a way that it enables its carrier to operate more financial services like offering professional advice.</p>
      <p>“We have experienced a high interest level from these firms and anticipate that their increased involvement in this industry would enable more activities and development across the spectrum,” the company said in a blog post.</p>
