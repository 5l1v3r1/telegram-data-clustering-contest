      <p>As recently as a few weeks ago, Republican lawmakers <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/addybaird/alexander-vindman-sean-duffy-laura-ingraham-republicans">dismissed</a> accusations that impeachment witness and decorated Army officer Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who was born in Ukraine but immigrated to the United States when he was a toddler, was harboring dual loyalties to his birth country. But that didn't stop GOP counsel Steve Castor from hinting at the notion while questioning Vindman during his public impeachment testimony Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Castor spent a few minutes grilling Vindman about Ukraine's former National Security Secretary Oleksandr Danyliuk offering him the job of Ukraine's defense minister three times when Vindman traveled to Ukraine for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's inauguration this year. Vindman, who described the offers as "comical" since he doesn't hold a particularly high rank even in the U.S., calmly responded that he turned it down, <a href="https://twitter.com/shaneharris/status/1196824425187991552">reported</a> it to his superiors in the U.S., and then never gave it a second thought.</p>
      <p>Vindman may have <a href="https://twitter.com/kathrynw5/status/1196825060016832514">kept his composure</a>, but several observers were angered by the questioning, viewing it as a subtle — or maybe not-so-subtle — way for Castor to instill doubts about Vindman's loyalty, especially considering he <a href="https://twitter.com/Noahbierman/status/1196823994999201793">asked</a> Vindman if Danyliuk made the offer in English or Ukrainian. For the record, Vindman says it was the former. Tim O'Donnell</p>
