      <h1>John Potter confirmed as Hibs' new assistant head coach as he reunites with Jack Ross</h1>
      <h2>The duo were initially teammates at St Mirren before linking up once again in England</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T17:04:39+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 17:04</time> by <a rel="author">Ross Pilcher, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/ross-pilcher/</a></address>
      <p>Hibs have confirmed the appointment of John Potter as the club’s new assistant manager.</p>
      <p>The former Dunfermline defender was new Easter Road boss <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jack-ross">Jack Ross</a> ’ first team coach at Sunderland, and has negotiated his departure from the Stadium of Light in order to join him in Edinburgh.</p>
      <p>Potter and Ross first teamed up together as players at St Mirren. The former spent six years in Paisley, winning promotion to the top flight with the Buddies in his first season before being appointed captain.</p>
      <p>Ross joined him as a Saint in 2008, although the pair did not link up again when Ross returned to manage the club in 2016.</p>
      <p>They were eventually reunited on Wearside, but not straight away, with Potter not making the move to the north east until June 2018.</p>

      <p>“It’s a real honour to be joining Jack at Hibernian," Potter said on his appointment via <a href="http://www.hibernianfc.co.uk/news/10414">Hibs' official website</a> .</p>
      <p>“From our own playing and coaching careers in Scotland it’s obviously a club we know all about and we’ll do whatever it takes – alongside the players and staff – to be successful.</p>
      <p>“We’re all just looking forward to Motherwell coming to Easter Road on Saturday now.”</p>
      <p>It had been assumed that Ross’ long-time assistant James Fowler would continue his role as right hand man at Easter Road.</p>
      <p>Fowler attended <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/hibernian-fc">Hibs’</a> home draw with Ross County last month as well as their 5-2 Betfred Cup semi-final defeat to Celtic.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>However, he returned to formative club <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kilmarnock-fc">Kilmarnock</a> as their head of football operations on the same day Ross was officially confirmed as Hibs’ new head coach.</p>
      <p>Current Sunderland boss Phil Parkinson confirmed that there had been contact made regarding Potter’s move north on Monday, and he’s now rejoined Ross in Leith.</p>
