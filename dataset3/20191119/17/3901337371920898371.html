      <p>Molefi Ntseki says he relied on Bafana Bafana’s overseas-based contingent to carry the national team in their win over Sudan at the weekend.</p>

      <p>While the scoreline did not reflect the number of chances created, the coach singled out Kamohelo Mokotjo, Lebo Phiri, Percy Tau and Thulani Serero having given them strict instruction to lift the performance of the team.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Striker Lebo Mothiba was another player expected to carry the goalscoring threat, but struggled throughout the match – perhaps a reflection of his current club form.</p>
      <p>Bafana managed a narrow 1-0 win to register their first three points in their 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers having lost 2-0 to Ghana in the opening round.   </p>
      <p>“We had five of our international players starting the match and the instructions were very clear: give us that international experience in the structure. I think they did very well, especially the four attacking players, except for Lebo (Mothiba), who struggled. It was difficult for him because there was no support. But we tried to correct that at halftime,” said Ntseki.</p>
      <p>Phiri was the goalscorer and the coach explained his role.  </p>
      <p>“You look at how Phiri scored, we said he is playing as a striker every time we play the ball forward. It think offensively those are the players who helped us going forward. These are the five top players,” the Bafana mentor added.</p>
