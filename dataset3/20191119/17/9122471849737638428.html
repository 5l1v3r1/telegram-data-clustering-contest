      <h1>LaMelo Ball Reveals What College He Wanted To Play For</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T17:35:28+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 17:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>There hasn’t been much discussion about the Ball family since the Lakers traded Lonzo Ball to the Pelicans. The family has been a centerpiece of basketball talk shows for years.</p>
      <p>But the talk surrounding Lavar and the Ball brothers has quieted down recently. That may be due to the fact LaMelo now plays overseas.</p>
      <p>The youngest Ball brother plays in Australia in the National Basketball League. What was the motive behind that decision? LaMelo feels it’s his best path to be the No. 1 overall pick in 2020 NBA Draft. But in a recent interview, LaMelo revealed he never thought he’d be playing in a professional league during his college years.</p>
      <p>In fact, the youngest Ball brother had his college plans mapped out, even knowing which university he was going to attend.</p>
      <blockquote>“I thought I was gonna do four years at Chino Hills,” LaMelo said, via <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2862307-the-life-of-lamelo?share=twitter">Bleacher Report</a>. “I thought I was going to go to USC and from there go one-and-done.”</blockquote>
      <p>For a family already harshly criticized, had LaMelo attended USC over UCLA – the school Lonzo played for – there definitely would’ve been some backlash.</p>
      <p>Lonzo became a West Coast superstar during his time with the Bruins. But LaMelo wanted to attend the crosstown rival, perhaps to create a name for himself rather than follow the footsteps of his oldest brother.</p>
      <p>Fortunately for LaMelo, he’s able to solely and quietly focus on basketball as he plays overseas.</p>
