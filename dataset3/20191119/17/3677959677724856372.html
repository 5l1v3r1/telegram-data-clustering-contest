      <p>AMD has announced its latest workstation aimed graphics card, the Navi 10 based <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/graphics/amd-radeon-rx-5700">Radeon Pro W5700</a>. Based on the 7nm RDNA architecture, the AMD Radeon Pro W5700 delivers the same feature set as the consumer aimed Radeon RX series with drivers optimized for design workflows.</p>
      <h3>AMD Radeon Pro W5700 Gets Navi 10 GPU Treatment - Aimed at Workstations With 9 TFLOPs of Compute Horsepower For $799 US</h3>
      <p>The AMD Radeon Pro W5700 is very similar to its consumer, the Radeon RX 5700 but with a couple of changes, mainly on the software side. The AMD Radeon Pro W5700 features 36 compute units so we are getting 2304 stream processors and 64 raster operation units on the Navi 10 chip. It isn't the full variant like the Radeon RX 5700 XT but it does feature a maximum clock speed of 1930MHz which delivers a total compute horsepower of 8.89 TFLOPs.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-zen-3-new-cpu-architecture-significant-ipc-gains-higher-clocks/">AMD Confirms Zen 3 Brings Entirely Brand New CPU Architecture, Delivers Significant IPC Gains, Faster Clocks &amp; Higher Core Counts</a>
      </p>
      <p>In terms of memory, the card features 8 GB of GDDR6 memory running across a 256-bit interface at speeds of 14 Gbps. The card uses the same GDDR6 memory dies as the consumer variant and delivers a total bandwidth of 448 GB/s. Unlike the more recent Vega based offerings, the Radeon Pro W5700 doesn't feature ECC memory correction.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Moving on, the card features a TDP of just 205W which is comparatively good against the older Vega-based Pro lineup. The TDP is essentially the same as the Radeon RX 5700 if we do not factor in the power cost of the USB Type-C connector for VR HMD's. This connector alone requires 15W but when it's not being used, the card should land in the same TDP figures as the Radeon RX 5700. Coming to the design of the card itself, the card is powered by an 8+6 pin connector configuration.</p>

      <p>The Radeon Pro series makes use of the blue and silver color scheme on the shroud. The card is cooled by a single blower type fan which circulates air through the internal chassis which seems to be composed of a vapor chamber based heatsink block. There are six I/O ports on the back of the card which include five mini DisplayPort (DP 1.4) and a USB Type-C port which is aimed at VR based setups, similar to NVIDIA's USB Type-C VirtualLink technology.</p>
