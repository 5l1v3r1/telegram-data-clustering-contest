      <h1>Crowdfunding Watch: GripBeats turns hands movements into music</h1>

        <b>Check out GripBeats a device that wants to turn your hand into a musical instrument, converting movements and touch into sound. It’s currently making waves on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gripbeats/gripbeats-the-multi-functional-wearable-musical-instrument">KickStarter</a>.</b>

      <p>It’s already a massive success on Kickstarter. The project creators write:</p>
      <blockquote>“GripBeats isn’t just any ordinary musical instrument; it’s wearable. And because it’s wearable, it uses your hands’ movements and touch to make music. Everything you thought you could do with an instrument before you can do now, but without it!”<br/><br/>“The term ‘wearable technology’ doesn’t even scratch the surface. GripBeats was made to be a fashion accessory as much as a musical instrument. Take it anywhere, enjoy it anywhere.”</blockquote>
      <p>The device is described as tri-functional because it can serve as a bracelet in “Wrist Mode” (with a unique, slick, spiral design, they say) and also as an extendable Grip controller for the hand in “Grip Mode”. Finally, it can work as a drum pad or surface-piano device in “Surface Mode”. (See videos below.)</p>

      <p>The extent of the range of gestures can be seen in the graphic on the right.</p>
      <p>An LED ring, providing visual feedback, is at the centre of the device and the makers say a vibration motor, to provide haptic feedback, will be embedded once the project takes off.</p>
      <p>It’s also social, in the sense that it plays with friends’ devices, too.</p>

      <h3>Theremin</h3>
      <p>Waving hand movements controlling sounds? Puts me in mind of a theremin…. &lt;you know what’s coming next&gt; …. Cue Jimmy:</p>
