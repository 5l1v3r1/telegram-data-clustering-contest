      <p>It’s always an inconvenience when an online order doesn’t arrive, but for this mum, it sparked something wonderful.</p>
      <p>Caoimhe McConway had ordered some baby-gros for her daughter Féah, and was miffed when they hadn’t come.</p>
      <p>Instead of the parcel she expected, though, she did end up getting something in the post – a card and present from a kind stranger who’d spotted the parcel on the side of the road and decided to do something nice.</p>
      <p>The package had been on some journey, falling off the delivery truck and ripping open, with the baby clothes Caoimhe expected strewn across a road in Kent.</p>
      <p>A woman called Emily had seen this on her school run, and noted down Caoimhe’s Lisburn address, clearly knowing that she’d be missing the clothes for her new baby.</p>
      <p>In the card, Emily told the story, and wrote: ‘I took a photo of your address, and wanted to send a few baby-gros for you, which I hope will fit your little one.</p>

      <p>‘I would have collected them off the road but they were strewn everywhere and all dirty and oily. The road is a busy one too.</p>
      <p>‘Congratulations on your new arrival – always such a precious time’.</p>

      <p>Caoimhe told Metro.co.uk: ‘At first I thought it was the sender who sent me it, then read it and realised it was a complete stranger who happened to find the parcel. I just couldn’t believe a complete stranger would go to them lengths’.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old childcare assistant decided to use social media to find Emily, heartened at her random act of kindness.</p>
      <p>After <a href="https://www.facebook.com/caoimhe.mcconway/posts/960895917613033">posting the story on Facebook</a>, it racked up over 3,400 likes and 2,400 likes.</p>
      <p>‘The online reaction has been crazy,’ said Caoimhe.</p>
      <p>‘I didn’t expect my post to get the response it did.’</p>
      <p>After just four hours, word had got round, and Caoimhe had a message from Emily’s sister (as Emily herself doesn’t use Facebook).</p>
      <p>The pair have become friends, and it’s extremely adorable.</p>
      <p>‘We exchanged numbers and have been in regular contact through WhatsApp,’ said Caoimhe.</p>
      <p>‘Emily has three children and three bonus children as she calls them (step children) – including a wee baby herself at three months,’ she continued.</p>

      <p>‘She seems to have her hands full enough and still manged to do this lovely gesture. I think it’s lovely that two complete strangers have became friends thorough this.’</p>
      <p>As the holiday season approaches, it’s a great reminder that doing something that you might see as insignificant can really make someone’s day. Not only that, but you could come out of it with a brand new friend.</p>
