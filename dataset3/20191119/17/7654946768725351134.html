      <h1>Behind Dwayne Haskins’ Redskins sideline pleas: ‘Sucky situation’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T17:57:11+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 17:57</time> by <a rel="author">Samantha Previte</a></address>
      <p>Redskins offensive lineman Morgan Moses can’t protect his passer on the field, but he’ll try to defend him with the press.</p>
      <p>“What do I have to do to help you? What do I have to do?” were the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/18/dwayne-haskins-begs-for-help-from-redskins-hapless-offensive-line/">words of desperation</a> from quarterback Dwayne Haskins in a <a href="https://twitter.com/NBC4Sports/status/1196180728603656192">viral video</a> from Sunday’s 34-17 loss to the Jets. His impassioned plea was met with apathetic stares and silence from the team’s linemen, but the Redskins right tackle says there’s more to it.</p>
      <p>“It wasn’t him coming to us saying, ‘Hey you guys need to block better,'” Moses explained <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2019/11/18/morgan-moses-says-video-dwayne-haskins-pleading-with-linemen-has-been-misunderstood/">to the Washington Post</a>. “It was him trying to figure out, he knows we’re a veteran group and we’ve seen a lot of things. The things that he can’t see, maybe we can see. I explained to him, like: ‘Hey, bro, we’re in a five-man protection and they’re bringing seven. There’s nothing that we can do.’ We blocked the five, [but] there’s another two that’s free wherever they’re coming from. With that understanding, we have to have something in place to handle that.”</p>
      <p>Haskins was sacked six times on Sunday, and four times in the rookie’s first start in Week 9 against the Bills.</p>
      <p>“He’s a young quarterback and he wants to be great. It’s a sucky situation,” Moses said.</p>
      <p>The 22-year old first-round pick from Ohio State struggled throughout the game to find answers for Jets’ defensive coordinator <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/18/jets-defense-playing-unheralded-role-in-teams-offensive-breakout/">Gregg Williams’ variety of stunts and formations</a>.</p>
      <p>“As a young quarterback, and you have an exotic defense like that, you have a star safety [Jamal Adams] that’s in the box, he’s out the box, he’s a hell of a playmaker,” Moses said. “[Haskins is] trying to figure out where he’s at…Obviously, he’s looking downfield, looking for open receivers and things like that, so when you get sacked, you’re like, ‘Where is he coming from?’ Simply, when there’s a five-man protection and they’re bringing seven, somebody is going to be free.”</p>

      <p>Two fourth-quarter touchdowns by Haskins gave him his first true career highlights, but it was far too late to rally against the Jets.</p>
      <p>Washington’s woes seem to worsen by the day. Their ownership is a permanent fixture of criticism. Head coach <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/07/jay-gruden-fired-after-redskins-start-0-5/">Jay Gruden was fired</a> five games into the year. Their carousel of starting quarterbacks landed at Haskins after veterans Case Keenum and Colt McCoy were given opportunities earlier this season. Seven-time Pro Bowl lineman Trent Williams has not played this year <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/08/redskins-wont-pay-trent-williams-salary-as-feud-escalates/">amid a highly publicized fallout</a> with the team. Sprinkle in a 1-9 record to start the season and it’s the perfect storm of dysfunction.</p>
      <p>In spite of these suboptimal circumstances, Moses sees promise in Haskins and praised the rookie’s efforts.</p>
      <p>“To give credit to the kid, he’s a hell of a football player,” Moses said. “He’s in there willing to learn, he wants to learn, he wants to be great. He’s playing through a lot of things that normal quarterbacks, rookie quarterbacks don’t play through. His head coach got fired after a couple of weeks, and things like that. For him, he’s just trying to find his way. We just have to do a better job of helping him find his way as well.”</p>
