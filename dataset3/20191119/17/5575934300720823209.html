      <p>For its new 16-inch MacBook Pro, Apple went back to using a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/apple-macbook-pro-16-inch-magic-keyboard-similarities-2019-11">traditional keyboard design</a> that’s likely more reliable than the controversial “butterfly” keyboard design that’s plagued Apple’s premium line of laptops since 2016.</p>
      <p>That’s great for Mac users who want Apple’s large MacBook Pro, but the current 13-inch MacBook Pro and MacBook Air still come with butterfly keyboards.</p>
      <p>Ever since their introduction to the MacBook Pro line in 2016,<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/apple-butterfly-keyboard-macbook-issues-timeline-2019-4"> the reliability of Apple’s butterfly keyboard has been questioned</a>. Some users, including myself, have reported keys that double-register, keys that stick, or keys that don’t register at all. Not every MacBook Pro owner with a butterfly keyboard has experienced issues – Apple says only a “small number” of users have been affected.</p>
      <p>Still, there was plenty of media coverage and enough complaints from users that Apple eventually set up a <a href="https://support.apple.com/keyboard-service-program-for-mac-notebooks">keyboard repair program</a>. Apple also rolled out new versions of the butterfly keyboard with every new model year – in 2019, the 13-inch MacBook Pro and the MacBook Air have the 4th-generation butterfly keyboard.</p>
      <p>The latest butterfly keyboard comes with some revisions over previous versions to address the issues, like membranes that cover the key switch made of different materials, and a refreshed dome switch design, according to tech teardown site <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/MacBook+Pro+15-Inch+Touch+Bar+2019+Teardown/123653">iFixit</a>.</p>
      <h3>So, is it ‘safe’ to get a 2019 MacBook with a butterfly keyboard?</h3>
      <p>So far, we haven’t seen any widespread complaints of defective 4th-generation butterfly keyboards – most of the issues still seem to lie with <a href="https://theoutline.com/post/6409/the-new-and-improved-macbook-keyboards-have-the-same-old-problems?zd=4&amp;amp;zi=b6n3mt6m">previous butterfly keyboard generations</a>. That’s a good sign for 2019 13-inch MacBook Pros and MacBook Airs.</p>

      <p>At the same time, confidence in the 4th-generation butterfly keyboard still isn’t high. Apple has included its 2019 13-inch MacBook Pros and MacBook Airs in its keyboard repair program, which is good buffer to have from a consumer point of view, and it’s good that Apple has done so. But it doesn’t suggest that the company is confident that the 4th-generation butterfly keyboard fully resolves the issues with previous generations.</p>
      <p>But at the end of the day, the fact that this year’s 13-inch MacBook Pro and MacBook Air both have those keyboards shouldn’t put you off from buying one of them if you need one.</p>
      <p>And if you’re wondering whether Apple will ditch the butterfly keyboard in its next generation of 13-inch MacBook Pros and MacBook Airs, Apple marketing chief Phil Schiller told <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/apples-phil-schiller-on-reinventing-the-new-macbook-pro-keyboard/">CNET</a> that the company doesn’t plan to abandon the butterfly keyboard, saying Apple is “continuing both keyboard designs.” There are a few murmurs from dubious sources that the next generation of smaller MacBook Pros may ditch the butterfly keyboard, but nothing concrete yet from historically reliable sources.</p>
