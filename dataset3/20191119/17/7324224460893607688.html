      <h2>Midfielder Gareth Barry says he is fit and ready to play if Albion need him to feature against Sheffield Wednesday on Saturday.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T17:38:14+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 17:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/joseph-masi/" target="_blank">Joseph Masi</a></address>
      <p>The 38-year-old has not appeared for the Baggies first-team since suffering a career-threatening knee injury back in March.</p>
      <p>But he has battled his way back to full fitness and has now played two matches over the past few days.</p>
      <p>Barry played in a training game on Saturday and also featured for the reserves in their 4-0 win over Port Vale yesterday.</p>
      <p>And his return is a huge boost for the Baggies who take on Sheffield Wednesday on Saturday without Jake Livermore and Romaine Sawyers – with the duo both suspended after picking up five yellow cards.</p>
      <p>“I feel good,” Barry said.</p>
      <p>“We had a training game on Saturday and another game on Tuesday. I’ve come through both of those unscathed. The knee is feeling good and I’m looking forward to getting back whenever I am needed.</p>
      <p>“There’s nothing like being out there in front of the fans and the adrenaline rushing through.</p>
      <p>“I’ll never put myself out of a game. If the manager asked me what I was thinking in terms of Sheffield Wednesday on Saturday, I’ve always put myself up for selection so it’s then down to the manager and the coaching staff to make a decision on the squad.”</p>
      <p>Barry – the Premier League’s all-time record appearance holder – was actually released by Albion at the end of last season.</p>
      <p>But following his appointment as head coach, Slaven Bilic told the midfielder he would get a new deal if he could prove his fitness.</p>
      <p>And the former England international is grateful for the support his boss has shown in him.</p>
      <p>“From day one Slaven has been fantastic,” he continued.</p>
      <p>“He told me to get myself fit but don’t rush it and we’ll have another conversation.</p>
      <p>“In terms of now, it’s up to me to show the manager what I can do.</p>
      <p>“It’s not about what I have done in the past – I’ve always worked like that.</p>
      <p>“It’s what the manager and the fans will be seeing from now on so I’ll be looking to put some good performances in in training and in games.”</p>
