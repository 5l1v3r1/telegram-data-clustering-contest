      <p>A team of National Institute of Technology, Calicut, (NIT-C) visited the Gap Road on Kochi-Dhanushkodi National Highway, which was closed for traffic following landslips on October 8.</p>
      <p>The five-member team was led by Chandradharan and district geologist B. Ajayakumar. The team inspected the area of the serial landslips that occurred on Gap Road and collected samples of soil and rocks from the region.</p>
      <p>Rex Felix, assistant executive engineer, National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), said that the NIT team would submit an interim report within two days and would submit a detailed report within two weeks. After getting the interim report, a decision on traffic curbs would be made.</p>
      <p>The NIT report will be focussed on how to resume construction without damage. Traffic would be resumed after receiving the recommendations in the final report, he said. The district administration had imposed a traffic curb on Gap Road following the major landslips there on October 8 which killed two persons. After two days, another landslip was reported there. The Gap Road connect tourists from Ernakulam and Thekkady to Munnar.</p>
      <p>On July 28, a major landslip on Gap Road had damaged roadside shops and vehicles parked there. After the landslip, the traffic was suspended in the area for over a month. It was restored on September 7. After the major landslip, there were 14 other landslips reported on the Gap Road stretch. A report submitted by Devikulam Subcollector to the Principal Secretary (Revenue) said that the unscientific road-widening work on the NH resulted in the landslips.</p>
