      <p><b>KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (WVLT) —</b> What's your secret to the perfect turkey? The WVLT News crew is spilling the beans on their secret recipes for a delicious bird.</p>
      <p>- Executive producer<br/>Dave says a little seasoned butter under the skin helps keep the turkey moist and flavorful.</p>
      <p><b>Britanny Tarwater</b> - WVLT News Anchor<br/>Brittany says her family is planning to deep fry the turkey this year.</p>
      <p><b>Chris Milano</b> - WLVT News reporter and producer<br/>"Microwave it."</p>
      <p><b>Megan Sadler</b> - Digital Producer<br/>Brining the turkey in a salt bath with aromatic spices before baking helps keep the turkey moist and full of flavor. You can find instructions on how to complete this process <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/malt-beer-brined-turkey-with-malt-glaze">here</a>.</p>
      <p><b>Tony Budnick</b> - WVLT News at 4 producer<br/>"I've never made a turkey, but the only way to eat it is by covering it with my homemade cranberry sauce."</p>
      <p><b>Heather Haley</b> - Chief Meteorologist <br/>For a small gathering, turkey and stuffing in a slow cooker!</p>
      <p>A small turkey (generally around 3 pounds, depending on the size of your slow cooker), plus a box of stuffing mix, half a cup of chicken broth, and 2 tablespoons of butter.</p>
      <p>Put your turkey, then spread out your boxed stuffing mix around the turkey. Pour your half cup of chicken broth on top and melted butter. Cook on High for 4 hours, and check to make sure your turkey has reached 165° internal temperature before serving.</p>
      <p><b>Ted Hall</b> - WVLT News Anchor<br/>"We do it as a family, my wife Lesa does most of it starting very early in the morning.<br/>We help by saying, mmmmmm that smells good and eating.</p>
      <p>Actually she does the most but our kids and I do chip in where we can (trying not to get in the way).</p>
      <p>We always start playing Christmas music that morning while watching the parade and setting the table.</p>
      <p>The must haves, turkey, sweet potatoes with marshmallows, mashed potatoes, green bean casserole, gravy and plenty of pumpkin pie.</p>
      <p>We always go around the table (usually some guests join us) and say something we're thankful for.</p>
      <p>After lunch, football, board games and cards then end Thanksgiving by watching Elf.</p>
      <p>One of our favorite days every year!</p>
      <p><b>Kayla Fuller</b> Photojournalist<br/>"Here's how I do it: I make any side dish and then drive to my grandparents, and the turkey will be sitting on the table ready to eat! It's amazing how that works!"</p>
