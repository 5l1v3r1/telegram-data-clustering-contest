      <p>LABUAN (Nov 19): The Labuan Tiong Hua Chamber of Commerce has sent a proposal to address the infrequent flights and costly airfare issues to rural air services provider, MASwings.</p>
      <p>Its president, Datuk Wong Kii Yii said the proposal was submitted in view of the continuous complaints from the people — especially from the business community — who have voiced their grievances on the difficulties in returning home.</p>
      <p>“We are very much concerned about the domestic flight airfares from and to Labuan provided by the MASwings, and we hope the rural air services carrier will consider it and convince the relevant authorities to give attention to our plights,” he told reporters after handing over the proposal.</p>
      <p>Among other things, the chamber also recommended for the airline to introduce a special airfare for the disabled and senior citizens as well as a special rate for groups and families.</p>
      <p>Wong said the authorities, including the Malaysia Aviation Commission (MAVCOM) and Ministry of Transport (MOT), must not look at Labuan residents as high income earners, although the duty-free island is an oil and gas hub.</p>
      <p>“There are still people who are in the B40 category (with household incomes of below RM4,000) and a high number of them are still living below the poverty line.</p>
      <p>“Therefore, it is not fair to categorise Labuan people as high income earners and don’t deserve low airfare,” he said.</p>
      <p>Wong said the chamber was ready to meet with the MAVCOM and MOT, together with MASwings officials to resolve the issues.</p>
      <p>MASwings chief executive officer Aminuddin Zakaria said he would bring up the issues highlighted by the chamber to MAVCOM and MOT for a thorough study.</p>
      <p>“I listened to the grievances and recommendations from the chamber and I will brief MAVCOM and MOT officials on the issues,” he added. <i>— Bernama</i></p>
