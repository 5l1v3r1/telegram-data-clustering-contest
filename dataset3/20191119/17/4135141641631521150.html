      <p>This is Winter Classic cool.</p>
      <p>Cameras caught the reactions of several of the <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nhl/dallas-stars-team">Dallas Stars</a> players as they set their sights on the new jerseys the team will be wearing at the Cotton Bowl on January 1st when they face the <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/nhl/nashville-predators-team">Nashville Predators</a> in the Winter Classic.</p>
      <p>Old school, yet modern…head coach Jim Montgomery describes it perfectly.</p>
