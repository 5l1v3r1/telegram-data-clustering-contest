      <h1>Lori Loughlin Should Have Been A Part Of The Final Season Of Fuller House, Says Andrea Barber</h1>

      <p>The final season of <i>Fuller House</i> will premiere on Netflix soon, but a familiar face won’t be a part of it. Lori Loughlin – who played Aunt Becky for eight seasons on the original <i>Full House</i> and four seasons on <i>Fuller House</i> – did not return to the show after she was charged in the Operation Varsity Blues college admissions scandal, but her co-star <a href="https://celebrityinsider.org/fuller-house-star-andrea-barber-reveals-in-new-memoir-that-new-kids-on-the-block-helped-her-get-through-her-divorce-340968/">Andrea Barber</a> says she “should have been there” for the finale.</p>
      <p>While speaking with <i>People Now</i>, Barber said that Loughlin’s absence from the fifth and final season was really sad, and everyone could feel her absence.</p>

      <p>“It just felt like there was a hole in the whole season but also in that final episode,” said the 43-year-old actress who stars as Kimmy Gibbler. “She should’ve been there, and I’m sorry that she wasn’t.”</p>
      <p>Barber says that Loughlin is one of the sweetest, kindest, and most down-to-earth people she has ever met, and she loves her unconditionally. She revealed that she still keeps in touch with Loughlin, and she says that her former co-star is doing as good as she possible, even though she is facing years in prison.</p>
      <p>“She’s just a sweetheart, and she’ll always be family to me,” said Barber.</p>
      <p>It’s not clear what the fate of Aunt Becky’s character is during the final season, but they did write her off after federal prosecutors charged Loughlin and her husband Mossimo Giannulli with conspiracy to commit federal programs bribery, money laundering conspiracy, and conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud and honest services mail and wire fraud.</p>
      <p>Loughlin and Giannulli allegedly paid William Singer $500,000 to get their daughters Olivia Jade and Isabella Rose priority admission to the University of Southern California as members of the crew team, even though neither of them participated in the sport.</p>

      <p>The couple has pleaded not guilty to the charges against them, and they are waiting for their day in court. If convicted, the couple could be sentenced to up to 50 years in prison. Their trial is expected to begin next year.</p>
      <p>The final season of <i>Fuller House</i> will feature 18 episodes, and the first half of the season is expected to be available for streaming on Netflix in December 2019. And, the second half of the season will most likely be released in the summer of 2020. And, Andrea Barber’s new memoir <i>Full Circle: From Hollywood to Real Life and Back Again</i> is now available in bookstores.</p>
