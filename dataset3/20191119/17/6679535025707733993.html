      <p>Tension prevailed on the Collectorate premises when a few people, who came to participate in the tender process, were prevented by a few others leading to clashbetween them here on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The Department of Mines and Geology had invited tenders for rough stone and gravel quarry projects at Chennampatti village in Anthiyur Taluk. The opening of tender was earlier scheduled for November 12 at the department located at the Collectorate. However, dispute prevailed on the day when one group prevented others from submitting tender documents. The tender date was rescheduled for November 19.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, police pickets were posted at the Collectorate to prevent untoward incidents. The tender process began in the presence of District Revenue Officer S. Kavitha. When officials asked interested persons to submit tender documents, a group of men said to be from the AIADMK, prevented others from entering the hall and submitting documents. Altercation broke out resulting in scuffle as persons who were prevented from entering the hall staged sit-in-protest. They also raised voice against the officials and the police. Since the time for submitting documents ended, the police closed the doors and officials announced the allocation of the quarrying rights to the persons concerned. All the four quarries were leased for â‚¹ 1.27 crore.</p>
