      <p>The 32nd Thrissur Revenue District School Art Festival began at venues in and around Guruvayur on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Thrissur district panchayat president Mary Thomas inaugurated the festival. Addressing the inaugural function, cine actor V.K. Sreeraman said students now tend to shrink to a world they create for themselves. “But art helps them turn their radar towards the outer world,” he said.</p>
      <p>The four-day festival is being held at six venues such as Sree Krishna Higher Secondary School Guruvayur; Government Higher Secondary School, Chavakkad; GUPS, Guruvayur; Little Flower Girls Convent School, Mammiyur; LFUP School, Mammiyur; and Shikshak Sadan, Muthuvattur.</p>
      <h3>Arabic, Sanskrit festivals</h3>
      <p>In all 6,125 students will participate in 25 events in the four-day festival. There will be Arabic and Sanskrit festivals too. Students from 12 sub-districts are participating in the festival. Apart from off-stage events, contests in Bharatanatyam, drama, Mohiniyattam, English recitation, English speech, group dance and Vrindavadyam were held on the inaugural day.</p>
      <p>Education Minister C. Ravindranath will address the valedictory on Friday.</p>
