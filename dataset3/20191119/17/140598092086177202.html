      <p>Gracious, elegant and with standards of hospitality that are second to none, The Merrion exudes period charm from its prime position in the heart of Dublin. Admire the beautiful courtyard garden – a rarity in a central Dublin hotel – and spend time in the tranquil Tethra Spa, with its delightful blue-tiled pool and full range of treatments.

      <p>The signature red-brick Victorian façade of The Shelbourne Dublin has glowed on the northern side of St Stephen's Green since 1824. Its main bar and Saddle Room restaurant are popular fixtures on the city's social scene, and afternoon tea in the Lord Mayor's Lounge is something of a Dublin tradition. Rooms are naturally very well-appointed, with some boasting splendid views across the treetops of the Green to the distant mountains. The spa area is delightful, complete with treatment areas, a gym, a top-lit 18-metre pool and a wonderful relaxation space, with park views and cocktails. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/ireland/dublin/hotels/the-shelbourne-hotel/">Read expert review</a> From £ 178 per night <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/ie/the-shelbourne-dublin-a-renaissance.html?aid=839822;label=TMG-1travel1destinations1europe1ireland1dublin1articles1best0spa0hotels0dublin-The2Shelbourne2Dublin">Check availability</a> Rates provided by Booking.com</p>

      <p>The Marker is glamorous, fashionable, and smarter than smart. It boasts a prime location (BGE Theatre is immediately adjacent), ritzy interiors and a rooftop bar with vistas across the Dublin docklands. The modern spa and wellness area is the big draw, and it's extremely impressive: by turns spacious and enveloping, with a cool, smooth palette of greys to create a sense of intimacy. That fabulous emerald-green infinity pool comes in at a generous 75ft; there's also a commodious whirlpool, plus a gym and very extensive range of treatments. Bedrooms are spacious and inviting, and service is polished. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/ireland/dublin/hotels/the-marker-hotel/">Read expert review</a> From £ 193 per night <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/ie/the-marker.html?aid=839822;label=TMG-1travel1destinations1europe1ireland1dublin1articles1best0spa0hotels0dublin-The2Marker2Hotel">Check availability</a> Rates provided by Booking.com</p>

      <p>This is everything a landmark seaside hotel ought to be: handsome, grand, nicely maintained, a local focus point – and in a splendid setting: on rising ground overlooking the great piers of picturesque Dún Laoghaire harbour, with views across Dublin Bay.
