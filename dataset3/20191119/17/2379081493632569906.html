      <p>LONDON/ATHENS — Italy’s biggest loan recovery firm doValue has emerged as the strongest bidder for Eurobank’s loan servicing unit, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, a deal critical for the turnaround of Greece’s third largest lender.</p>
      <p>Discussions are at an advanced stage as Eurobank wants to find a new owner for its Financial Planning Services (FPS) business by mid December, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity.</p>
      <p>U.S. money manager PIMCO is also in the race, but its offer is seen as less competitive, they said, adding PIMCO previously failed to clinch a deal ahead of a September deadline.</p>
      <p>“DoValue’s bid has an edge,” said a source familiar with Eurobank’s strategy.</p>
      <p>Representatives at Eurobank, doValue and PIMCO declined to comment.</p>
      <p>Eurobank is under pressure from European Central Bank (ECB) supervisors to cut its problem loans, which comprise more than a third of its total lending.</p>
      <p>It is looking to sell about 80% of FPS for more than 300 million euros ($332 million), the sources said, with one adding doValue’s bid is about 15% higher than PIMCO’s.</p>
      <p>Big portfolio sales have opened up a lucrative market for investors in risky assets.</p>
      <p>Loan recovery units such as FPS, which carry with them long-term debt collection contracts, are particularly sought after, and banks have been selling them together with bundles of loans.</p>
      <p>But any decision on FPS will need to take into account new legislation on non-performing loans that the Greek government is finalizing.</p>
      <p>The bill, known as the Hercules asset protection scheme, aims to accelerate the clean up of banks’ finances in a sector burdened with 75 billion euros of soured loans.</p>
      <p>The scheme will offer state guarantees for senior tranches of the securitisations on condition that banks manage to sell at least 51% of mezzanine and junior tranches to investors.</p>
      <p>“It’s not a simple comparison of prices offered for FPS,” said the source familiar with Eurobank’s strategy.</p>
      <p>“The bids are more complex and will hinge on the final version of the Hercules scheme.”</p>
      <p>Eurobank initially snubbed a preliminary bid by Verona-based doValue, controlled by Softbank-backed Fortress Investment Group.</p>
      <p>In July it selected PIMCO, its sixth-biggest investor, as its preferred bidder for FPS, giving the U.S. money manager three months to carry out due diligence and reach an accord.</p>
      <p>But the deadline passed without a deal, forcing Eurobank to resume talks with doValue.</p>
      <p>The Italian firm has existing operations in Greece and has made international expansion across Southern Europe a key focus.</p>
      <p>Last year, it clinched a deal with Eurobank and three other lenders to manage 1.8 billion euros in soured corporate loans and then swooped on Spanish bad-loan manager Altamira.</p>
