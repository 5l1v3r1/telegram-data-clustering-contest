      <p>A man punched a barber shop owner and threatened to burn down his business after being confronted about using electricity to charge his phone, a court has been told.</p>
      <p>Noel McGaw was given a four-month suspended jail term for the attack, which also involved kicking in a window at the premises in north Belfast.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old, of Lochinver Drive in the city, was convicted of common assault, criminal damage and threats to damage property at the Bhoys Barbers on the Antrim Road.</p>
      <p>Belfast Magistrates' Court heard he became violent during an encounter with the proprietor on September 17 this year.</p>
      <p>A prosecution lawyer said McGaw came into the barber shop on a regular basis, using its electricity to charge his phone without availing of any other services.</p>
      <p>When confronted about it outside the business he responded aggressively, kicking and smashing a glass panel in the door.</p>
      <p>McGaw was then said to have punched the owner as he tried to phone police.</p>
      <p>In an incident witnessed by other members of the public, he also threatened to burn down the shop.</p>
      <p>Defence counsel Michael Boyd told the court his client's behaviour was fuelled by alcohol.</p>
      <p>The barrister submitted that McGaw is trying to address his problems, and has been given a chance by another court.</p>
      <p>Imposing four months' imprisonment, District Judge Fiona Bagnall suspended the sentence for 18 months.</p>
      <p>She also ordered McGaw to pay Â£100 compensation to cover the cost of replacing the broken shop window.</p>
