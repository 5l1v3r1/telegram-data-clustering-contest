      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a> star <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/adele/">Adele</a> Roberts confused fellow campmates and viewers at home as to why <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/im-celebrity-fans-baffled-adele-roberts-chooses-framed-photo-jane-mcdonald-luxury-item-11178692/">her luxury item was a photo of Jane McDonald</a> – well now her girlfriend has finally cleared it up.</p>
      <p>Kate Holderness took to social media to put the rumours to rest and to reveal why her partner decided to take in her beloved photo of the cruise-ship singer.</p>
      <p>And it turns out, Adele loves ‘a bit of Jane’ to cheer her (and her Radio 1 listeners) up if they’re having a bad day.</p>
      <p>‘I can clear this up. All the campmates have to have different luxury items, they’re not allowed to double up on anything,’ Kate began.</p>
      <p>‘So Adele’s first choice of a family photo was already taken which she didn’t mind because she knew there’d be campmates who’d love a pic of their children in there with them.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘Second choice, a pillow, was another goner as it’s usually the most requested item. Pretty much everything she wanted after that was already taken too.’</p>

      <p>She continued: ‘The brief was “something to make you happy” so she chose something that never fails to cheer her up and something that reminds her of early morning Radio 1 listeners – it’s a bit of a long running feature on Adele’s show, when they’re having a bit of a slump and feeling down a listener will request “a bit of Jane” to get them through the day.</p>
      <p>‘I do have to say that most of her decisions are made at 2am when she gets up for her show, most things make perfect sense as that time.’</p>
      <p>So now…we know.</p>

      <p>Declaring the star a ‘national treasure’, Adele said: ‘She is the queen of Wakefield.</p>

      <p>While viewers were baffled (but absolutely loved the random item), Jane has now spoken out about the moment and said that she is now excited to meet her radio DJ superfan.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Holly and Phil, she said: ‘I’m absolutely gobsmacked! I was just like… my phone started going ding, ding, ding, ding, ding!</p>
      <p>‘I was sat, because I’ve been sitting here filming in Manchester.</p>
      <p>‘I just sat on the edge of the bed in my underwear, and watched it on Plus One, and just thought, “oh my goodness me!” I could not believe it.’</p>
