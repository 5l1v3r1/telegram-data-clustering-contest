      <p><b>Stockholm</b>: A Swedish prosecutor says the alleged rape investigation involving WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is currently in prison in Britain, has been discontinued.</p>
      <p>Deputy Chief Prosecutor Eva-Marie Persson spoke Tuesday as she gave an update on the Swedish case.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>In June, a Swedish court ruled that Assange should not be detained, meaning that while a preliminary investigation in Sweden shouldn't be abandoned, he wouldn't be extradited and could be questioned in Britain.</p>
      <p>Two months earlier, Assange was evicted from the Ecuador Embassy in London where he had been holed up since 2012.</p>
      <p>He was immediately arrested and is currently serving a 50-week sentence in Britain for jumping bail in 2012.</p>
      <p>He is also fighting extradition to the US, which accuses him of publishing secret documents.</p>
