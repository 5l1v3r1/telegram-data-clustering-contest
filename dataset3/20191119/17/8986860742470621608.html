      <p>Ghanaian celebrated boxer Braimah Kamoko aka Bukom Banku who was recently banned by the Ghana Boxing Association has revealed the reason why he is yet to honour a rematch fight between himself and Bastie Samir.</p>
      <p>According to the cruiserweight boxer, if Bastie Samir does not kill him in the ring, he might get a stroke if he grants him a rematch.</p>
      <p>In an interview, the controversial boxer said that during his first fight with Bastie, fear gripped him as soon as he entered into the ring for the bout.</p>
      <p>He said after his first fight with Bastie, he almost got a stroke and didn’t want that to happen again to him.</p>
      <p><i>“I nearly got a stroke during that fight. I don’t know the power Bastie has but when I entered the ring, I started seeing Bastie as a very huge person who was bigger than me. Meanwhile, Bastie is a very short boxer,”</i> Bukom Banku said.</p>
      <p>Watch his interview below:</p>
      <p>He added that he felt as if the whole of Ghana was against him when he fought Bastie.</p>
      <p><i>” You wanted Bastie to beat your champion and Bastie beat your champion so what again. He should go ahead with his career and forget me because I won’t fight him again. If I fight Bastie again, if I don’t get a stroke, I will die,” </i>Banku disclosed.</p>
