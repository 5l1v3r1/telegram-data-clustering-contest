      <p><b>WOONSOCKET, R.I.Â (AP)</b> - The first Roman Catholic church in Woonsocket, Rhode Island has been granted permission to close by the Diocese of Providence.</p>
      <p>The Diocese says Bishop Thomas Tobin granted the request by St. Charles Borromeo Catholic Church and sends his prayerful support to members of the parish.</p>
      <p>Officials say attendance dropped from 230 people in 2012 to 90 for weekend Masses.</p>
      <p>The diocese estimates that the building also needs more than $570,000 in repairs for a new roof, a renovated heating system and new stained-glass windows.</p>
      <p>The last Masses are scheduled for Jan. 11 and 12.</p>
