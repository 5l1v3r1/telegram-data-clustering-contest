      <p>Given his many, many projects – from fronting <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/slipknot/">Slipknot</a> and <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/stone-sour/">Stone Sour</a>, to writing books and even trying his hand at acting – it was only going to be a matter of time before <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/corey-taylor/">Corey Taylor</a> squeezed a solo album into his repertoire. And having revealed <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/corey-taylor-is-planning-a-solo-album/">back in August</a> that he was hoping to start work on one in 2021, it seems as though the vocalist/guitarist has majorly fast-tracked that process already.</p>
      <p>In a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXT40wrVGEw&amp;t=1s">WhatCulture Music</a>, Corey has revealed that he’s already got basically not one but <i>two</i> albums’ worth of material, having written 26 songs for the as-yet-untitled release. He also revealed the style of this solo music, opting for some “harder-edged stuff, but there also will be big, expansive, huge, world-changing guitar songs that you’re going to want to sing along to”. Nice…</p>

      <p>Check out his full comments on the solo album – transcribed by <a href="https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/corey-taylor-says-he-has-written-26-songs-for-rock-meets-so-many-different-things-solo-album/">Blabbermouth</a> below:</p>
      <p>“The great thing about being a fan is you never forget the passion you have for music. You never forget the songs that you love. For me, there’s no such thing as a guilty pleasure, so I’m going to listen [to] and play whatever I want.</p>
      <p>“It’s been cool to kind of start building the momentum for a potential solo run… It’s definitely going to be rock-based, but it’s going to be rock meets so many different things. There will be harder-edged stuff, but there also will be big, expansive, huge, world-changing guitar songs that you’re going to want to sing along to. That’s just who I am, and I’m not going to fight who I am. I’ve got 26 songs written, and I’m not done yet.”</p>

      <p>Away from his solo work, catch Corey and Slipknot live in the UK next year, with the mighty <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/behemoth/">Behemoth</a> in tow.</p>
      <p>“It feels good to be coming back for an extensive tour of Europe and the UK,” says Corey. “No matter how many times we come there, it always feels like we can never get enough, nor play all the cities we want to. But one thing’s for certain: the audiences are always some of the best in the world.”</p>
