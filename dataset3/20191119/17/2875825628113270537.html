      <p>Harry Potter actor Rupert Grint has revealed cast mates <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/emma-watson">Emma Watson</a> and Tom Felton were more than just friends.</p>
      <p>Rupert, who played Ron Weasley in the magical franchise, said there was "romance" between Emma, who played Hermione Granger, and Tom, who played Draco Malfoy.</p>
      <p>The cast worked together for ten years as they worked on the eight films, beginning in their early teens.</p>
      <p>And Rupert has cheekily called the spark between Emma and Tom a "playground romance", adding that he could see see the two of them together.</p>
      <p>He told <a href="https://www.etonline.com/">Entertainment Tonight</a> : "There was always something. There was a little bit of a spark.</p>

      <p>"But we were kids. It was like any kind of playground romance."</p>
      <p>Rupert insisted his own experience was "spark free", and him and Emma have previously spoken about the awkwardness of sharing an on screen kiss when they had grown up together as pals.</p>
      <p>Rupert has been dating Angus, Thongs and Perfect Snogging star Georgia Groome since 2011.</p>

      <p>Tom split from his long term girlfriend Jade Gordon in 2016, while Emma recently announced she was happily " <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/single-emma-watson-says-shes-20813562">self-partnered</a> ".</p>
      <p>She admitted to Jonathan Ross that she once had a crush on Tom.</p>
      <p>"Between the ages of 10 and 12, I had a really terrible crush on Tom Felton", she giggled.</p>
      <p>"We love a bad guy and he was a few years older and he had a skateboard. And that just did it, really.</p>
      <p>"He used to do tricks on it. He was so cool."</p>

      <p>And Potterheads will be delighted to hear how he gushed over Emma to the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/">MailOnline</a> , saying: "It’s always nice to bump into her, see her at the beach, or over dinner, or whatever.</p>
      <p>"She’s an incredibly smart and lovely young lady, so it’s always nice to bump into each other and slightly reminisce about old times but also about looking forward to the future."</p>
      <p>He also revealed the cast try to meet when they can, and when they do "it's like no time has passed at all".</p>

      <p>And he confessed he would be delighted to reunite for another Harry Potter fim.</p>
      <p>"But, seriously, if there was another chance to be in another movie then I’m sure all of us would jump at the chance to be part of it", he said.</p>
      <p>"I don’t think Jo [Rowling] would want her films, her books rather and her films, to be remade anytime soon.</p>

      <p>"But I’m sure in 20 years when they’ve got 4D, scratch-and-sniff cinemas, or whatever, then they’ll want to do it all over again.</p>
      <p>"My hope is that when they do it I’ll be old enough to play Lucius!</p>
      <p>"Give it another 15 years and I’ll come back and play Lucius. I would do it in a heartbeat."</p>
