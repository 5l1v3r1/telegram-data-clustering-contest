      <p>A 120-year-old photo circulating online appears to prove that Greta Thunberg is both a time traveller AND a gold digger.</p>
      <p>The black-and-white image, <a href="https://digitalcollections.lib.washington.edu/digital/collection/hegg/id/601/">found</a> in the archives of the University of Washington, shows three children working at a gold mine in the historic Klondike gold district and was made around 1898, if the description is correct.</p>
      <p>The eerie part is the girl in the foreground, who looks exactly like Greta Thunberg. The pigtails are also there.</p>

      <p>Casting aside the down-to-earth time-travel-is-impossible trifle, as well as the obvious lookalike theory, this leaves us with just one possible explanation: Greta hopped in a (hopefully zero-emissions) time machine and went straight to our days to save the planet. Or vice versa.</p>
      <p>Of course, this is just humour, and the real Greta <a href="https://sputniknews.com/environment/201911131077295270-flightless-climate-activist-greta-thunberg-hitches-yacht-ride-back-to-europe/">is somewhere out there in the Atlantic</a>, navigating her way back home. But some people have picked up the conspiracy and are now spreading the word about Greta’s time-bending powers, apparently in jest.</p>
