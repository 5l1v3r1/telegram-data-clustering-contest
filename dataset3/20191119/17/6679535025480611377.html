      <p>Telangana Health Minister Eatala Rajender has sought help from Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare Harsh Vardhan in establishing Regional Cancer Centres in Adilabad and Warangal. Currently, there is only one such centre in Red Hills, Hyderabad, where patients from across the State avail services.</p>
      <p>Mr. Rajender, who is in Delhi to attend 2019 World Conference on ‘Access to Medical Products: Achieving the SDGs 2030’, met the Union Health Minister. At end of August, the Union Cabinet approved setting up of 75 medical colleges in three years.</p>
      <p>The State Health Minister has requested that at least two or three of them be established in any of the seven districts in Telangana. Bhadrachalam, Khammam, Jayashankar Bhupalapally, Tandur, Vikarabad, Sangareddy and Macherial, were pitched for the purpose. Discussions were also held regarding two super-speciality blocks, trauma care centres along highways, in the State.</p>
