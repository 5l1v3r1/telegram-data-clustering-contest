      <h1>Turkmenistan stages first opera after 19-year ban</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T17:30:16+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 17:30</time> by <a rel="author">Anton Lomov (AFP)</a></address>
      <p>Reclusive Turkmenistan staged its first foreign opera on Tuesday, nearly 19 years after the Central Asian country's founding president banned the art form as "incompatible with Turkmen mentality".</p>
      <p>A state theatre in the capital Ashgabat was packed for the staging of 19th century Italian composer Ruggero Leoncavallo's opera "Pagliacci" ("Clowns") as part of an international drama festival.</p>
      <p>Older spectators leaving the theatre late on a cool Tuesday night voiced a nostalgia for the long-taboo art form while younger spectators enthused over the performance.</p>
      <p>Mekan Byashimov, a 54-year-old schoolteacher said he hoped that operas would be staged regularly and that ballet would also make a reappearance on the national stage.</p>
      <p>"We used to have good premieres. I went regularly. If we want to call ourselves a cultured nation, we need to restore opera and ballet," Byashimov told AFP.</p>
      <p>Aina Shiryayeva, a 20-year-old student watching opera for the first time said she had enjoyed the performance despite not understanding any of the words.</p>
      <p>"The music and the artists! Everything was so wonderful. I am delighted. I have seen the opera!" she said.</p>
      <p>Gas-rich Turkmenistan's eccentric first leader Sapurmurat Niyazov banned opera as well as foreign ballet in 2001 in what he posited was a move to protect Turkmen culture.</p>
      <p>The ban on art forms closely associated with Soviet and Russian imperial rule continued under second president Gurbanguly Berdymukhamedov, who came to power after Niyazov's death in 2006.</p>

      <p>The director of Tuesday's joint Turkmen-Italian performance Daniele de Plano told AFP in an interview that Pagliacci was staged as part of a "cultural exchange programme" between Italy and Turkmenistan.</p>
      <p>He said he felt "honoured to be the first director to bring back opera" to Muslim-majority Turkmenistan.</p>
      <p>"I really hope this is the beginning of a new path of ties becoming closer between Turkmenistan and opera, particularly Italian opera," said de Plano.</p>
      <p>Of the main roles in the performance only one was played by an Italian, with the others filled by Turkmen singers.</p>
      <p>Baritone Amangeldi Amanov was singing for the second time the part of Silvio -- a lover who gets murdered by a jealous husband, the opera's lead character, Canio.</p>
      <p>The first time he played the role in March 2001 was his debut and also the last time that opera was performed in Ashgabat, a city of one million.</p>
      <p>"This is historic for us. Our younger generation is coming into contact with European culture. This performance is a first step in the comeback of the Turkmen operatic tradition," Amanov enthused in an interview with AFP before the performance.</p>
      <p>Strongman Berdymukhamedov has maintained many of the repressive policies of his late predecessor, whom he once served as a personal dentist.</p>
      <p>Both men are honoured by golden statues in Ashgabat, testifying to leadership cults that draw regular comparisons with North Korea.</p>
