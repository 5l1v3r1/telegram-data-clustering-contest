      <p>ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) — The state of Michigan has issued the first licenses to a business planning to grow and sell marijuana for recreational use.</p>
      <p>Ann Arbor-based Exclusive Brands already has medical marijuana operations. It received recreational licenses Tuesday. It wants to start selling marijuana to adults age 21 and over as soon as Dec. 1.</p>
      <p>Recreational marijuana is unlikely to be available on a widespread basis in Michigan until licensed growers can harvest the first crop, possibly in March or April.</p>
      <p>Also getting licenses Tuesday were PSI Labs in Ann Arbor, which tests marijuana, and Real Leaf Solutions, a Kalkaska-based company that plans to organize marijuana events.</p>
