      <h2>But invite RTC staff for talks to resolve issues, JP writes to KCR</h2>

      <p>Foundation for Democratic Reforms (FDR) and Lok Satta founder Jayaprakash Narayan has written to the Chief Minister, K. Chandrasekhar Rao, to invite Telangana State Road Transport Corporation employees for talks as they have reportedly dropped the demand for merger of RTC with the government.</p>
      <p>In a letter addressed to the Chief Minister on Tuesday, Dr. Narayan said the government’s decision to reject the demand for RTC merger with the government was a right policy decision and the FDR also welcomed it. It was not required for the government to provide those services as a monopoly when there was competition from many players in the private sector to provide the same services.</p>
      <p>However, other demands of the RTC employees should be looked into. It would be proper for the Chief Minister to call the employees for talks and consider their issues sympathetically.</p>
      <p>Dr. Narayan, in his letter, said the government’s main responsibility was to implement the rule of law, basic amenities, quality education and health and efficient delivery of services to people in government offices. If the government allocated resources to services that were not its core responsibility, common people would suffer and important areas like health and education in the public sector would be adversely affected. Thus the FDR and Lok Satta supported the decision not to merge RTC with the government.</p>
      <p>“In the wake of RTC workers not focusing on the merger demand, it will be fair if you hold talks and resolve the RTC strike in the interest of public,” he said in his letter.</p>
