      <p>Despite winning the Copa America in July, pressure had been slowly building on head coach <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/tite/"><b>Tite</b></a> following a poor run of results that included defeats to Peru and bitter rivals Argentina – the latter on Friday in Dubai – and draws with Colombia, Senegal and Nigeria.</p>
      <p>But goals from AC Milan striker <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/lucas-paqueta/"><b>Lucas Paqueta</b></a>, on-loan Bayern Munich midfielder <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/philippe-coutinho/"><b>Philippe Coutinho</b></a> and Juventus defender <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/danilo/"><b>Danilo</b></a> saw off the Koreans at the Mohammed bin Zayed Stadium.</p>

      <p>Brazil took the lead in the ninth minute courtesy of a well-worked goal sparked by Coutinho, whose ball on the overlap to left-back Renan Lodi resulted in a chipped cross from the edge of the area for Paqueta to stoop and head home from five yards.</p>
      <p>South Korea captain <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/son-heung-min/"><b>Son Heung-min</b></a> tried to drag his side back into the game, initially forcing Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson into a low save with a 22-yard effort in the 15th minute.</p>
      <p>Six minutes later, the Tottenham striker then curled a right-footed shot narrowly wide from just inside the left-hand edge of the penalty area.</p>

      <p>After Everton striker <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/richarlison/"><b>Richarlison</b></a> was denied by Jo Hyeon-woo just before the half-hour, the South Korea goalkeeper could then do nothing about Brazil's second in the 36th minute.</p>
      <p>Hwang Eui-jo's scything challenge on <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/fabinho/"><b>Fabinho</b></a> allowed Coutinho to deliver a touch of Samba-style brilliance as he fired a breathtaking 20-yard free-kick into the top-right corner, the 17th goal for his country.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/paulo-bento/"><b>Paulo Bento</b></a>'s side then came within inches of pulling one level before the break when a powerful long-range free-kick from Jung Woo-young took a slight deflection off the wall.</p>
      <p>The ball struck Alisson on the chest, forcing a scrambled clearance from Coutinho, whose first attempt with his left foot struck the post, fortuitously rebounding to him for a second effort he hacked away with his right.</p>

      <p>After Paqueta headed a yard over from a left-wing Coutinho free-kick in the 55th minute, Brazil made it 3-0 on the hour.</p>
      <p>A hopeful low ball through the area from Lodi managed to evade a host of Korean players and fell to Danilo, who unleashed a rocket of a right-footed drive from just outside the area that Jo could only palm into the roof of his net to give the right-back his first goal for his country.</p>
      <p>Further chances followed for Richarlison and Manchester City's <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/gabriel-jesus/"><b>Gabriel Jesus</b></a>, before Alisson palmed away two fizzing 25-yarders from Kim Jin-su and Son to leave South Korea without a goal in their last three matches.</p>
