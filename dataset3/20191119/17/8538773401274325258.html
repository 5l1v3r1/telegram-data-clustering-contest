      <p>The Patriots <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/story/_/id/27662788/brown-pats-cut-wr-amid-field-allegations">released Brown</a> on Sept. 20, just 11 days after signing him. Two days later, Brown called out Kraft and <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/pit/pittsburgh-steelers">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> quarterback <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/5536/ben-roethlisberger">Ben Roethlisberger</a>, comparing their legal issues with his own.</p>
      <p>Brown referred to Kraft's ongoing case in Florida, in which he was charged with solicitation for allegedly receiving a sex act at a massage parlor, and Roethlisberger's four-game suspension in 2010 for violating the NFL's personal conduct policy based on a sexual assault accusation.</p>
      <p>"Kraft got caught in the parlor AB speculations fired different strokes different folks clearly," Brown said in a now-deleted tweet.</p>
      <p>Brown's apology Tuesday comes five days after he <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/story/_/id/28086474/source-antonio-brown-meeting-nfl-lasted-8-hours">met with the NFL</a> to address sexual assault allegations against him. That meeting lasted about eight hours, and there could be follow-ups before a decision is made about his future, a source told ESPN's Josina Anderson.</p>
      <p>Brown has filed eight grievances against the <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nfl/team/_/name/oak/oakland-raiders">Oakland Raiders</a> and Patriots, a source told ESPN's Dan Graziano. He is seeking $39.775 million in lost salary, bonuses and guaranteed money.</p>
