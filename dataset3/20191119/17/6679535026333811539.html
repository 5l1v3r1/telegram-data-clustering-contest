      <h2>Two private airliners are expected to announce their operations from Coimbatore</h2>

      <p>The industry here is hopeful that the city will soon get better international flight connectivity, especially to west Asian countries.</p>
      <p>R. Varadarajan, chairman of Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Coimbatore, told presspersons here on Tuesday that two private airliners were expected to improve flight connectivity from Coimbatore to international destinations. “We hope the official announcements will be made soon,” he said.</p>
      <p>The travellers from Coimbatore airport need to take a domestic flight to New Delhi, Mumbai, or Chennai or travel to Kochi and take an international flight from there. Thus, they spent more time and money for an international travel.</p>
      <p>Unlike travellers out of Trichy, most of them in Coimbatore were from the manufacturing sector. So they needed better connectivity to the US and Europe and not as much to the south east Asian countries.</p>
      <p>Jet Airways had tie-ups with other airliners and travellers from Coimbatore were able to take flights from here to international destinations by booking on Jet. Now that Jet operations were not there, there was potential for other airliners to fill the gap, especially on the routes that Jet operated.</p>
      <p>Further, Coimbatore airport provided tax concessions to flights that land here at night.</p>
      <p>This was also an attraction to airliners to look at Coimbatore, he said.</p>
      <p>On airport expansion, Mr. Varadarajan said efforts for land acquisition were on. If all went well, the airport should be expanded in three years or so.</p>
      <p>An Airports Authority of India official said there were no immediate plans for more international connectivity from Coimbatore.</p>
      <p>However, when the private airliners got more aircraft that some of them had announced about, there was a possibility that they would look at Coimbatore.</p>
      <p>For the last one year, Coimbatore airport offered reduction in GST for aircraft that landed here after 11 p.m. and took off before 7 a.m. It would benefit domestic flights. The aim was to shift engine operations from the bigger airports.</p>
      <p>“Domestic airliners plan to add flights. The tax concession is expected to make them look at Coimbatore. Maybe in six months, Coimbatore will see more flight connectivity,” the official said.</p>
