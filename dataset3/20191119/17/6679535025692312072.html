      <p>A meeting of the District Legal Services Authority (DLSA) convened by its chairman A. Badharudeen, who is also the District and Session Judge, Alappuzha, on Tuesday asked six municipalities in the district to expedite steps to set up Faecal Sludge Treatment Plants (FSTPs) and Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs) for scientific treatment of waste generated in their respective limits.</p>
      <p>It observed that construction of treatment plants should not be delayed any further.</p>
      <p>The meeting directed respective civic bodies to take concrete steps and report progress being made in 30 days.</p>
      <p>As per orders of the Supreme Court and National Green Tribunal (NGT), it is mandatory for municipalities to construct FSTP and STP.</p>
      <p>Officials said that water contamination had reached alarming levels in the district. The presence of high levels of coliform bacteria was even found in drinking water sources of the Kerala Water Authority (KWA).</p>
      <p>The total coliform count in water collected from Thycattussery was 9,000/ 100 ml, whereas faecal coliform stood at 5,500 in September 2019.</p>
      <p>As per a recent study carried out by the Alappuzha unit of the KSPCB, private tanker lorries are discharging a whopping 25 lakh litres of waste water on a daily basis in different parts of the district, including in waterbodies, in the absence of proper septage waste management systems in place.</p>

      <p>Biju. B, Environmental Engineer, Kerala State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB), said that the meeting had taken a serious note of high levels of faecal contamination in waterbodies, including drinking water sources in the district. “It has asked the municipalities to immediately identify land and construct FSTPs.
