      <h1>Probe sought into death of dispensary employee</h1>
      <h2>CPI(M) alleges Cong.-BJP conspiracy</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T17:51:23+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 17:51</time> by <a rel="author">Staff Reporter</a></address>
      <p>The Communist Party of India (Marxist) has demanded a detailed probe into the death of a temporary staff at a government Ayurvedic dispensary in Karthikappally.</p>
      <p>Addressing a press conference here on Tuesday, CPI(M) Karthikappally area committee office-bearers alleged Congress-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) conspiracy behind the death.</p>
      <h3>Harassment</h3>
      <p>The woman, identified as Aruna, 32, allegedly ended her life on Saturday after facing mental harassment at the hands of a few panchayat members in connection with an inspection of medicine stock at the dispensary.</p>
      <p>The panchayat members and local body authorities inspected the dispensary following allegations of misappropriation of medicines.</p>
      <p>The panchayat team allegedly found medicine bottles filled with water.</p>
      <p>The CPI(M) leaders said both the Congress and BJP had tried to oust Aruna from the dispensary.</p>
      <p>“She was a member of a family associated with the CPI(M). A day before her death, several cartons were brought to the hospital. She was on leave that day. As planned, some people created a ruckus at the hospital on Saturday morning demanding an inspection to ascertain the medicine stock. Following this, the inspection team arrived and opened the boxes brought to the hospital a day before. They then carried out a public trial and harassed her. It was also broadcast live on social media. Congress and BJP members responsible for her death should be booked immediately,” the CPI(M) leaders said.</p>
      <h3>Rebuke</h3>
      <p>The relatives of the woman had earlier alleged that the panchayat authorities rebuked her following the inspection, prompting her to take the extreme step.</p>
      <p>Following her death, the Thrikkunnapuzha police have registered a case under Section 174 (police to inquire and report on suicide, etc.) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.PC).</p>
      <p>A note left behind by the deceased was recovered and its authenticity is being examined, said a police officer.</p>
      <p>CPI(M) leaders V.K. Sahadevan, M. Surendran, N. Sajeevan and others were present at the press meet.</p>
