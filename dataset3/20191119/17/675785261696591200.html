      <h2>Mum-of-one Jodie Lee claims she was not given a bed because staff at the Royal Liverpool Hospital said her issues were "mental, not physical" and described her ordeal as "traumatic"</h2>

      <p>A patient claims she was left having seizures for up to an hour on a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/nhs">NHS</a> hospital floor after staff repeatedly refused to give her a bed.</p>
      <p>Jodie Lee, from Liverpool, was rushed to A&amp;E at the Royal Liverpool Hospital on Friday evening with her brother and mum.</p>
      <p>She claims staff repeatedly refused to provide a hospital bed for her because her issues were 'mental, not physical.'</p>
      <p>The mum-of-one described her experience at the hospital as "a traumatic ordeal" that has left her feeling "disgusted".</p>
      <p>Jodie has shared her story to highlight how those with complex mental issues are falling through the cracks of the health service.</p>
      <p>The 36-year-old suffers from non-epileptic attack disorder, functional neurological disorder and also has alopecia, the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/mum-left-lying-ae-floor-17268650">Liverpool Echo reports</a> .</p>

      <p>During the incident, Jodie says she was forced to use a blanket from an ambulance as a pillow, further upsetting her family who were with her at the time.</p>
      <p>Liverpool University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust which runs the hospital said that "Ms Lee was cared for appropriately".</p>
      <p>Staff were in the process of making arrangements to make her more comfortable while she waited for an assessment, a hospital spokesperson added.</p>
      <p>Jodie claims that after an examination A&amp;E staff said that she was not eligible for a bed - all because her seizures were "stress and mental health related."</p>
      <p>Jodie suffers from non-epileptic attack disorder (NEAD), a condition that produces seizures.</p>
      <p>She says that while she was fitting she was declared medically fit and told by staff that she would not be offered a bed.</p>
      <p>It's claimed that one seizure she experienced while at the hospital caused her to fall to the ground and hit her head on the floor.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>She says she was left convulsing on the floor for over an hour - despite staff repeatedly saying she was 'medically fit'.</p>
      <p>Jodie says that when members of her family repeatedly asked nurses for a bed for Jodie she was told to make do with a chair.</p>
      <p>Her brother, Josh Lee, 29, said staff at A&amp;E at the Royal that night showed "no duty of care at all" towards his sister.</p>
      <p>The family say they left A&amp;E at around 9pm three hours after being transported to the hospital by ambulance.</p>
      <p>Then at around 10.30pm they say they received a call from the hospital asking her whereabouts.</p>
      <p>Jodie described her experience at the hospital as 'a traumatic ordeal' that has left her feeling 'disgusted'.</p>
      <p>She said: “When I arrived they took me straight through to a quiet room because I was making a lot of noise because I suffer from Tourette's when I'm in one of my seizures.</p>
      <p>"I was hitting myself as part of my seizure. It's completely involuntary.</p>
      <p>“They left me with no bed knowing full well that I have seizures and I should have been placed on a bed like everyone else deserves a bed in the Royal.</p>
      <p>"I think because I had been seen by the crisis mental health team I wasn't technically under A&amp;E and they said I didn't require a bed.</p>

      <p>“But then I stood up and had another seizure that caused me to hit my head on the floor. After I had the next seizure and hit my head on the floor I needed a bed."</p>
      <p>Jodie and her family claim that she was then left convulsing on the floor for more than an hour, and was repeatedly told she was 'medically fit'.</p>
      <p>She said: "After I fell and hit my head, the nurses came over and took my <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/health/ten-ways-banish-high-blood-9621402">blood pressure</a> and heart rate and then they just walked out again.</p>
      <p>“I was having seizures on the floor with just my pyjamas on. I was freezing. I had the blanket that they gave me as a pillow to put under my head in case I had another seizure and they still wouldn’t give me a bed.</p>
      <p>"You always think going to hospital is the safest place for you but I feel like I should have stayed at home. But instead I've gone through that awful traumatic ordeal.</p>
      <p>"I feel absolutely disgusted. Everyone who enters the hospital should be entitled to a bed if they need it.</p>
      <p>"If you're in hospital it's meant to be a safe environment, you're meant to be safe.</p>
      <p>"Being on the floor of the Royal and having seizures is not safe at all."</p>
      <p>Jodie's brother, Josh Lee, 29, said that the experience left her with 'no dignity at all'.</p>
      <p>He said: "The picture of her laying on the floor says it all.</p>

      <p>"She didn't get the care that she needed. She was deemed medically fit and had to just lay on the floor. It's was wrong on so many levels.</p>
      <p>“The nurses kept saying that she had been deemed medically fit and that she doesn’t need a bed. That’s when my mum said, 'What is she going to do? Lay on the floor?' </p>
      <p>“We were told: ‘she’s got a chair hasn’t she?'</p>
      <p>"I felt that there was no duty of care towards her at all that night."</p>
      <p>Josh said that he and his mother eventually decided to leave the hospital before Jodie was discharged from A&amp;E.</p>
      <p>He said: “No-one discharged her in the end we just ended up leaving the hospital because she was just left laying there on the floor. We got our bags and coats and went home.</p>
      <p>"We could see at least three empty beds when we left. Nobody asked where we were going."</p>
      <p>Jodie, a former carer who has a nine-year-old son and is unable to work as a result of her condition.</p>
      <p>She relies on care from her mum and carers for round-the-clock supervision.</p>
      <p>She says that since she was diagnosed with FND two and a half years ago, her quality of life has deteriorated and that the seizures are "ruining" her life.</p>
      <p>She said: “I’ve been going through hell for the last two and a half years. My son’s had to deal with it and he’s only nine. He’s grown up as a young carer. It’s not fair on him.</p>
      <p>“It’s taking my life away. I can’t even be left alone.</p>
      <p>"My mum went to the shops the other day and she came back and I was absolutely torturing myself. There’s no light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
      <p>"I’ve been told I have to wait for two years to see a consultant about my condition and it’s just horrible. This is going to be my life for two years. How am I meant to cope?"</p>
      <p>Her brother Josh, who works as a chef, said: "It's heartbreaking watching her like this and when she says she's got no life.</p>
      <p>"Sometimes when I come round to visit she'll just be lying on the floor fitting and she'd have her head on my mum's knee.</p>
      <p>"Watching her suffer like this is horrible. It's on a daily basis now."</p>
      <p>In a statement, Dr Tristan Cope, Medical Director at the Royal Liverpool Hospital, said: "The priority of our staff is to always provide the best care possible for patients and our team treat patients' emergency medical needs.</p>
      <p>"Whilst Ms Lee and family members were in the department, Ms Lee was cared for appropriately by our team.</p>
      <p>"Staff were making arrangements to make her more comfortable whilst she waited for an assessment for her health needs from another specialist team.</p>
      <p>"However Ms Lee and her family left the department before either of these could be facilitated.</p>
      <p>"We would like the opportunity to discuss the experience that Ms Lee described with her and encourage her to contact our Patient Advice and Complaints Team so that we can look into this in the most appropriate way."</p>
