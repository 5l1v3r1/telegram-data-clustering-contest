      <p>**<i>Warning – contains spoilers for The Mandalorian and the Star Wars Universe as a whole**</i></p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/the-mandalorian/">The Mandalorian</a> has already shocked viewers <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/the-mandalorian-episode-2-finally-reveals-significance-of-mind-blowing-twist-11165134/">with a game-changing twist in its first episode</a>.</p>
      <p>But the reveal of the character that we will call – for now – The Asset has some pretty long-lasting implications, not just for the TV series itself, but the entire <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/star-wars/">Star Wars</a> Universe as a whole.</p>
      <p>Come and take a deep-dive with us through every hint the show has dropped so far including what is is, where it comes and, most importantly – how it could tie into events for the upcoming Rise of Skywalker film.</p>
      <h4>Who is ‘The Asset’?</h4>

      <p>To put it quite simply: Yoda. Well, technically <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/mandalorian-introduces-baby-yoda-star-wars-fans-obviously-internet-cannot-handle-11089019/">Baby Yoda</a>.</p>
      <p>Well, technically a baby that <i>looks</i> like Yoda but maybe isn’t. Basically, the identity of this character is just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>There are a handful of theories as to what The Asset actually is.</p>
      <p>The Mandalorian takes place after the events of Return of the Jedi, so Yoda as we know him is already dead. But The Force, as we know, works in very mysterious ways, so this could easily be the re-incarnation or re-birth of Yoda.</p>
      <p>The other (more simple) answer is that The Asset is <i>not</i> Baby Yoda – but a member of the same species. Which is itself interesting, since we’ve never seen another member of this species before.</p>
      <h4>Where does The Mandalorian fit in?</h4>

        <figcaption>The Mandalorian is on a mission, quite literally (Picture: Disney)</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The basic premise of The Mandalorian was that the series would follow <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/game-of-thrones/">Game of Thrones</a>’ Pedro Pascal’s titular bounty hunter in his adventures around the galaxy.</p>
      <p>We now know that was a little bit of a white lie, and while we <i>are</i> following his adventures, his actual mission was to acquire The Asset for a man known only as The Client (played, bizarrely, by noted auteur filmmaker Werner Herzog!)</p>
      <p>The Client has his own battalion of Stormtroopers to hand, so it’s pretty safe to assume he has allegiances to the now-crumbling Empire. But what does he want with The Asset?</p>
      <p>Well, we don’t know that either – but we bet it won’t be good.</p>
      <h4>How does Attack of the Clones fit in?</h4>
      <p>Yes, you read that correctly. Not many people may have expected it, but the often-overlooked second Star Wars prequel has now become a necessary touchstone for fans trying to work out the meanings behind The Mandalorian.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>One such theory takes the Clone Army from Episode II and runs with it, there’s even the tiniest throwback in the show to the insignia of Kamino, the planet responsible for creating the Clone Army that ravaged the galaxy and paved the way for the Empire.</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/FilmEasterEggs/status/1196602252699455488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>
      </figure>
      <p>Basically, this theory deposits that Dr Purshing from the show was wearing the Kamino badge on his uniform, signifying that he was involved (or at least as knowledge) of cloning.</p>
      <p>So, The Asset is not Yoda…not really, just a clone of him.</p>
      <h4>What does this mean for Rise of Skywalker?</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i0.wp.com/metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/ay116086723editorial-use-on-e1376307870955.jpg?quality=90&amp;strip=all&amp;zoom=1&amp;resize=540%2C524&amp;ssl=1"/>

      </figure>
      <p>We’re glad you ask! If the revelation that The Asset is in fact a clone of the green Jedi master, we think this will have major ramifications for the next Star Wars film, especially where a certain Sith Lord is concerned.</p>
      <p>If trailers (and that iconic laugh!) are anything to go by, everybody’s favourite dictator Emperor Palpatine <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/04/12/star-wars-fans-freak-out-as-they-recognise-iconic-laugh-in-the-rise-of-skywalker-trailer-9194451/">will be making his evil return in Rise of Skywalker</a>, despite having been murdered by his protege Darth Vade in Return of the Jedi.</p>
      <p>Although, if cloning Yoda proves to be easy enough – why not the leader of the Empire himself?</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>There is also a precedent for Palpatine surviving his apparent death in the wider Star Wars Universe, including the comic Star Wars: Dark Empire, although its canon status has been stripped thanks to Disney’s merger with Lucasfilm.</p>
      <p>Basically, the comic imagines that Palpatine managed to survive being thrown from the balcony by cloning himself; managing to make hundreds of thousands of copy-Emperors, hiding out in a deserted star system and plotting to make his return and re-establish the Empire.</p>
      <p>Handily. The Mandalorian’s finale will air right before the release of Rise to Skywalker, meaning if The Asset were revealed to be a clone, viewers have a handy clue going into the new film.</p>
      <p>There’s a lot to un-pack here, and there’s undoubtedly more to come as we wait for the third episode’s arrival, so keep your eyes peeled as we discover all the hidden secrets of The Mandalorian together. May the Force be with us!</p>
