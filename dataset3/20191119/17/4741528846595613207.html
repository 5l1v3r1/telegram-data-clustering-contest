      <p><b>Six aviation bills</b> have been forwarded to the Senate for consideration and passage into law by President Muhammadu Buhari, according to <a href="https://tribuneonlineng.com/aviation-buhari-seeks-passage-of-6-bills-by-senate-2/">Nigerian Tribune</a>.</p>
      <p><b>The Details</b>: The six bills include Civil Aviation Bill 2019, Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria Bill 2019, Nigerian College of Air Space Management Agency Establishment Bill 2019.</p>
      <p>Others are Nigerian College of Aviation Technology Establishment Bill 2019, Nigerian Meteorological Agency Establishment Bill 2019, and Nigerian Safety Investigation Bureau Establishment Bill 2019.</p>

      <p><b>The request was contained</b> in a letter addressed to the Nigerian Senate and read by Senate President, Dr Ahmad Lawan at a plenary session.</p>
      <p>The letter read: <i>“Dear Distinguished Senate President,</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“Transmission of Six Aviation Sector Bills to the National Assembly for consideration and passage into law.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Pursuant to Section 58 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 as amended, I formally request that the following six bills be considered for passage by the Senate.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>“While I trust that these bills will be expeditiously and favourably considered by the Senate, please, accept Mr Senate President the assurances of my highest consideration</i>.”</p>

      </p>
      <p><b>To hasten the process</b>, Lawan directed the Clerk to the Senate, Nelson Ayewoh to ensure that the bills were gazetted and distributed to all the Senators for consideration.</p>
      <p><b>Why this matters</b>: Nigeria has experienced the <a href="http://www.gosodipo.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/AVIATION-LAW-NEWSLETTER.pdf">absence</a> of enabling laws to provide a safety net for professionals in the aviation sector which is a critical situation for aviation professionals in Nigeria. This could be the reason for the President’s immediate request for passing the bills to the Nigerian Senate for consideration.</p>
      <p><b>What you should know</b>: The primary <a href="https://gettingthedealthrough.com/area/1/jurisdiction/18/air-transport-nigeria/">legislation</a> regulating aviation in Nigeria is the CAA. Section 77(2) of the CAA provides that all regulations, by-laws, orders and subsidiary legislation made under the old Civil Aviation Act of 1964 shall continue to be in force until new regulations, by-laws, orders and subsidiary legislations are made pursuant to the CAA of 2006.</p>
      <p><b>This is why Managing Director</b>, Med-View Airline, Alhaji Muneer Bankole, called on the Aviation Minister, Hadi Sirika to implement <a href="https://nairametrics.com/2019/09/15/med-view-boss-calls-for-aviation-reforms/">certain reforms</a> needed in the Nigerian aviation industry as reported by Nairametrics.</p>
