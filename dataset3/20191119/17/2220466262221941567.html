      <p>Despite all the negative superlatives currently being hurled by the Lebanese themselves at the current affairs of the Lebanese state it is arguable that exactly one hundred years ago Lebanon actually did offer the world the best model those days for religious tolerance and coexistence. And as the Lebanese experiment faltered in the latter half of the twentieth century, that challenge of religious coexistence continued to be the holy grail or worldwide dream of the 21st century. Lebanon early on after the World Wars of the 20th century certainly did better than other monolithic religious states or theocracies in the region. But then the Lebanese succumbed in 1975-1990 to the temptation of destroying their own experiment. Today perhaps like the phoenix, the symbol of Lebanon and the namesake of a prior more peaceful people and better era, Lebanon may be on the path again to breaking ground, or ceiling, or both, in this miserable region. It may be upgrading its model of 1920 into a model 2020. Thus this 2019 revolution may well be on its way to become a truest and most historic revolution. There are two faces or two major components in this new model.One is the courageous evolution of its politics. In its own unique though may be warped way, sectarian politics that is now vilified did allow freedom of expression to thrive more than any other Middle Eastern country, and it delivered short term prosperity like no other in the neighborhood, and it gave the people of the various communities some sense of justice that helped minimize marginalization. But this sectarian politics proved futile in many ways and was eventually unable to propel progress on citizenship, comprehensive justice and institutional development. Actually it first led to a civil war which in turn solidified further the sectarian divides as one of the unintended consequences of the Taef accord, and allowed sectarianism to infiltrate further into government causing disastrous gridlock and consecrating the ideology of money. The not infrequent corruption of capitalism became actually a practice of carnivorous and criminal pre-capitalism. The more youthful Lebanese became convinced of the virtues and the needs for a citizenry that transcends sects and focuses on what unites us much more than on what divides us. The latter, that is sectarianism, suddenly in 2019 took a backseat to a rising authentic national spirit, and turned the priority list on its head placing development and justice on top. The second face, or it could be even called weapon, of this revolution is the enlisting of women not just in a supportive role like most wars of hate and other wars of independence, but in a leading constructive role of development, dignity and a better future for the children. This was a brilliant development unseen before and unmatched in its novelty especially in the Middle East but also in its effectiveness and its inspirational power. As a physician I can only vouch with total conviction and decades of experience that when it comes to an ailment that befalls a member of a family it is almost always the woman who makes all the difference in bringing to bear all the forces necessary to orchestrate the mechanics of the various parts of the healing process and take it to fruition. I’ve always noted that in all walks of life women were goal oriented while men tend to be more game oriented. Whenever a woman was involved in the illness of a family member, be it as a wife, a sister, a daughter or a mother, she seemed to take charge better and command the respect and leadership necessary to carry the project to its best conclusion. And the ill person seemed always to respond and recover faster. I could only think of that as I saw those brave, articulate and indomitable Lebanese women on the streets and on the television screens firmly and constructively take over the front rows of the Revolution. As a minimum the possible use of force against them was harder to imagine and execute. But there’s a lot more here. There is something magical in the animal and human kingdoms about a woman sacrificing all to protect her children and her siblings. Doubts seem to erase faster, paths and goals seem to clarify better and courage of men is doubled from their depths. In summary after the collapse of the dilapidated Ottoman Empire in 1920 Lebanon gave the world a new model in diversity coexisting in the same country in a semi democracy of sects that eventually needed an upgrade (as vicious neighbors utilized its land as a battleground). Exactly a hundred years later Lebanon may be finally upgrading its model : basically jumping over what divides them as sects into what unites them as citizens. And this time the numbers and power are more than doubled by the amazing co-leadership of their women. What rests on the shoulders of these brave youths is truly of historic proportions. No one can afford that they lose. And it does not look like they will. On to Lebanon 2.0.-----------<i>Dr. Jack Tohme is an endocrinologist in the New York area and is affiliated with Columbia University and the Valley Hospital in New Jersey.
