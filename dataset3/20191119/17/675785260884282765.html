      <h2>The 57-year-old man is thought to have died of hypothermia while trying to sleep rough in a tent in Wakefield, North Yorkshire as temperatures dropped overnight</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T17:37:43+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 17:37</time> by <a rel="author">Kelly-Ann Mills, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>A homeless man was found frozen to death after temperatures plummeted across the country last night claiming four lives in just 12 hours.</p>
      <p>The dad was reportedly found dead in a flimsy tent he had been sleeping in close to Wakefield Cathedral.</p>
      <p>His death comes after another man, who also believed to have died sleeping rough, was found collapsed in an alleyway behind a Hilton Hotel in Nottingham.</p>
      <p>And in separate incidents, an unknown male and a teenager, were killed after being struck by lorries during foggy conditions.</p>
      <p>In Wakefield temperatures hovered around -3 degrees on Tuesday night but in Braemar in Aberdeenshire they fell to -9.0 overnight making it the coldest night of autumn.</p>
      <p>Below freezing temperatures are expected again tonight, as cold as -3C in parts of Scotland.</p>
      <p>This evening, there will be cloud and patchy rain for western parts of England, Wales and Scotland. </p>

      <p>The 57 year old, had been sleeping rough, moving from city to city in the North of England until settling in Wakefield, West Yorkshire.</p>
      <p>Originally from Lithuania his friends said he was a popular man.</p>
      <p>"A lot of local people knew him," said friend and fellow rough sleeper David Flowers, 47, said.</p>
      <p>“He has been found in his tent and he’s thought to have died from hypothermia.”</p>

      <p>Mr Flowers said the man had grown up children and parents back in Lithuania, where he had served in the army.</p>
      <p>“He was a really, really good man and never did anything bad to anybody,” said Mr Flowers, wiping away tears.</p>
      <p>“He didn’t claim any benefits, he did odd jobs and begged for money.</p>
      <p>“It is really sad that.”</p>
      <p>Mr Flowers would see the dad on a daily basis and spent time with him yesterday afternoon.</p>

      <p>Police say they believe there are no suspicious circumstances surrounding the death.</p>
