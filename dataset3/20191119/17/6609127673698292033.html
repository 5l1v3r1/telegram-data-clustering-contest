      <p>We told earlier how Sunday was recorded as the <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4966974/scottish-weather-forecast-met-office-cold-freezing/">coldest night of the year so far</a> - with temperatures plummeting to -8.6C in some parts of the country.</p>
      <p>Emergency services rushed to the scene after Jamie was discovered unwell.</p>
      <p>He was rushed to Glasgow Royal Infirmary but was sadly pronounced dead after arrival.</p>
      <p>Cops say the death is not being treated as suspicious.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for the force said: "Around 5.50pm on Sunday 17 November 2019, police were called to a report of a man unwell within a car park in Mitchell Lane, Glasgow.</p>
      <p>"The 43 year-old man was taken to Glasgow Royal Infirmary, where he was pronounced dead.</p>

      <p>"A post mortem examination will take place in due course, however at this time the death is not being treated as suspicious."</p>
      <p>Initial reports suggested the man who died was homeless.</p>
      <p>But a spokeswoman for Glasgow’s Health &amp; Social Care Partnership said: “Homelessness services have not been officially notified of the death of anyone they have been working with.</p>
      <p>“We await formal identification of the deceased and, of course, will fully assist the police and emergency services in their investigation.”</p>
      <p>Anyone with concerns about a rough sleeper or homeless person is asked to contact the council's RSVP service on 0800 027 7466.</p>
      <p>We told earlier how a <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4966453/aberdeen-diamond-bridge-death-police/">man died in Aberdeen</a> as police locked down Diamond Bridge in the city.</p>
      <p>Officers raced to the bridge in the north of the city at around 7.40am where a man was found dead.</p>
      <p>And a police probe has been launched after a man's <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4966555/aberdeenshire-turriff-body-found-burn-police/">body was found at an Aberdeenshire burn.</a></p>
      <p>The tragic discovery was made near Haughs park in Turriff at around 9am on Sunday morning.</p>
      <p>The area was cordoned off as an investigation got under way.</p>
      <p>Cops are now investigating the death which is currently being treated as unexplained.</p>
