      <p>PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — A jury has decided that an Oregon helicopter company must pay $14.6 million to the families of two California men who plummeted to their deaths when a nylon rope suspending them from a helicopter in Louisiana broke.</p>
      <p>The Oregonian/OregonLive reports jurors found Winco Powerline Services of Aurora responsible for the multimillion-dollar verdict after 26-year-old Travis Chiokai and 27-year-old Nicholas Gamalski died Nov. 7, 2017.</p>
      <p>Winco Powerline Services transports workers and equipment for the powerline construction industry.</p>
      <p>Portland attorney John Coletti, who represented Gamalski’s estate, said the pilot rubbed the rope against an abrasive, braided metal line that serves as a lightning rod of sorts and that caused the rope holding the two men to sever.</p>
      <p>Coletti said the catastrophe could have been avoided if the pilot had used a rope covered in Kevlar.</p>
      <p>Winco Powerline Services didn’t dispute it was at fault. It asked a jury to decide how much in damages it was responsible for.</p>
