      <p>Yuvraj had termed KKR's decision to release Lynn a "bad call" and joked that he might send a message the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ipl">Indian Premier League</a> (IPL) team's co-owner <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Shah-Rukh-Khan">Shah Rukh Khan</a> regarding that.</p>
      <p>Lynn smashed 91 off 30 balls while playing for the Maratha Arabians in the Abu Dhabi <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/T10-league">T10 league</a>. It is a new record for the highest individual score in T10 <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket">cricket</a>. The previous record was held by England's <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/alex-hales">Alex Hales</a> (87 off 32 balls).</p>
      <p>"Chris (Lynn) was outstanding today, unbelievable hits," Yuvraj, who also plays for the Maratha Arabians, said after the game.</p>
      <p>"He is someone I have seen in the IPL. He has given some great starts to KKR. I really don't understand why they have not retained him. I think it is a bad call, must send SRK a message on that. Chris was just outstanding today," he added.</p>
      <p>Lynn though does not hold any hard feelings for KKR, after he was among the 13 players released by KKR ahead of the auction on December 19 in Kolkata.</p>
