      <p>JERUSALEM — The Latest on the situation in the Mideast following latest Israeli airstrikes in Syria (all times local):</p>
      <p>7:55 a.m.</p>
      <p>Syrian state media say two civilians have been killed and several others wounded in a series of Israeli airstrikes near the capital, Damascus.</p>
      <p>The state SANA news agency is reporting that Syrian air defences destroyed most of the missiles before they reached their targets in Wednesday’s attack.</p>
      <p>The report adds that however, two people were killed by shrapnel from an Israeli missile that hit a house in the town of Saasaa, southwest of Damascus.</p>
      <p>SANA says the house was destroyed.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>5:55 a.m.</p>
      <p>The Israeli military says it has carried out a “wide-scale” strike on Iranian targets in Syria following a rocket attack on the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights the previous day.</p>
      <p>In a statement early Wednesday, the military says fighter jets struck dozens of targets, including surface-to-air missiles, weapons warehouses and military bases.</p>
      <p>The military said it also struck positions of the Syrian army after a Syrian air defence missile was fired.</p>
      <p>Israel said the rocket attack on the Golan Heights was “further clear proof of the purpose of Iranian entrenchment in Syria.”</p>
