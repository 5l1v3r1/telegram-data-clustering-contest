      <h1>Faraday Future Reveals Lavishly High-Tech FF 91 Interior</h1>
      <h2>It has 11 screens.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T17:08:48+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 17:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.motor1.com/info/team/anthony-alaniz/" target="_blank">Anthony Alaniz</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.motor1.com/tag/ff91/">Faraday Future FF 91</a> debuted nearly <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/132637/faraday-future-ff91-debut-ces/">three years ago to a ton of fanfare</a> – and a <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/132691/faraday-future-ff-91-failure/">bit of embarrassment</a>. The FF 91 has yet to enter production with a ton of drama happening behind the scenes. But <a href="https://www.motor1.com/tag/faraday-future/">Faraday Future</a> isn’t throwing in the towel yet. The company released new images of the interior, calling it the “third internet living space,” along with a host of new details should the EV ever enter production. </p>
      <p>Large screens dominate the dashboard with a tablet-like infotainment display in the center and another screen in the dash for the passenger. Another screen sits high on the dash in front of the steering wheel, integrating the instrument cluster information. Faraday also integrates screens into the doors that house the controls for seat setting, climate control, individual sound zones, and more.</p>

      <p>The rear treats passengers to even more luxury with the zero-gravity seats. Faraday claims they offer “industry-leading” 60-degree rear-seat reclining angles. The massaging heated and cooled seats also offer lower leg, lumbar, and upper back adjustments. Each seat is 14-way adjustable with 4-way lumbar support. There’s also a “Spa Mode” that can change the lighting and audio.  </p>
      <p>Faraday can’t have its “third internet living space” without the internet, so Faraday is packing three modems into the vehicle. One is dedicated to vehicle diagnostics and over-the-air updates while the other two focus on handling data for in-vehicle connectivity and entertainment, including streaming video while on the go. There’s a 27-inch ultra-wide screen that flips down from the roof, too. </p>

      <p>Faraday is also integrating FFAI, an artificial intelligence that uses the car’s sensors, cameras, and software – more than three years in development – to create a custom user experience. The system can use facial recognition, voice recognition, and the person’s weight to tailor individual seat settings, including setting the right temperature and sound volume level. </p>
      <p>Faraday boasts that there are at least 11 different screens inside the FF 91, which seems like a lot. But automakers are quickly abandoning knobs, buttons, and switches, for the versatility of a screen. If the FF 91 enters production, it could change the way automakers think of interiors going forward. But that’s a big <i>if</i>. It certainly looks ready for production.</p>

        </p>
        <p>
          <i>The Smart phone was introduced first back in 2007 and changed everyone’s digital life on the go. The Smart TV was introduced first in 2013 and changed the way we access digital contents at home. Faraday Future’s mission is to change the concept of digital life when we are in our vehicles.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>FF 91 introduces the “third internet living space,” the conduit between one’s home and destination (office, school etc.).</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>“We are now living an increasingly busy lifestyle, and we demand to be continuously connected anytime and anywhere. As we typically travel between home and our destinations every day, the car provides a safe and comfortable means of transportation, however, the time in transit is often considered “down” time. FF is here to change that,” said Carsten Breitfeld, CEO of Faraday Future. “Our goal is to make your daily commute the highlight of your day through a rich digital experience and give you back more time in your day.”</i>

The rear seats deliver industry-leading 60-degree rear-seat reclining angles, putting passengers in the biomechanically and ergonomically optimal position for comfort. This first-class rear seating experience provides lower leg, lumbar, and upper back adjustments and support. The seats also offer massage, heating, and ventilation for cooling.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Like a private jet on 22-inch wheels, FF 91 is designed to ensconce its passengers in a relaxing, lounge-like experience, from departure to destination.  Every element of the interior contributes its small part to creating an experience rather than simply another ultra-luxury means of transporting passengers down the road.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>
            <b>Zero-Gravity Seats</b>
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>In the back of FF 91 are two Zero-Gravity Seats, taking principles learned from NASA’s space experiments and co-opting to create Neutral Body Posture, optimally distributing the user’s body weight to provide a more relaxing, rejuvenating experience. The rear chairs are each 14-way adjustable in addition to having 4-way adjustable lumbar support.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Further, they can recline up to 60<sup>◦</sup>, the greatest recline of any production vehicle, with full lower leg, back and lumbar adjustment.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Complementing the experience is FF 91’s “Spa Mode,” which, in addition to heated and ventilated chairs, adjusts ambient mood lighting and limo lighting, as well as visual and audio effects, helping soothe the soul. Rear chairs also feature integrated cushion massaging.</i>
