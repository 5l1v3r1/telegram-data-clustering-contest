      <p>Fox Searchlight’s ultra fun <a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/?s=Ready+or+not"><i><b>Ready or Not</b></i></a> (<a href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/reviews/3578944/review-youre-not-ready-wickedly-brilliant-ready-not/">read our review</a>) rolls its way to Digital HD <b>November 26th</b> and Blu-ray/DVD <b>December 3rd</b>.</p>
      <p>In the film, the sanctity of marriage goes straight to hell when a young bride (<b>Samara Weaving</b>) competes in a time-honored tradition with her new husband (<b>Mark O’Brien</b>) and his insanely rich and eccentric Le Domas family (<b>Adam Brody, Henry Czerny, </b>and<b> Andie MacDowell)</b>. The bride’s wedding night takes a turn for the worst when she realizes she is at the center of a lethal game of ‘Hide and Seek’ and must fight her not-so-loveable in-laws for her own survival.</p>
      <p>The in-home release is slaying with special features as writers <b>Guy Busick </b>and<b> R. Christopher Murphy</b> give insight on their script’s exploration of the Faustian bargain made by the Le Domas family. Directors <b>Matt Bettinelli-Olpin, Tyler Gillett</b> and Producer <b>Chad Villella</b> explain how they used practical effects to deliver an authentically bloody film.</p>
      <p>Bloody Disgusting has an exclusive look at one of the featurettes in which the filmmaking team share how the project came together and what made Radio Silence the right choice to helm this thrilling endeavor.</p>
