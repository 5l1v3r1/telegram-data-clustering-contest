      <h1>13 years on in music and nothing to boast of not even a car – Dada Hafco</h1>

      <p>While some Ghanaian musicians are feeling, others especially Dada Hafco is seriously bleeding as he can’t boast of anything for doing active music for the past 13 years.</p>
      <p>This is because Dada Hafco in an interview with blogger Zion Felix struggled to point out what he has been able to acquire with revenues earned from music. When the interviewer pressed further, the ‘<b>Yebe Wu Nti’</b> composer said he cannot boast of having a house or a car despite doing music for 13 solid years.</p>
      <p>In spite of all the difficulties, Dada Hafco was resolute not to change his style of music. To his best knowledge, things will definitely change for the better. For reasons best known to him, he posited in the interview that he’s ever grateful to Nana Ama McBrown and her husband.</p>
