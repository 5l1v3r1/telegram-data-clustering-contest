      <p>A <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/southwest/texas">Texas</a> mother and father were <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime">sentenced</a> Friday for their roles in dissolving the remains of their 2-year-old daughter in a tub of acid after the child's death.</p>
      <p>Monica Dominguez, 38, and her 32-year-old husband Gerardo Zavala Loredo were both arrested in February after police searched their apartment and found the remains of their daughter, Rebecka Zavala, in a five-gallon container hidden in a bedroom closet, the <a href="https://www.lmtonline.com/local/crime/article/Laredo-woman-found-guilty-of-dissolving-child-s-14842832.php#photo-16935873">Laredo Morning Times</a> reported.</p>

      <p>Both parents pleaded guilty Friday to tampering with evidence of a human corpse. Zavala Loredo took a plea deal and was sentenced to 14 years in prison.</p>
      <p>Dominguez additionally pleaded guilty to endangering a child and abuse of a corpse. She will serve a total of 20 years in prison.</p>
      <p>Her judgment will run consecutively with a 10-year revocation sentence for violating her probation in a prior child injury case in which her 9-month-old son suffered six bone fractures, according to the paper.</p>

      <p>Neither parent could be charged with murder because the state of Rebecka's remains prevented authorities from determining a cause of death, Zavala Loredo’s defense attorney Abundio Rene Cantu told <a href="https://www.kgns.tv/content/news/Mother-accused-of-dumping-childs-remains-in-acid-expected-to-enter-plea-564986212.html">KGNS-TV</a>.</p>
      <p>Dominguez had told investigators that Rebecka’s death was accidental, maintaining that the child had drowned in a bathtub when left unsupervised, authorities said. She said she asked her husband to help dispose of the body.</p>
