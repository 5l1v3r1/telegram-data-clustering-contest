      <p>A jockey who answered a last-minute plea on Twitter scored a big win after stopping for a McDonald’s on the way to her unscheduled ride.</p>
      <p>Racheal Kneller spotted a tweet on Tuesday morning from owner Vaughan Lewis, whose horse Ruacana was without a rider for the Flat Jockeys Can Jump Handicap Hurdle at Lingfield after booked jockey Trevor Whelan’s flight was cancelled.</p>

      <p>Kneller dashed to the Surrey course from Berkshire to take the ride on the Zoe Davison-trained 10-year-old – but not before stopping at McDonald’s for some pre-race fuel.</p>
      <p>It did the trick as she rode Ruacana, carrying a 7lb penalty for winning at the track a week ago, to a 10-length victory.</p>
      <p>“That was great fun. He jumped well. He was a schoolmaster – he met everything perfect and I was just a passenger. He was an absolute superstar,” Kneller told Sky Sports Racing.</p>

      <p>“I said I ought to go jumping – I had a McDonald’s on the way here and these weights are much better!”</p>
      <p>Jockeys carry more weight in races over hurdles than on the flat, allowing Kneller the unusual pre-race treat.</p>
      <p>The win was Kneller’s first success of 2019 – after 35 winless rides on the flat.</p>
      <p>“I had a chocolate milkshake on the way there and I’ll be having Champagne when I get home,” she told BBC Sport.</p>
