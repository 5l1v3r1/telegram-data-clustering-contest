      <h1>Over 100 killed in Iran protests, Amnesty International says</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T17:11:25+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 17:11</time> by <a rel="author">COMPILED FROM WIRE SERVICES</a></address>
      <p>At least 106 people have been killed in 21 cities across Iran during protests that broke out over fuel prices rises last week, Amnesty International said on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>"The organization believes that the real death toll may be much higher, with some reports suggesting as many as 200 have been killed," Amnesty said in a statement, citing "credible reports."</p>
      <p>Iran's government, which has not made nationwide numbers available for the toll of the unrest that began Sunday, did not immediately respond to the report.</p>
      <p>A hard-line newspaper in Iran is suggesting that those who led violent protests will be executed by hanging as the unrest continues.</p>
      <p>The article published Tuesday in the Keyhan newspaper cited reports, saying "that the judiciary considers execution by hanging for the riot leaders a definite punishment." It did not elaborate further.</p>
      <p>Since Sunday Iran has shut down the internet and deployed police and anti-riot forces to quell the unrest. Demonstrations are believed to still be going on across the country.</p>
      <p>It remains difficult to know the scale of the demonstrations. Iran shut down the internet on Saturday, stopping protesters from sharing information and their videos online.</p>
