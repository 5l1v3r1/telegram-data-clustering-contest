      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T17:53:35+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 17:53</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/dan-osborne">Dan Osborne</a> says this year's <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> campmates could end up feeling the wrath of his "hangry" wife Jacqueline Jossa.</p>
      <p>Dan says <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/jacqueline-jossa">Jacqueline</a> can get a little feisty when she hasn't eaten, so there's no telling what that diet of rice and beans will do to her.</p>
      <p>The former TOWIE and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/celebrity-big-brother">Celebrity</a><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/big-brother">Big Brother</a> star reckons his wife's campmates could see a very different side to her if she doesn't get a few decent meals.</p>
      <p>Speaking exclusively to Mirror Online, Dan, who shares daughters Ella, four, and Mia, one, with Jacqueline said she might struggle with some of the Bushtucker Trials.</p>
      <p>He told us: "I mean if it’s a spider then I know she will find that hard, she can’t even see one in the house without screaming!</p>

      <p>"But I think as it goes on and the hungrier the camp get I think she will try really hard. Although if she hasn’t eaten much she does get hangry so watch out campmates! But she will give it her all whatever!"</p>
      <p>Dan chatted about Jacqueline's time in the jungle as he teamed up with brand Forever Sewing to launch their new personalised dressing gowns in time for Christmas.</p>
      <p>The reality star, 28, posed up in matching cosy dressing gowns with his son Teddy, five, as Jacqueline settled down to life in Snake Rock.</p>
      <p>Dan said: "I’m really proud of Jac going into the jungle – I really think she has already shown that she is up for anything. And the fact that she’s been in Snake Rock first will prepare her for main camp, because let's face it, if she can survive in there main camp will be a breeze.</p>

      <p>"We are missing her a lot, Mia is a bit too young to understand where mummy is, Ella knew she was going into the jungle but just thinks of it as Mummy going to work.</p>
      <p>"But I’ve got Daddy daycare under control – it’s how we work together when she’s here anyway. We rely on each other to help so the other can go to work – just like any other married couple would.</p>
      <p>"I go to work in my tattoo shop and she goes to work at her Academy so we try and work around each other for childcare. But we will be there waiting for her when she comes out wearing our Team Jac outfits!"</p>
      <p>Dan thinks Jacqueline will make some great friends during her time Down Under, but that she'll be particularly excited about sharing the camp with Caitlyn Jenner, and that some of them will definitely wind her up.</p>

      <p>He said: "I think she will get on with most of them, they all seem like a nice group. I know she will be loving Caitlyn because she loves the Kardashians, and we’ve already seen her have her first moan about her idea on how to cook the food being ignored then the same idea offered by James so I think there will be more of that!"</p>
      <p>But one thing's for certain, Dan isn't worried about Jacqueline.</p>
      <p>He said: "Nah, she’s a strong one is Jac. I can’t wait for people to see the real her, I wanted her to have this adventure for her, so she could be known as something other than Lauren from EastEnders.</p>
      <p>"It’s such a one off experience I just really want her to enjoy it! People need to see the real Jac and I’m A Celebrity will give her that chance."</p>
