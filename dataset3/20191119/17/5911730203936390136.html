      <h1>Vegan man suing Burger King claims Impossible Whopper was 'contaminated' by meat</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T17:28:15+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 17:28</time> by <a rel="author">CNN Newsource</a></address>
      <p>A man is suing Burger King because the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/01/business/impossible-whopper-national/index.html">meatless Impossible Whopper </a>is<b> </b>cooked on the same grill as meat products, the lawsuit alleges.</p>
      <p>The class action lawsuit, filed Monday in the Southern District of Florida, claims<b> </b>that although the burger chain advertises its vegan option as meat-free, it is contaminated by meat by-product because it's cooked on the same grill as meat products.</p>
      <p>The suit accuses Burger King of false advertising and benefiting monetarily from offering a vegan option that is not in fact vegan.</p>
      <p>Burger King declined to comment to several media outlets. CNN's sister network HLN has reached out to Burger King for a response to the allegations in the lawsuit but has not yet heard back.</p>
      <p><a href="https://company.bk.com/menu-item/impossible-whopper">Burger King's website </a>describes the Impossible Whopper as "100% Whopper, 0% Beef."</p>
      <p>"For guests looking for a meat-free option, a non-broiler method of preparation is available upon request," the site notes.</p>
      <p>Phillip Williams, the plaintiff in the case, is a vegan who does not eat or drink anything that uses animal by-products.</p>
      <p>He purchased an Impossible Whopper at a location in Atlanta in August after seeing advertisements and paid "premium price" for the meatless option, according to the lawsuit.</p>
      <p>The lawsuit alleges that if he had known the burger would be cooked in such a manner, he would have not purchased it.</p>
      <p>The Burger King that Williams visited did not have signage at the drive-thru indicating that the<b> </b>plant-based burger would be cooked on the same grill as meat, the suit says.</p>
      <p>Williams "suffered monetary damages in the amount that he paid to purchase" the Impossible Whopper, according to the suit.</p>
      <p>The lawsuit indicates that several other consumers have made similar complaints online about the chain's practice surrounding the sale of the Impossible Whopper.</p>
      <p>The Impossible Whopper has been deemed a huge success for Burger King, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/28/investing/restaurant-brands-earnings-burger-king-popeyes/index.html">fueling its best quarter in four years</a> , according to Restaurant Bands ( <a href="https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=QSR&amp;source=story_quote_link">QSR</a> ).</p>
