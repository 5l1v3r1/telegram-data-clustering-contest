      <p><b>Result: </b>Brazil 3-0 Korea Republic</p>
      <p><b>Date: </b>Tuesday, 19 November 2019</p>
      <p><b>Venue:</b> Mohammed Bin Zayed Stadium, Abu Dhabi</p>
      <p>Fresh from a 1-0 defeat to arch-rivals Argentina, and on the back of a five-match winless streak that stretched back to the Copa America final in July, Brazil took on Korea Republic at the neutral venue of Mohammed Bin Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi.</p>
      <p>The record five-time FIFA World Cup champions made five changes from the side that contested the Clasico del Atlantico, with Marquinhos coming in for Paris Saint-Germain teammate Thiago Silva, Renan Lodi starting in place of Alex Sandro, Fabinho replacing Casemiro, Philippe Coutinho swapping in for Willian, and Roberto Firmino falling out for Richarlison. </p>
      <p>Their opponents on the day headed into the match following disappointment of their own after playing out a 0-0 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifier draw with minnows Lebanon last Thursday, and also made five changes to their starting line-up for the fixture. </p>
      <p>Brazil took the lead in the 10th minute through AC Milan star Lucas Paqueta, who was <a href="https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/international/categories/world-news/neymar-rivaldo-spark-controversy-over-brazil-s-no-10-jersey/667648">widely criticised</a> for his performance at the weekend, after Philippe Coutinho and Renan Lodi combined well to set the No. 10 clear to head home. </p>
      <p>Korea Republic came close to equalising 10 minutes later when star man Son Heung-min sent a curling effort narrowly wide after a set-piece scramble, and replays suggested that Brazil could have been penalised for a handball in the box during the build-up. </p>
      <p>Nonetheless, the Brazilians doubled their lead in the 35th minute through Coutinho, who netted his 17th international goal with a curling free-kick that sailed beyond the outstretched arm of Cho Hyun-Woo in goal.</p>
      <p>In the last notable moment of the half, the Bayern Munich playmaker then nearly put the ball in his own net after goalkeeper Alisson Becker fumbled the ball into his path, but saw his scuffed clearance ricochet off the upright to keep the score at 2-0. </p>

      </p>
      <p>Korea Republic came out with intent in the second half, and nearly pulled one back through Son within a minute of the restart. A swift counter-attack down the right side saw the ball worked to the Tottenham Hotspur star in the box, but he could not keep his volleyed effort down. </p>
      <p>The Asian giants were punished for their profligacy in the 60th minute, when right-back Danilo latched on to Lodi's driven pass to score his first international goal with a venomous effort from the edge of the box. </p>
      <p>That goal spurred Brazil on, and forwards Richarlison and Gabriel Jesus both came close to adding to their side's lead, but couldn't get their respective efforts on target. </p>
      <p>Korea Republic continued to fight for a way back into the match, however, and came close twice with about a quarter of an hour left to play. In both instances, Son was the at the heart of his side's attack, but saw two powerful efforts denied by Alisson in goal. </p>
      <p>Roberto Firmino was brought on for Brazil during the dying stages of the match, and almost had an immediate impact. The Liverpool star played Merseyside rival Richarlison through on goal, but the Everton forward could only slice his effort wide. </p>
      <p>That proved to be last real chance for both teams, and Brazil were able to comfortably run down the clock to secure a 3-0 win. </p>

      </p>
      <p>The result saw Brazil end the 2019 on a high and crown a calendar year campaign that saw them lift the Copa America title for the first time since 2007.</p>
