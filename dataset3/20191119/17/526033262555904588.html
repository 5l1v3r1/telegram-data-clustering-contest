      <p>Nine people were indicted on a range of charges related to the alleged <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/family-deceased-ohio-university-student-sues-fraternity-claiming/story?id=61089659">hazing death</a> of an 18-year-old Ohio University student, officials announced.</p>
      <p>An Athens County grand jury handed down the indictments Monday, just over a year after Collin Wiant died of asphyxiation from nitrous oxide ingestion on Nov. 12, 2018.</p>
      <p>The charges include hazing, involuntary manslaughter, reckless homicide, trafficking and tampering with evidence, according to a statement from the Athens County prosecuting attorney.</p>
      <p>The individuals indicted include: Joshua Thomas Androsac, 20; Saxon Angell-Perez; Dominic A. Figliola; Corbin Michael Gustafson, 22; Zachary Herskovitz, 22; Cullen Willi McLaughlin, 20; Elijah Robert Wahib, 22; James Dylan Wanke, 25; and Stephan Brent Lewis, 27.</p>
      <p>It was not immediately clear if any had yet retained legal representation.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, an attorney for Wiant's family said the indictments marked "a very important day."</p>
      <p>"Without severe consequences, there will not be change and lives will continue to be lost. … The criminal justice system needs to send a message and we believe that’s exactly what the Athens County Prosecutor’s Office is doing," attorney Rex Elliot said in a statement to ABC News. "Our goal is to eliminate hazing in its entirety so that no other mother and father have to lose a child."</p>

      <p>Wiant was a freshman at the university and had been selected as a pledge two months before he died, according to a wrongful death suit filed by his family in February against the fraternity and 10 unnamed individuals.</p>
      <p>The teenager died inside a Sigma Pi Epsilon annex house in Athens, Ohio, where he was allegedly beaten with a belt, pelted with eggs, deprived of sleep and forced to take drugs and drink a gallon of alcohol in an hour, the lawsuit alleged.</p>
      <p>Since Wiant's death, and amid new reports of hazing, the university announced in October it had <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/ohio-university-suspends-fraternity-chapters-amid-reports-hazing/story?id=66058048">suspended</a> all 15 of its Interfraternity Council fraternity chapters.</p>

      <p>Joshua Thomas Androsac: one count of permitting drug abuse, a felony of the fifth degree; one count of hazing, a misdemeanor of the fourth degree; one count of involuntary manslaughter, a felony of the first degree; two counts of trafficking in harmful intoxicants, felonies of the fifth degree; and trafficking in cocaine, a felony of the fifth degree</p>
