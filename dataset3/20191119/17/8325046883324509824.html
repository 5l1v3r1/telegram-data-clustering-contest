          <b>A group of vegans are suing Burger King for engaging in what they claim are deceptive practices surrounding its plant-based Impossible Whopper, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/vegan-man-sues-burger-king-says-impossible-whoppers-contaminated-meat-n1085416">NBC reported</a>.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>The vegan plaintiffs say the Impossible burger is not actually meat-free because the patties are prepared on the same broiler as beef patties.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>The lawsuit demands Burger King to take all of the profits made off of the sale and marketing of the Impossible Whopper and <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90432707/a-vegan-is-suing-burger-king-because-its-impossible-whoppers-are-meat-adjacent">redirect it to the plaintiffs.</a></b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>While the standard Impossible Whopper is cooked on the same broiler as beef patties, the Burger King website says that customers seeking a meat-free option can ask to have the patties prepared separately.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Burger King began selling the plant-based burger in August and has received some backlash in the past after customers in New York were allegedly sold beef patties they believed were made with Impossible Meat.</b>

      <p>Fast-food giant Burger King is facing a potential multi-million dollar lawsuit from a group of vegans who say the franchise’s plant-based Whopper option was contaminated with real animal meat.</p>
      <p>The suit, brought forth by Philip Williams in Miami court on behalf of several vegans, claims the chain’s <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/impossible-foods">Impossible</a> Whopper, made with a plant-based fake meat, is contaminated by animal by-products when it’s cooked on the chain’s broiler, and therefore isn’t totally meat-free.</p>
      <p>The court documents, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90432707/a-vegan-is-suing-burger-king-because-its-impossible-whoppers-are-meat-adjacent">reviewed by Fast Company</a>, say Burger King’s preparation process is unclear, and that vegans wouldn’t purchase the burgers if they knew they were cooked on the same surface as animal meat. Specifically, the collection of vegan plaintiffs are accusing Burger King of violating <a href="http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;amp;URL=Ch0501/part02.htm&amp;amp;StatuteYear=2005&amp;amp;Title=-%3E2005-%3EChapter%20501-%3EPart%20II">Florida’s Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act.</a> The suit goes on to claim that Burger King violated the rights of vegans and demands that all the benefits and profits the company received from the burger’s sale be collected and sent to the plaintiffs.</p>
      <p>But a closer look at a sub-note on Burger King’s Impossible Meat web page shows that the company does indeed offer a broiler free alternative.</p>
      <p>“For guests looking for a meat-free option, a non-broiler method of preparation is available upon request,” <a href="https://mobile.bk.com/menu-item/impossible-whopper">the website reads.</a> That method, according to NBC News, involves microwaving the meat substitute.</p>

      <p>Burger King <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/08/01/business/impossible-whopper-national/index.html">started selling its Impossible Whopper in August.</a> Dunkin’, Hardee’s, Little Ceasers, and White Castle all <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/burger-king-tgi-fridays-chains-sell-plant-based-meat-2019-5#the-cheesecake-factory-6">offer some form of plant-based meat alternative</a> on their menus. McDonald’s has <a href="https://www.insider.com/mcdonalds-beyond-meat-burger-test-not-100-percent-vegan-2019-9">reportedly been testing a potential veggie burger</a> made with <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/beyond-meat">Beyond Meat</a>, Impossible Foods’ main competitor (although that one’s not vegan.)</p>
      <p>This isn’t the first time Burger King has run into some controversy around its fake meat patty. Earlier this year, a Brooklyn location came under fire after a customer said they had ordered Impossible Whoppers for delivery on Seamless <a href="https://ny.eater.com/2019/6/6/18652268/burger-king-impossible-whopper-nyc-fake-order">but were given meat patties instead.</a> In that specific case, the storefront listed the Impossible meat variant even though they had yet to stock the plant-based meat alternative. One vegetarian customer, according to Eater, ate two of the Whoppers before realizing they were meat.</p>
