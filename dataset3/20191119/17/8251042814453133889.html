      <p>KITCHENER – The pregnant woman who was <a href="https://kitchener.ctvnews.ca/boy-6-in-stable-condition-after-being-hit-by-train-woman-30-critical-1.4684038">hit by a train last week</a> in Kitchener, Ont. is recovering in hospital.</p>
      <p>Jenna Armstrong's family confirmed to CTV on Tuesday morning that she's now in stable condition. Last week, police had listed her condition as critical.</p>
      <p>The woman's family issued a statement saying their hearts go out to everyone who was involved, sending their best wishes for the full recovery of the six-year-old boy who was also hurt by the train.</p>
      <p>"We are grateful to everybody who has helped out, including first responders, medical staff, friends and family," the statement reads in part.</p>
      <p>Marc Laderoute owns an auto shop near the Lancaster Street rail crossing where Armstrong and the boy were hit.</p>
      <p>His security camera caught the whole incident.</p>
      <p>"Based on what I saw it looked like she tried to push the child out of harm's way at the last second and took pretty much full impact of the train," he says.</p>
      <p>Armstrong's family tells CTV that she was 13 weeks pregnant. Both she and the unborn baby survived the crash.</p>
      <p>She's already undergone multiple surgeries, but her family is hopeful.</p>
      <p>"Jenna has a difficult road ahead of her, but every day we are more optimistic that she'll make a full recovery."</p>
      <p>Last week, the Ministry of Labour confirmed that Armstrong was working as a therapist for BitKids Behaviour Therapy.</p>
      <p>Police are still investigating the circumstances around the crash.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, the woman's family has <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/jga19-jenna-strong">set up an online fundraiser</a> to help cover costs during her recovery.</p>
      <p>In just two days, it had raised more than $15,000.</p>
