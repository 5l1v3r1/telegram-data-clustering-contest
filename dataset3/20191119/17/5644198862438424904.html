      <p>ANKARA: President Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday (Nov 19) he told US President Donald Trump during talks in Washington last week that Turkey would not give up on the Russian S-400 missile defence systems it procured this year despite protests from its NATO ally.</p>
      <p>Erdogan and Trump held talks at the White House to overcome mounting differences between the allies. Washington has said the S-400s pose a threat to its F-35 stealth fighter jets and has suspended Turkey from the jet programme, where it is a buyer and manufacturer. It has also warned of US sanctions over the deal, but has yet to impose them.</p>

      <p>Speaking to members of his AK Party in parliament, Erdogan also said he had told Trump that if the United States maintained its "uncompromising stance" on the F-35s, Turkey would have to seek alternatives to meet its medium-term defence needs.</p>
