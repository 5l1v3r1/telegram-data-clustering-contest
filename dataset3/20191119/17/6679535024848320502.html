      <p>Corporation Commissioner Sravan Kumar Jatavath inaugurated the renovated clock tower near North Coimbatore Flyover on Mettupalayam Road here on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The tower was renovated by Round Tables of Coimbatore City that were the branch organisations under Round Table India, a release said.</p>
      <p>The clock tower would have analogue clocks on all four sides that were synchronised to satellite-based global positioning system to display the time accurately.</p>
      <p>The renovation works were carried out in the past one year by the members using the seed fund and contributions from sponsors from the city, the release added.</p>
      <p>The clock tower was first inaugurated in 1994 by Round Tables of Coimbatore City to mark the national annual general meeting of Round Table India here. The then-Corporation Commissioner, C. Chandramouli, inaugurated the clock tower on December 30.</p>
      <p>M. Jayakumar, Jayakumar Ramdass and Illango Kasthuri, who served as the past National Presidents of Round Table India, were present during the inauguration of the renovated tower.</p>
      <p>With 300 chapters known as ‘Tables’ across India, Round Table India is a non-government organisation for social welfare which focuses on education as its long-term project. The organisation has built 6,625 classrooms in 2,849 schools across the country at over ₹ 282 crore, which benefited over 72.8 children, according to the release.</p>
