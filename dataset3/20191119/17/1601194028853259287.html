      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/sports/gareth-southgate">Gareth Southgate</a> is a fan favourite right now and there are not many managers in the world who are loved to such an extent by their respective clubs or countries. English fans have been chanting their manager's name for some time now but Southgate has refused to get carried away.</p>
      <p>Southgate's current contract with the <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/england">England </a>FA expires only after the <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/football/fifa-world-cup-2022-qatar">2022 World Cup</a> in Qatar but the manager is not sure if he will be in charge of the side at the marquee tournament. He was quoted by <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/12016/11864517/gareth-southgate-says-he-may-not-be-england-boss-at-world-cup-2022-if-euro-2020-goes-badly">Sky Sports News</a> saying:</p>
      <blockquote>"Well, that will depend very much on how we get on next summer. When you have a week like you've had, you sense that people can fall out of love with you and if there isn't a warmth for you to continue, then that can start to affect the team. So, I'm realistic about how quickly those tides can turn, but we've always planned short, mid and long-term over the last eight years.‚Äù</blockquote>
      <p>England safely made it to EURO 2020 by topping their group in the qualifiers. They lost just one of their 8 qualifying matches while scoring 37 and conceding just 6 goals in those games. Their only loss was a 2-1 reversal at the hands of the Czech Republic, who finished 2nd in the table.</p>
