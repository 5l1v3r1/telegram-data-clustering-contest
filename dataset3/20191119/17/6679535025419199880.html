      <h1>Check-dam floods farms, blocks water flow</h1>
      <h2>Makes life difficult for residents</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T17:44:53+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 17:44</time> by <a rel="author">Staff Reporter</a></address>
      <p>Despite repeated protests, the authorities are yet to address the issues of Pavumba and Thazhava residents who allege that the unscientific construction of a check-dam across the Pallikkal river has affected their everyday life.</p>
      <p>During the floods in August, many low-lying areas in the taluk were completely inundated and farmers had to suffer huge losses as their entire crop was destroyed.</p>
      <h3>Report sought</h3>
      <p>Moreover, many houses were flooded and over 300 families were shifted to relief camps at Pavumba and Thodiyoor.</p>
      <p>Following that, the District Collector had instructed the Additional District Magistrate to submit a report after consulting experts. According to the residents, the check-dam has been blocking the water flow and flooding their roads and farms. They say it is unable to handle the flow during rainy season, leading to heavy flooding. Though the officials assured remedial measures if they find technical flaws in the construction, the situation remains the same. Officials from the Minor and Major Irrigation and Harbour Engineering wings who visited the area say the check-dam, which is just 1.5 m high, cannot possibly pose any hindrance to the water flow.</p>
      <p>But the farmers living in the low-lying area say they are under permanent threat and demand immediate intervention. The members of the Churuli Padasekhara Samiti say that even moderate rain is now inundating their farms.</p>
