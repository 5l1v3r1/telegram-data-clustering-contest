      <p>Has the Telangana government commenced the process of privatising 5,100 permits of the TSRTC or has just taken a decision to initiate the process?</p>
      <p>The arguments in the Telangana High Court on Tuesday in a PIL challenging the State Cabinet decision to privatise 5,100 permits of the TSRTC centred around these two questions. Though no order was pronounced on the matter, a Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Raghvendra Singh Chauhan and Justice A. Abhishek Reddy heard the arguments for over two hours and decided to continue the hearing on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>While the petitioners’ counsel Chikkudu Prabhakar contended that the Telangana Cabinet has already begun the process of privatising 5,100 permits of the TSRTC, the HC observed that it has not yet reached that stage. “The Cabinet has taken a decision in principle to initiate the process of privatisation, but it has not yet commenced it,” the Bench observed.</p>
      <p>But the Bench agreed that the State government has no option but to follow the procedure set out in Section 102 of the Motor Vehicles (MV) Act-1988 if the privatisation process commences. As per Section 102 of the Act, the government has to give an opportunity of hearing to any person (in present case the TSRTC) likely to be affected by privatisation.</p>
      <p>A notification on privatisation should be issued in an Official Gazette and in one of the regional language newspapers in the area concerned.</p>
      <p>These along with other steps are mandatory. “If the government has commenced the privatisation process and not followed the procedure, then it can be challenged,” the Bench observed.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, the CJ, who made Mr. Prabhakar read Section 102 repeatedly, explained to him that that was the only provision based on which he can challenge the Cabinet decision. That too, however, only when the process of privatisation begins.</p>
      <p>Mr. Prabhakar said the privatisation would affect the livelihood of 48,000 employees of the TSRTC. It would amount to depriving the workers of the right to livelihood, he argued. “But the law made by the legislature is like that. And Section 102 doesn’t speak about the rights of workers,” the Bench observed.</p>
      <p>The CJ said in the era of globalisation and capitalism, the governments were opening up public sectors to private operators. Earlier, skies were reserved only for Air India, but the Centre eventually allowed private operators to function.</p>
      <p>While some private parties prospered, operators like Kingfisher died out, the Bench noted. Even the railways was being opened up for the private sector, the Bench said. But Mr. Prabhakar said he can cite several judgments of the Supreme Court which observed that private operators cannot be encouraged at the cost of public sector.</p>
      <p>The hearing would continue on Wednesday.</p>
