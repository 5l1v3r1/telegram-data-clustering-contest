          <p>FIFA 20 is set to include a new patch to the FIFA 20 to which several fans are hopeful that their issues will be resolved after several games detected faults in the latest football game released by EA Sports.</p>
          <p>It is reported that major changes will be fixes for player switching, improvement to shot quality in the box as well as adding more fluidity to ground passing.</p>

                <p>The patch has already been included in the PC and it will be released on Playstation 4 and Xbox One at later date. Switching between players while attempting to standing tackle has also been added in after many players complained about being left wide open at the back.</p>

                      <p>Player switching has plagued past instalments and some fans are hoping that the latest patch will make it much tighter in terms of responsiveness.</p>
                      <p>Shooting at close range has been upgraded to minimise the number of errors when one on one with the goalkeeper. ‘Vertical ball velocity’ has also been reduced which means that shots are less likely to balloon over the bar at such close range.</p>

                          <p>Further, the final big change in the game is the speed of passing from the goal-kicks. Gamers complained that the slow runups by the goalkeepers allow forwards from the opponent team to get in front of the defenders, making the one-on-one situation easier.</p>
                          <anchor name="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148">
                            <p>However, it has been reported that the new patch will increase the speed of keepers during the runups as well as other actions during the set-pieces.</p>

                            <p>Other small fixes include improved player positioning from penalty kicks, meaning they won’t look in the direction they will place their penalty.</p>

                            <p>Although, the primary issue which FIFA 20 is facing is of its online servers, which the new patch is not going to improve and EA sports have to look into it.</p>
