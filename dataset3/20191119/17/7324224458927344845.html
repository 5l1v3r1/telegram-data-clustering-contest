      <h1>Salad bar Tossed becomes latest high street chain to ask for cut in rents</h1>

      <p>The owner of salad bar businesses Tossed and Vital Ingredient has become the latest high street chain to launch a painful restructuring programme after submitting plans for a company voluntary arrangement (CVA).</p>
      <p>Zest Food called on landlords to allow it to trade for free or heavily reduced rates to secure the company’s long-term future.</p>
      <p>The company blamed its downturn on the 13 Vital Ingredients branded stores it purchased out of administration last year.</p>
      <p>It said the shops saw trading decline “significantly below expectations” and a restructuring became “unavoidable”.</p>
      <p>The group added that Tossed “remains in growth” despite facing tough market conditions, cost inflation and uncertainty in the economic backdrop.</p>

      <p>If landlords agree to the proposals, all stores will continue to trade with no job losses, bosses said.</p>
      <p>Managing director Neil Sebba said: “The directors consider a CVA as the best way to protect the Tossed brand, provide breathing space for the company and provide strong foundations on which the business can grow in the future. </p>
      <p>“As part of this we are asking landlords to look at the rent that we pay to ensure all the stores remain viable.</p>
      <p>“Our proposals do not involve closing any stores in the short term, and as such we seek to protect all our employees. However, they do require all landlords to accept a combination of rent-free and rent reductions to ensure their store remains part of a viable estate set up for the long term.”</p>
      <p>The Vital Ingredients stores will be turned into Tossed outlets, he added.</p>
      <p>Vincent McKevitt opened the first Tossed outlet in Paddington in 2005 and the group now has 25 sites across the UK, with the majority in London.</p>
      <p>The Zest group expanded last year through the acquisition of rival Vital Ingredient from administration, taking control of its 13 sites.</p>
      <p>In the same month, Mr McKevitt pleaded guilty and was convicted of attacking two bouncers at a Chelsea nightclub.</p>
      <p>He blamed his high-protein and low-carb diet for succumbing to the impact of alcohol and his eventual meltdown, the court was told.</p>
      <p>He was placed on a 12-month community order, given 250 hours community service and ordered to pay each victim £150 compensation, £620 costs and a £115 victim surcharge.</p>
      <p>Several retailers have used CVAs in recent years, including Arcadia, Monsoon Accessorize and Mothercare.</p>
      <p>The latter eventually went bust and is currently seeing administrators close all its sites.</p>
