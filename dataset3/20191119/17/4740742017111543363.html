      <h1>Bristol City coach expects Neil Warnock to return to management after Cardiff City exit</h1>
      <h2>Assistant head coach explained no-show following Robins win in Welsh capital</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T17:54:03+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 17:54</time> by <a rel="author">Gregor MacGregor</a></address>
      <p>Bristol City's Dean Holden has explained that Neil Warnock gave no hint of his imminent departure from Cardiff City the weekend before last.</p>
      <p>After the Robins triumphed 1-0 at the Cardiff City Stadium on the Sunday, Neil Warnock did not have a drink with the Robins coaching staff following the game.</p>
      <p>The Robins assistant head coach revealed that instead the coaching team had a beer with Warnock's assistants Kevin Blackwell, Ronnie Jepson and Andy Dibble following a first win in 17 years over the bridge.</p>
      <p>And Holden said there was no hint <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/neil-warnock-departs-cardiff-city-3527045">of what was to come following the match</a>: that Warnock was about to leave the Welsh capital after three years in charge, a quirk of fate seeing the spell book-ended by a win and a loss against <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">Bristol City</a>.</p>

      <p>The veteran coach is not expected to be out of work for long.</p>
      <p>"The couple of times we've played them, he's not been available to come in afterwards," explained Holden following the game.</p>
      <p>"We had a beer after the game with some of their staff: Kevin Blackwell and Ronnie Jepson and Andy Dibble.</p>
      <p>"I was chatting to Kevin Blackwell about what they might do in the summer - because obviously they'd already announced that he was set to retire in the summer.</p>
      <p>"Kevin was joking around that he's done this more times than Sir Alex Ferguson has.</p>

      <p>"Obviously that night or the next day he left the job but I watched the BT thing where they mic'ed him up - have you seen it? A doucumentary. It's only a 20-minute thing and it's really interesting.</p>
      <p>"And at the end of that it said that he's 26 games short of 1,500 [league games managed] I noticed. I thought to myself straightaway that there's no way - and nor should he - retire with 26 games to go to what could be a huge massive milestone for him.</p>
      <p>"I'm sure that someone will come calling for him at some point. He's obviously a very colourful character in the game, for 30-40 years. I'm sure the game will miss him and he'll miss the game.</p>
      <p>"I expect him to come back at some point for sure," explained Holden, at the pre-Nottingham Forest press conference.</p>
      <p>We make it 1,655 games for Warnock across all levels including non-league matches, for the veteran boss who has been linked with the Hearts job recently - <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/former-bristol-city-nottingham-forest-3536090">along with former City boss Steve Cotterill</a>.</p>
      <p>The<a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/smith-dasilva-hunt-latest-bristol-3554896"> assistant head coach explained that Jay Dasilva's scan</a> on his tibia last week was positive but the full-back is still expected to be out for a few weeks yet.</p>
      <p>Jack Hunt will be assessed later this week as to whether he can return against Nottingham Forest on Saturday.</p>
