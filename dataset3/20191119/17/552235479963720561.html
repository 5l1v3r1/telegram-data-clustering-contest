      <h2>The supermerket chain plan to take over the old Aldi unit in town.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T17:20:15+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 17:20</time> by <a rel="author">Kilmarnock Standard, Sarah Hilley, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/kilmarnock-standard/, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/sarah-hilley/</a></address>
      <p>Up to 30 jobs will be up for grabs at a new Food Warehouse store in <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kilmarnock">Kilmarnock</a>.</p>
      <p>The Iceland supermarket chain got the green light to sell alcohol at premises in the Glencairn Retail Park during a licensing board meeting today.</p>
      <p>The application to sell booze was granted despite a tough policy on getting new alcohol licences in East Ayrshire.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Members heard Iceland might walk away from the Kilmarnock unit if it was barred from selling liquor.</p>
      <p>The decision went to a tied vote among councillors, with three refusing the bid for the bulk buy shop to offer booze.</p>
      <p>Licensing depute clerk Stuart McCall described the council’s licensing policy as a “critical issue” and a “major obstacle” to allowing alcohol to be sold by the Food Warehouse.</p>
      <p>Solicitor Niall Hassard told councillors the application was “for an Iceland concept known as the Food Warehouse”.</p>
      <p>He called the sites “flagship new stores” which are more than double the size of a typical Iceland.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Describing it as a “coup” for Iceland to bag the retail space in Kilmarnock, he also pointed out the new business would fill an empty shop.</p>
      <p>The board heard there would be no zero-hour contracts and staff are paid above the living wage.</p>
      <p>There would be between 25 to 30 new posts, including nine full-time jobs.</p>
      <p>While deliberating over the application Councillor Lillian Jones said: “You’re saying if the licence is refused you could walk away from the store.”</p>
      <p>Mr Hassard confirmed Iceland would rethink the matter if it was turned down.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The meeting heard alcohol makes up about 3 per cent of their sales.</p>
      <p>Three councillors voted to reject the application while the same number voted to approve it.</p>
      <p>Councillor George Mair, who moved to grant the licence, said: “The benefits outweigh the presumption for refusal.”</p>
      <p>Board chair Tom Cook had the deciding vote and ruled the alcohol licence would be granted.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Councillor Ian Grant could not vote as he arrived late to the meeting.</p>
      <p>Iceland applied for the provisional grant of a premises licence for off-sales during Monday to Friday from 10am to 10pm. The alcohol display area will measure 22 square metres.</p>
      <p>There are 14 Food Warehouse stores in Scotland.</p>
