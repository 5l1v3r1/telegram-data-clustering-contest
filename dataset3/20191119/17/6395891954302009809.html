      <p><b>BOSTONÂ (AP)</b> - The Latest on the release of a toy safety group's annual worst toys list (all times local):</p>
      <p>11:30 a.m.</p>
      <p>The toy industry is dismissing a safety group's annual worst toys list as misleading and needlessly frightening to parents.</p>
      <p>The Toy Association says World Against Toys Causing Harm doesn't run safety tests on the toys.</p>
      <p>In contrast, the industry trade group says all toys sold in the U.S. must meet more than 100 "rigorous safety tests and standards" by law.</p>
      <p>The association represents most of the toy makers named on WATCH's list. It also suggests parents buy toys from reputable stores and online sellers.</p>
      <p>A high-powered Nerf gun, ice cream-scented Nickelodeon slime and a plastic Power Rangers claw are among the toys topping the list released Tuesday by WATCH.</p>
      <p>The Massachusetts-based nonprofit has been issuing the lists ahead of the holidays for more than four decades.</p>

      <p>A Nerf gun, ice cream-scented Nickelodeon slime and a plastic Power Rangers claw are among the toys making a consumer safety group's annual list of worst toys for the holidays.</p>
      <p>World Against Toys Causing Harm, or WATCH, unveiled its list Tuesday at a Boston children's hospital.</p>
      <p>A realistic toy machine gun, the Pogo Trick Board, a yeti teddy bear and a pull-along caterpillar toy for infants also made the list.</p>
      <p>The Massachusetts-based nonprofit says many of the products present choking, eye and other safety hazards found in poorly designed toys.</p>
      <p>It also cites the products for having inconsistent and inadequate warning labels.</p>
      <p>The industry trade group The Toy Association didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment. In the past, it has dismissed the list as biased and inaccurate.</p>
