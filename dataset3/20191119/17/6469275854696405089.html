      <p>Recorder Wright QC imposed a two year community order with a curfew and 10 rehabilitation activity days.</p>
      <p>He was also given a five year sexual harm prevention order, and must pay a £90 victim surcharge.</p>
      <p>A previous hearing at the magistrates’ court was told the defendant became involved in exchanging messages with a girl he believed to be 13.</p>
      <p>He admitted in interview that although she gave different ages he did eventually believe her to be 13.</p>
      <p>But the person he was messaging were adults involved in a paedophile hunting network.</p>
      <p>During the course of the conversation Griffin had asked for pictures of her naked breasts and some pictures were sent to him.</p>
      <p>At the same hearing his defence lawyer, Laura Walmsley said the “pseudo person” had appeared in the ‘people you may know’ section of Facebook and he had not deliberately sought out a 13-year-old girl.</p>
      <p>She also said it was a very “juvenile conversation” that went on, but acknowledged it did become criminal.</p>
      <p>Judges need to consider a number of factors when imposing a sentence to ensure the sentence is one of punishment, rehabilitation, reparation and public protection.</p>
      <p>The Sentencing Council states that a mental illness or learning disability can be a mitigating factor when considering a suitable punishment.</p>
      <p>In addition, judges or magistrates have to take the abilities and support needs of individual offenders into consideration, in order to avoid unreasonable or unrealistic expectations being imposed on them when sentenced.</p>
