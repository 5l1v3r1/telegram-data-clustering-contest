      <p>BTS have spoken about the ‘pressure’ they feel to present themselves in a ‘perfect’ way to their fans.</p>
      <p>Despite their huge fanbase, called ARMY, being more concerned with the members being happy and healthy, rapper RM admits he feels he has to maintain a certain image.</p>
      <p>‘It would be untruthful if I said there was no pressure. Still, on stage I want to do really well,’ <a href="https://www.papermag.com/break-the-internet-bts-2641354203.html?rebelltitem=57#rebelltitem57">he told Paper Magazine.</a></p>
      <p>Suga, also a rapper, agreed with him, saying: ‘I would not be telling the truth if I said there’s no pressure. But what can you do? Pressure is also one part of life.’</p>
      <p>J-Hope added: ‘I can’t say we don’t [feel pressure]. These days, I feel like I live with a sense of mission.</p>
      <p>‘Rather than thinking, “It has to be perfect!,” I do what I have to do, making sure I remember the really important and fundamental things and trust that the results will follow.’</p>

      <p>‘We will hurry and come back with a new album soon. It will be really soon,’ he told the crowd, according to Yonhap.</p>
      <p>The star continued: ‘While I performed Epiphany, I was saddened at thinking that this might be the last time I’d sing it. ‘Thinking that “It’s the end”, it was bittersweet.’</p>
