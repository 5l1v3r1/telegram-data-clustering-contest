      <p>It's been almost 20 years since the last <i>Shenmue</i> video game. After years of radio silence, a sudden Kickstarter initiative and snippets of action-packed gameplay -- as well as beautifully rendered locales -- <i>Shenmue 3</i> has finally launched worldwide today.</p>
      <p>In addition to the game's release, publisher Deep Silver uploaded a lengthy YouTube video detailing the studio's extensive development process.</p>

      <p>The video includes appearances from prominent YouTubers, former SEGA executives and development studio members that have been working on the series since its revolutionary beginnings back in the 1990s. But <i>Shenmue 3</i> is still very much in-tune with its roots. At its core, the game is still focused on realism, top-notch martial arts combat and revenge.</p>

      <p><i>Shenmue 3</i> is published by Deep Silver and developed by Neilo and YS Net. Franchise veterans Yu Suzuki and Keiji Okayasu co-directed the game. <i>Shenmue 3</i> is available now on PC and PlayStation 4.</p>
