        <b>A church has set its sights on going cashless as it attempts to put a stop to its donation decline.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Chorley United Reformed Church could be saying goodbye to the tradition offering plate as part of its attempts to modernise.</p>

      <p>Church minister Reverend Martin Whiffen said: “Many of our church members already support the church by making a regular standing order payment, but this will offer an easier way to make a gift than having to carry cash.”</p>
      <p>The church also revealed the move comes following a year-on-year decline in money placed in the offering bags at Sunday services.</p>
      <p>And the idea for accepting card came from one of the church’s young people, Jenny Deering.</p>
      <p>Jenny, a Chorley actress who recently returned from a sell-out tour in China, playing Isabella in the Milky Way production of Wuthering Heights, said: “Like many young people, I don’t use cash, so when the offering plate comes round, I often have nothing to give.</p>
      <p>"Now I will be able to tap my card and make an instant donation.</p>
      <p>"It’s daft, but I can’t wait to give it a try.”</p>
      <p>The church was founded in 1792 and is one the largest United Reformed Churches in the North West.</p>
