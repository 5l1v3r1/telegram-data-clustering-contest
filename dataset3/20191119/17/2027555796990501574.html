      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T17:19:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 17:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/pti" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>Bank of Baroda on Tuesday said the RBI has imposed Rs 2.50 crore fine for non-compliance of directions issued to it with regard to Bihar-based NGO Srijan Mahila Vikas Sahyog Samiti Ltd.</p>
      <p>"The Reserve Bank of India in exercise of powers conferred under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949, has imposed a penalty aggregating to Rs 2.50 crore on the bank for non-compliance with the directions issued by the RBI in various accounts of Srijan Mahila Vikas Sahyog Samiti Ltd at Bhagalpur Branch," Bank of Baroda said in a regulatory filing.</p>
      <p>The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is probing the matter in the Rs 1,000 crore scam allegedly involving Bihar-based NGO Srijan Mahila Vikas Sahyog Samiti and government officers.</p>
      <p>Unidentified officers of Bank of Baroda, Indian Bank and the 'Samiti' have been named as accused in the FIRs registered for alleged criminal conspiracy, cheating, forgery among others.</p>
      <p>Besides, FIRs have also been registered in Patna and Delhi.</p>
      <p>It is alleged that there were illegal transfer and misuse of funds from government accounts in Bhagalpur district to accounts of the Samiti through a conspiracy hatched between government officials and office bearers of the NGO.</p>
      <p>It is alleged that the NGO, which was working towards imparting training to women, had pilfered government funds in connivance with the bank officials and state government officials between 2003 and 2014.</p>
      <p>As per initial probe by local police, the Samiti allegedly procured cheque books from banks and forged the signature of the district magistrate to transfer government funds to its account.Â </p>
