        <i>• Maradona lasts eight games at struggling Argentinian side<br/>• Club elections cost Maradona ally his job as president</i>
      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/diego-maradona">Diego Maradona</a> has left his latest club after three months in charge. The former Argentina forward and World Cup winner, who became the manager of Gimnasia in September, said he would continue only if the club’s president, Gabriel Pellegrino, stayed on following club elections but he withdrew when an electoral pact fell apart.</p>
      <p>Maradona, who won the World Cup in 1986, took over the club from La Plata, just outside Buenos Aires, charged with helping them avoid relegation. He lost his first three Primera Division games and, although he has won three of five since, the team are third from bottom and in danger of going down.</p>
      <p>Maradona’s departure repeats a well-worn theme in his managerial career. Of the six club sides he has managed only one job lasted more than a year. The only team he managed for longer was Al Wasl of the United Arab Emirates, where he remained for 14 months in 2011-12.</p>
      <p>His previous job before returning to Argentina was at the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/14/diego-maradona-mexico-culiacan-new-documentary-series">Mexican club Dorados de Sinaloa</a>, which he left in June after nine months.</p>
