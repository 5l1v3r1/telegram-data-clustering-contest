      <h2>CM says she is ‘armtwisting’ officials to work in her favour</h2>

      <p>Referring to Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi as ‘sister to Adolf Hitler,’ Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy lashed out at Bedi for ‘arm-twisting,’ officials to work in her favour.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the birth anniversary function of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi at the PCC office on Tuesday, the Chief Minister alleged that the Lt. Governor was functioning in an authoritative manner. “No other Lt. Governor or Governor is as obstructionist as Kiran Bedi. She is like Hitler’s sister,” he said.</p>
      <p>The officials were being threatened to toe her line and take orders from Raj Nivas, Mr. Narayanasamy claimed.</p>
      <p>“I feel sympathy for the officials. Even though the Lt. Governor has no powers (in day-to-day governance), some officials will only listen to her. The government knows who those officials are,” he said.</p>
      <p>The Madras High Court in its order had upheld the powers of an elected government, he said.</p>
      <p>Despite the judgment, the Lt. Governor was creating obstacles to unhindered governance. The court in its judgment had also directed the chief secretary and secretaries to abide by the decisions of the Cabinet, he said.</p>
      <p>When sought her response to the Chief Minister’s statement, Ms. Bedi said “It’s not worth it.” Ms. Bedi in the past had condemned the Chief Minister for “demonising” her and questioned the propriety of the people sitting in the constitutional positions making objectionable remarks.</p>
