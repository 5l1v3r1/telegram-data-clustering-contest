      <p>A Kamloops woman has launched a lawsuit alleging she suffered injuries after going on an amusement ride at the Armstrong Interior Provincial Exhibition last year.</p>
      <p>Shawna Marie Palmer is suing the Interior Provincial Exhibition Association, West Coast Amusements Ltd, Thrill Masters and the City of Armstrong, claiming she now suffering from dizziness and headaches, as well as pain in her neck and back, along with a list of other injuries and symptoms after she went on a fairground ride at the IPE in 2018.</p>
      <p>According to court documents filed in the B.C. Supreme Court in February, Palmer rode the "Slingshot" ride three times while attending the fair in 2018 and on the third occasion the "seating cage hit hard on the ground."</p>
      <p>The slingshot is described in the documents as a two-person amusement ride where participants sit in a cage attached to two cables that shoot the cage up into the air which then bounces up and down.</p>
      <p>Palmer alleges the cage hitting the ground left her with a concussion and problems sleeping along with other injuries, which continue to cause her "pain, suffering, discomfort, loss of enjoyment of life, permanent physical disability, and loss of earnings both past and prospective."</p>
      <p>The court documents say the accident has left Palmer "less able" to manage household chores including yard work and household maintenance.</p>
      <p>The documents say Palmer has incurred various expenses due to the accident but doesn't list the amount of compensation Palmer is seeking instead says those details will be provided in the future.</p>
      <p>In a notice to the civil claim, the Interior Provincial Exhibition Association and the City of Armstrong deny any wrongdoing and say "if" Palmer suffered any injury it was caused by her own negligence "and/or" West Coast Amusements and Thrill Masters who operated the ride.</p>
      <p>West Coast Amusements denies the allegation and states that if the injuries took place, which it denies they did, they were caused by Palmer "failing to exercise reasonable care for her safety, failing to keep a proper lookout, failing to pay sufficient attention to her surroundings and failing to use safety equipment to ensure safe use of the slingshot" along with others.</p>
      <p>None of the allegations have been proven in court.</p>
