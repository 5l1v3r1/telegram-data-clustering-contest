      <p>Can you believe it has been ten years since Assassin’s Creed II was released and Ezio Auditore da Firenze arrived on the scene of the war between Assassins and Templars? Well, it has been but even now there is some new content available for the game’s fans as music composer has released 17 music tracks and demos that never made the final cut, and you can listen to them below.</p>

      <p>Assassin’s Creed II spawned a whole trilogy of games starring Ezio with the other two titles being Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood and Assassin’s Creed Revelations. A few years ago the trilogy was remastered into the Ezio Collection. When that released Jim had a go with the collection and he summarised his experience by saying:</p>
      <blockquote>In short, The Ezio Collection is by far the best Assassin’s Creed game I’ve played in years. All I can do now is hope that Ubisoft has taken stock of the past few years and changed course for its flagship series. We won’t know, of course, until we catch our first glimpse of the rumoured Egypt-themed title.</blockquote>
