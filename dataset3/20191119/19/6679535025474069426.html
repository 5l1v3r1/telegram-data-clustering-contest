      <h2>Facility expected to provide relief to Sion, Matunga</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:44:43+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Ajeet-Mahale-13598/" target="_blank">Ajeet Mahale</a></address>
      <p>The proposed pumping station at Mahul will help the Central Railway (CR) prevent train services being affected during monsoon, said S.K. Jain, the outgoing divisional railway manager of the CR’s Mumbai division.</p>
      <p>Mr. Jain, who completed a two-year stint helming the suburban corridors of CR, said despite making several gains, services were hit during this year’s rains.</p>
      <p>“When I joined, people would say that services would be hit even when the city received 70 mm rain. In 2018, we ensured that trains did not stop through the rains. This year too, despite 540 mm rainfall, we managed to run services. But there is always a threshold,” Mr. Jain said.</p>
      <p>CR services were badly affected on several occasions this year, most notably on July 26, when a long-distance passenger train was stranded at Badlapur station and 1,050 passengers on board had to be rescued.</p>
      <p>Mr. Jain said the proposed pumping station at Mahul will ensure that CR services won’t be affected even if the city receives rainfall similar to this year. He said the issue was discussed in recent meetings with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation as well.</p>
      <p>The Mahul pumping station would be the city’s seventh and has been stuck due to land acquisition woes. It is expected to provide relief to Sion and Matunga, which are the worst affected on the suburban corridor during the monsoon.</p>
      <p>The rains this year also severely damaged the ghat section between Lonavala and Karjat, cutting off an important train link between Mumbai and Pune for weeks. Mr. Jain said they had appointed Konkan Railway to look at why the ghat section is so susceptible to damage, and to identify solutions.</p>
      <p>Mr Jain, who was appointed as divisional railway manager shortly after the Elphinstone road stampede, ranked the speed in which CR built over 50 foot overbridges as among his key achievements.</p>
