        <b>We all know Cardi B has been very vocal about her dislike for American President <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a>, and this time isn’t any different.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Cardi B slammed Donald Trump for not loving ‘all Americans’ in Vogue’s latest 73 Questions series – and we don’t blame her.</p>
      <p>She was asked who her least favourite President is, to which she replied: ‘The one that’s going to get impeached, the third one that’s going to get impeached.’</p>
      <p>Cardi has spoken up about her disagreement with Donald, confessing that she’s scared he will win another term and also criticising him for the Government shutdown.</p>
      <p>‘If you don’t love every American citizen, why become President?’ the 27-year-old asked.</p>
      <p>Never underestimate Cardi, okurrr, because she has been reading up on the American political system.</p>
      <p>‘You love reading up about the political system and former US Presidents, what is something you learned about the system that really struck you?’ the interviewer questioned.</p>

      <p>She answered: ‘The system was never made for us.</p>

      <p>‘…Just living in my neighbourhood made me want to speak up. Seeing the injustice, seeing how kids my age, my colour, darker, are being treated in my neighbourhood. That made me want to be involved.’</p>
      <p>Cardi B for president, anyone?</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the star confessed her guilty pleasure was smelling her own feet and we don’t know what to feel about any of it.</p>
      <p>At least she’s honest.</p>
      <p>The Bodak Yellow rapper completed the interview in her grandmother’s adorable flat, and we all got to see Kulture make her Vogue cameo.</p>
      <p>But, shh, she was asleep the entire time.</p>
      <p>Kulture is one lucky child, that’s for sure, as she is the reason Cardi keeps thriving for more success.</p>
      <p>She shared: ‘In order for me to spoil my child for the rest of my life, I have to have money and make money for the rest of my life.’</p>
