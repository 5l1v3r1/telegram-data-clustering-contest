      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/mauricio-pochettino/">Mauricio Pochettino</a>’s reign as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a> Hostpur boss is over after the Argentine was sacked following the club’s ‘extremely disappointing’ start to the season.</p>
      <p>The club are in 14th position in the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> and have won just three of their 12 matches so far this term, leaving them six points off the relegation zone.</p>
      <p>Pochettino took over in north London in 2014 after a single season with Southampton. The Argentine took Spurs to a League Cup final in his first season in charge and they qualified for the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/champions-league/">Champions League</a> in four of his five seasons at the club.</p>
      <p>He also took the club to their first Champions League final in June but their 2-0 defeat against Liverpool cast a long shadow over the club’s preparations for the 2019/20 campaign and he was furious with the lack of investment in the transfer market.</p>

      <p>In a brief statement, Daniel Levy thanked Pochettino for his work and admitted it was a difficult decision to make.</p>

      <p>‘We were extremely reluctant to make this change and it is not a decision the Board has taken lightly, nor in haste,’ a statement read.</p>
      <p>‘Regrettably domestic results at the end of last season and beginning of this season have been extremely disappointing.</p>
      <p>‘It falls to the Board to make the difficult decisions – this one made more so given the many memorable moments we have had with Mauricio and his coaching staff – but we do so in the Club’s best interests.</p>
      <p>‘Mauricio and his coaching staff will always be part of our history. I have the utmost admiration for the manner in which he dealt with the difficult times away from a home ground whilst we built the new stadium and for the warmth and positivity he brought to us. I should like to thank him and his coaching staff for all they have contributed. They will always be welcome here.</p>
      <p>‘We have a talented squad. We need to re-energise and look to deliver a positive season for our supporters.’</p>
      <p>Despite Spurs’ ascent to the Champions League final last term, hints of problems were laid bare in their domestic form.</p>
      <p>The club haven’t won a league game away from home since January and face rivals West Ham at the London Stadium on Saturday where a defeat could leave them three points from the relegation zone.</p>

      <p>Part of Pochettino’s dissatisfaction stems from the club’s failure to deal with the futures of a number of first-team players who are nearing the end of their contract.</p>
      <p>Danny Rose, Christian Eriksen, Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen are all close to the end of their deals at the club and Pochettino wanted to start a new cycle with a stream of new signings.</p>
      <p>However, while he was backed in a club record move for Tanguy Ndombele, Pochettino was unhappy with his side’s transfer dealings.</p>
      <p>The Argentine has rejected interest from Manchester United, Barcelona and Real Madrid in the past to stay in north London.</p>
      <p>Former United boss Jose Mourinho is the early favourite to take charge, while Carlo Ancelotti is second in the running.</p>
