      <p>Recently, a Malaysian ad for male sex vitality drugs went viral after getting serious flack from netizens for the obscene sexual jokes and innuendos made by its two actors that caused outrage online.</p>
      <p>We have the video here but be warned, it’s cringey enough to make you <i>shudder</i>.</p>

      <p>Many netizens who watched the advert were shocked and ashamed at how lightly they were discussing sensitive topics that should remain private between sexual partners.</p>

      <p>The actors insensitively joked about things like their partner’s sperm count and a husband’s ability to satisfy a woman. Towards the end of the video, the male actor even pointed out his female co-star’s hickey as she shamelessly showed it to the world!</p>
      <p>Unsurprisingly, the video was bombarded with comments from netizens who were both fired up by how lightly they were discussing these issues and ashamed about how this represented the Malaysian community.</p>

      <p>Another said, “When you no longer feel shameful for your actions, that’s when you lose all sense of self-esteem.”</p>
      <p>Not all publicity is good publicity. What do you guys think of this?</p>
