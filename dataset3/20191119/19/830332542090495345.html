      <p>MADISON, Wis. - State Supreme Court challenger Jill Karofsky is trying to put incumbent Justice Dan Kelly on the defensive as their first debate gets under way.</p>
      <p>Karofsky and Ed Fallone are looking to unseat Kelly in the spring elections. The three of them will face off in a February primary, with the top two vote-getters advancing to the April general election. The three met for their first debate Monday.</p>
      <p>Karofsky immediately attacked Kelly, accusing him of constantly siding with conservative groups and ruling in their favor.</p>
      <p>Kelly fired back that Karofsky sees everything through a political lens and he decides every case as the law applies to it.</p>
      <p>A clearly annoyed Fallone was given little opportunity to speak. At one point he quipped that he felt like a badminton net between Kelly and Karofsky.</p>
      <p>Then-Gov. Scott Walker appointed Kelly to the court in 2016 to replace retiring Justice David Prosser. Karofsky is a Dane County judge. Fallone is a Marquette University law professor.</p>
      <p>Supreme Court races are officially nonpartisan but Democrats support Karofsky and Fallone and Republicans are rallying behind Kelly. His performance could serve as a harbinger of Republicans' chances statewide in November 2020.</p>
