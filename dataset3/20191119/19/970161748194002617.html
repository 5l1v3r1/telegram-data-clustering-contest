      <p>The Radio 1 DJ also raised a few eyebrows when she revealed her luxury item was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/im-celebrity-fans-baffled-adele-roberts-chooses-framed-photo-jane-mcdonald-luxury-item-11178692/">a photo of singer and Loose Women host Jane McDonald</a> – a move which left some viewers puzzled but others praising her for her offbeat choice.</p>
      <p>One person who will be offering support from back home is Adele’s girlfriend Kate Holderness – who is also looking after her social media accounts in her absence.</p>
      <p>Here’s what you need to know about Kate…</p>
      <h3>Who is Adele Roberts’ girlfriend Kate Holderness?</h3>
      <p>Kate is an actress and vlogger, who began her TV career back in 1997 in the CITV show Knight School.</p>

      <p>However, more recently she’s been seen in Coronation Street, playing a character named Jamie Lee in a couple of episodes in 2013, as well as a pair of period dramas for the BBC – Henry VIII and his Six Wives, in which she played his final wife Catherine Parr, and 2017’s Elizabeth I.</p>

      <p>Her other TV credits include Heartbeat and Emmerdale.</p>
      <p>Kate and Adele also host their own food show, Friday Night Fakeaway – in which they make restaurant-style creations with unusually healthy food ingredients.</p>
      <p>You can catch the pair in action <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&amp;v=CeGjK-J-6GQ">on their YouTube channel.</a></p>
      <p>Kate is also running Adele’s social media channels while she is in the jungle – and has given her followers some insight into <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/jane-mcdonald-absolutely-thrilled-adele-roberts-bringing-framed-photo-im-celebrity-camp-11179207/">the Jane McDonald photo</a>, explaining that every campmate has to choose something different and that her first choices of a pillow and family photo had already been taken.</p>

      <p>‘The brief was “something to make you happy” so she just chose something that never fails to cheer her up and something that reminds her of her Early Morning Radio 1 listeners,’ she explained.</p>
      <p>‘It’s a bit of a long-running feature on Adele’s show, when they’re having a bit of a slump and feeling down, a listener will request a ‘bit of Jane’ to get them through their day. I have to say that most of her decisions are made at 2am when she gets up for her show, most things make perfect sense at that time!’</p>

      <p>She was seen having to let fellow housemate Lee down gently, revealing that she was bi and had a girlfriend outside of the house.</p>
      <p>However Lee took the rejection on the chin and the pair became close friends regardless, remaining close throughout their time on the show.</p>
