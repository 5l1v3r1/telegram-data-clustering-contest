      <p>The Game is getting explicit about his previous relationship with both Kim and Khloe Kardashian.</p>
      <p>The rapper appears on a leaked track from Migos and seemingly bragged about sleeping with both famous sisters. “What You Expect” surfaced on Soundcloud earlier this week.</p>
      <p>“Kim K, that’s my old thing / Khloe K, that’s my old thing,” he rapped. “F**kin’ stars when they was no names / Everything was on the low.”</p>

      <p>This isn’t the first time The Game has rapped about the KKW Beauty mogul when he released a preview of an unreleased song, “I held Kim Kardashian by her throat, nigga/I made her swallow my kids until she choke, nig**/I should apologize cause ’Ye is my folks, nig**.” But he told <a href="https://www.complex.com/music/2019/11/the-game-everyday-struggle-interview-things-we-learned/kim-kardashian-lyrics"><i>Complex</i></a> that the lyrics were old.</p>
      <p>“When that snippet came out, that wasn’t how I currently felt. That song was like 2-years-old,” he explained. “I’m not apologizing for that. I don’t think I need to apologize for doing something that I did that is done already.”</p>
