      <p>Over the past few weeks, there have been multiple reports in Italy and Switzerland discussing where Arsenal’s Granit Xhaka will play next year.</p>
      <p>The midfielder arrived in north London from Borussia Mönchengladbach in 2017 and there were suggestions the German side could be one of the possible destinations for the 27-year-old in January.</p>

      <p><a href="https://sport.sky.de/fussball/artikel/transfer-update/10861226/33895">Sky</a>’s ‘Transfer Update’ relays information mentioned by Bielefeld as they add AC Milan and Inter Milan are interested in the Switzerland international and further state the two Serie A sides are planning to take him on a loan deal with a purchase option for next summer.</p>
