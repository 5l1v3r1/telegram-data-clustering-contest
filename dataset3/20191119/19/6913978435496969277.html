      <p><b>Saudi Gazette report<br/><br/>RIYADH – </b>The Council of Ministers on Tuesday expressed the Kingdom’s condemnation of inhuman and barbaric air raids launched by Israeli occupation forces on the Gaza Strip, which resulted in the death and injury of dozens of civilians, saying that these were in violation of international law, humanitarian principles and international conventions.<br/><br/>Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Salman chaired the weekly session of the Cabinet at Al-Yamamah Palace in Riyadh.<br/><br/>Minister of Media Turki Al-Shabanah said the Cabinet called on the international community to shoulder its responsibilities toward ensuring international protection for the Palestinian people and confronting Israeli policies that violate international law.<br/><br/>The Council welcomed the international consensus to vote on a resolution to renew the mandate of UNRWA for three years, noting that this is an international consensus and commitment to support the rights of the Palestinian people and the right of refugees to return to their homes. The Cabinet pointed out that the Kingdom, being the largest donor of UNRWA, has supported its programs during the period between 2000 and 2019 by pumping nearly $900 million. The total amount of assistance provided by the Kingdom to Palestine valued at $ 7 billion during the same period, in addition to a donation last September to UNRWA of $ 50 million.<br/><br/>Al-Shabanah said the Council welcomed the agreement to establish the Constitutional Committee in Syria and the commencement of its work. It also expressed the hope that this would be supportive to efforts being exerted to reach a political solution to the Syrian crisis in a way fulfilling the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people.<br/><br/>On the tragic situation of the Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar, the Cabinet urged the civilian leadership of that country to fulfill its political and humanitarian responsibility toward minorities, as well as to support its people by embracing all its people without any discrimination or favor. In this regard, the Council referred to the resolution moved by the Kingdom, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the European Union at the United Nations on the human rights situation of Rohingya Muslims and other minorities in Myanmar.<br/><br/>The Council also reviewed the Kingdom’s role and efforts at regional and international levels in contributing to strengthen international peace and security, including security and safety of sea lanes and the freedom of international maritime traffic in the straits and strategic corridors. In this context, the Cabinet referred to the Saudi International Maritime Patrol Ships Forum, titled “The Importance of Securing Strategic Maritime Corridors" to be organized by the Saudi Royal Naval Forces on Nov. 24-26 in Riyadh.<br/><br/>The Council denounced Sunday’s hijacking and armed robbery of a vessel, called “Rabigh 3” by the Iranian-backed Houthi terrorist militia, emphasizing that this poses a real threat to the freedom of international shipping and international trade, and a criminal precedent undermining the security of the Bab El-Mandab Strait.<br/><br/>Al-Shabanah said the Cabinet approved the establishment of a Financial Guarantee Program for Small and Medium Enterprises, supervised by the General Authority for Small and Medium Enterprises. The Council took this decision after examining the report of the minister of commerce and investment and chairman of the board of directors of the authority as well as the recommendation of the Council of Economic and Development Affairs.<br/><br/>The Cabinet also approved an agreement between the governments of Saudi Arabia and France for the development of the cultural, environmental, tourist, human, economic and heritage sectors of Al-Ula region in the Kingdom, the minister added.</p>
