      <p>Around 100 workers of Bharatiya Janata Party on Tuesday courted arrest while staging a protest near the Legislative Assembly to press for the conduct of local body polls.</p>
      <p>They took out a rally from Immaculate Conception Cathedral towards the Assembly.</p>
      <p>But the police stopped them near St. Ange Street and S. V. Patel junction. They shouted slogans against the government for not holding the civic body polls.</p>
      <p>Nominated legislator and BJP president V. Saminathan said local body elections were not held after the tenure of civic body ended in 2011.</p>
      <p>The government was not serious in holding the polls out of fear of losing the elections, he charged.</p>
