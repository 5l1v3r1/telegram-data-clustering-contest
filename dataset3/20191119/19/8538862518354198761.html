      <h1>BioWare Rebrand Underway Following ANTHEM and Mass Effect Rumours</h1>
      <h2>New and improved, hopefully</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:30:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.pushsquare.com/users/ShogunRok" target="_blank">Robert Ramsey</a></address>
      <p>Adding more weight to the recent rumours that BioWare plans on <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/news/2019/11/rumour_anthem_reportedly_not_dead_as_bioware_plans_major_overhauls">rebooting ANTHEM</a> and is currently in the early stages of <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/news/2019/11/rumour_new_mass_effect_game_in_early_development_at_bioware">developing a brand new Mass Effect title</a>, the veteran developer appears to be rebranding itself. <a href="https://twitter.com/bioware">The company's official Twitter account</a> is adorned with a new, more rounded text logo, and brand design website <a href="https://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/follow_up_new_identity_for_bioware_by_tolleson_and_in_house.php">Brand New</a> features a whole page on freshly designed assets. It's all very clean and modern looking.</p>

      <p>As hinted, all of this ties into the ongoing notion that BioWare itself is being overhauled to some extent. Clearly the developer is keen to adopt a new look going forward, which is understandable given the damage that <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/mass_effect_andromeda">Mass Effect: Andromeda</a> and <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/anthem">ANTHEM</a> have done to the company's reputation.</p>
      <p>With <a href="http://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/dragon_age_4">Dragon Age 4</a> in the works, ANTHEM supposedly being rejigged, and Mass Effect apparently making a return at some point, it'll be very interesting to see what becomes of BioWare over the next few years. Here's hoping that the Canadian company rediscovers its once fantastic form.</p>
