      <p>A new patch has been rolled out by Infinity War for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare that amongst other things plugs an exploit that means players can no longer duplicate killstreaks. Another fix stops the select loadout screen continuously reappearing even when a player picks an option in Ground War.  A number of challenges have also been fixed and should trigger properly.</p>
      <p>You can check out the full patch notes below.</p>

      <p>In our Modern Warfare Jim wrote:</p>
      <blockquote>Infinity Ward was never going to recapture the magic of the original Modern Warfare, but this is still their most memorable Call of Duty game of the past decade. This is a bold new spin that’s uneven in places, but proves there is still room for innovation within that core template.</blockquote>
