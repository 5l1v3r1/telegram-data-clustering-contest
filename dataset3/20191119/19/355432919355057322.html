      <h1>Whistleblower lawyer lashes out at Jordan: 'I AM TIRED OF YOU LYING IN A HOUSE COMMITTEE ROOM'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:10:59+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/john-bowden" target="_blank">John Bowden</a></address>
      <p>An attorney representing a whistleblower in the intelligence community who filed an inspector general complaint at the center of the impeachment proceedings lashed out at Rep. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/jim-jordan">Jim Jordan</a> (R-Ohio) on Tuesday, accusing the congressman of lying and spreading conspiracy theories.</p>
      <p>Andrew Bakaj tweeted Tuesday that Jordan had lied about who the unnamed whistleblower had contacted before filing a report with the intelligence community's inspector general.</p>
      <p>"Congressman @Jim_Jordan - I AM TIRED OF YOU LYING IN A HOUSE COMMITTEE ROOM IN FRONT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. My client hired ME - no one else in leading up to filing the disclosure with the ICIG," Bakaj tweeted, referring to the intelligence community inspector general.</p>
      <p>"I have made that clear TIME AND TIME AGAIN - and you ignore the FACTS!" he added.</p>

      <p>A second attorney representing the whistleblower, Mark Zaid, added: "Certain Members of Congress continue to lie abt my role in this case &amp; deliberately distort facts to deflect from addressing #WBer complaint."</p>
      <p>"They didn't treat me this way when I worked w/them re #Benghazi #WBers. #Shameful," he continued, adding "#FactsMatter."</p>

      <p>Republicans including Jordan have accused the whistleblower without evidence of contacting Rep. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/adam-schiff">Adam Schiff</a> (D-Calif.), the chair of the House Intelligence Committee currently leading the House impeachment inquiry, prior to filing his complaint with the inspector general.</p>
      <p>Jordan spent his allotted time during the testimony of Lt. Col. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/alexander-vindman">Alexander Vindman</a> on Tuesday decrying the impeachment process and claiming that Democrats had uncovered no evidence of a quid pro quo related to military aid to Ukraine and an investigation into former Vice President <a href="https://thehill.com/people/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a>.</p>
      <p>"The facts are on the president’s side, the process is certainly not. It has been the most unfair process we have ever seen and the American people understand it," he said Tuesday.</p>
