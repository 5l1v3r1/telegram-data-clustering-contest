        <b>Tottenham have made the bold call to sack Mauricio Pochettino and his coaching staff.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Pochettino led Spurs to top four finishes in four of his five seasons in charge while they reached their first Champions League final last season.</p>
      <p>However, the club has suffered a huge slump in form this season with just five victories so far.</p>
      <p>Spurs are currently 14th in the Premier League table.</p>
      <p>Club chairman Daniel Levy said a change had to be made in the "club's best interests".</p>
      <p>Levy said: "Regrettably domestic results at the end of last season and beginning of this season have been extremely disappointing.</p>
      <p>"It falls to the Board to make the difficult decisions - this one made more so given the many memorable moments we have had with Mauricio and his coaching staff - but we do so in the Club's best interests.</p>
      <p>"Mauricio and his coaching staff will always be part of our history.</p>
      <p>"I have the utmost admiration for the manner in which he dealt with the difficult times away from a home ground whilst we built the new stadium and for the warmth and positivity he brought to us.</p>
      <p>"I should like to thank him and his coaching staff for all they have contributed. They will always be welcome here.</p>
      <p>"We have a talented squad. We need to re-energise and look to deliver a positive season for our supporters."</p>
      <p>Pochettino has previously been heavily linked with Manchester United and Real Madrid, both of whom have managers at the moment.</p>
      <p>It'll probably be a while until Spurs announce his successor but former United manager Jose Mourinho is the bookies favourite.</p>
