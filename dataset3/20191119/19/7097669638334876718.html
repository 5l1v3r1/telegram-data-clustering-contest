      <p>Students are being allowed to retrieve their belongings at a Southern California school where a teen shot five classmates, killing two.</p>
      <p>Classes at Saugus High in Santa Clarita are canceled until Dec. 2. Students were escorted on Tuesday to pick up books, backpacks and other items left behind after gunfire erupted last Thursday.</p>
