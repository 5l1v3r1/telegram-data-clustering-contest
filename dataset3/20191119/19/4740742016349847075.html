      </figure>
      <p>A neighbour is calling for the forced purchase of a <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/southmead">Southmead</a> house reportedly left empty for 19 years and now “in a disgusting state”.</p>
      <p>Rachael Roberts lives next door to the semi-detached home at 86 Ambleside Avenue and believes <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-council">Bristol City Council</a> should make a compulsory purchase order (CPO).</p>
      <p>Foliage appears to be growing inside the three-storey <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/property/">house</a>, and pushing past the net curtain behind the front door’s window.</p>
      <p>Mrs Roberts, 49, said: “The garden is a forest where rats and badgers roam free. The place is in a pretty vile condition.”</p>
      <p>The grandmother-of-six says the house has been abandoned since the woman who owned it died in 2000. She claims she reported it to the council 12 years ago but has never received a response.</p>
      <p>Mrs Roberts questioned why the council is forcing through a purchase of <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/clifton-house-compulsory-purchase-sale-3528745">a house left empty for 16 years in Alma Vale Road</a>, Clifton, but not acting on 86 Ambleside Avenue.</p>

      <p>She said: “My daughter is a mum, and she still lives with me. There are a lot of young families who need homes.</p>
      <p>“I’m not just talking about my children. People everywhere need somewhere to live. Houses shouldn’t be empty.”</p>
      <h3>Our visit to Ambleside Avenue</h3>
      <p>When <i>Bristol Live</i> visited 86 Ambleside Avenue, we found the front yard is overgrown with 7ft-high bushes and strewn with soft drink cans, plastic bottles, wrappers and other litter.</p>
      <p>The paintwork is peeling on the front door and the back garden contains a brick shed with a broken window.</p>
      <p>The back yard appears to have seen years of unchecked growth, with a thick cluster of brambles and trees. The planks of wood in the garden fence are rotting and falling away.</p>
      <p>Mrs Roberts said: “It’s in a disgusting state. The roots from the bushes are clogging up the drains, which is causing flooding on the pavement out the front.</p>

      <p>“Every few years, part of the pavement has to be shut off so the drains can be sorted out.”</p>
      <p>She added she recently had to cut the property’s hedge because she could not see the road from her driveway and was unable to get her car out.</p>
      <p>“I worry about my grandchildren playing in my garden in case the rats are there. Foxes bring their food because the overgrown garden is the perfect place for them to hide with it.”</p>
      <h3>Bristol's empty house problem</h3>

      <p>There are 12,538 people on Bristol City Council’s housing waiting list and 1,377 empty unfurnished properties, according to figures from June.</p>
      <p>In a forced purchase, the council must pay the owner market value and immediately sell the home on to a private buyer, a recent council report says.</p>
      <p>The report shows that of 47 CPO actions begun in the last nine years, 14 reached completion and 24 were dropped after the owner brought the building back into use or agreed to sell the house voluntarily.</p>
      <p>So far, 38 of the 47 properties subject to CPO action since 2010 have been re-occupied.</p>
