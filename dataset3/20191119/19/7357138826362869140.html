      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:59:11+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pymnts.com/author/pymnts/" target="_blank">PYMNTS</a></address>
      <p>Small business online lending platform <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/personnel/2019/paypal-veteran-hired-as-bluevine-cco/">BlueVine</a> announced a $102.5 million funding round and plans to expand its presence in the small and medium-sized business (SMB) banking market.</p>
      <p>In a <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/11/19/1949241/0/en/BlueVine-Raises-102-5-Million-To-Build-Next-Generation-Small-Business-Banking.html">press release</a> Tuesday (Nov. 19), BlueVine revealed ION Crossover Partners led the series F equity financing round, which also saw participation from Lightspeed Venture Partners, Menlo Ventures, 83North, SVB Capital, Nationwide, Citi Ventures, M12 and private investors.</p>
      <p>A series of new investors also participated, the press release said, and include MUFG Innovation Partners, O.G. Tech, Vintage Investment Partners, ION Group, Maor Investments and other private backers.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.pymnts.com/loans/2018/bluevine-ceo-invoice-factoring-smb-lending-small-business-loans/">BlueVine</a> plans to deploy the funding to develop BlueVine Business Banking, an expansion of its small business financing offering. The initiative includes the creation of a banking platform with small business checking account services integrated with BlueVine’s existing SMB financing products. The platform will also connect businesses to the BlueVine Business Debit Mastercard.</p>
      <p>Funding will be used to integrate BlueVine’s invoice factoring, line of credit and term loan products into the banking platform. BlueVine said it also plans to grow its team with a focus on hiring in the engineering, product and revenue departments.</p>
      <p>The company first announced its plans to expand into small business banking in October with the launch of the <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2019/bluevine-adds-checking-accounts-cards-for-small-firms/">BlueVine Checking Account</a>.</p>
      <p>“The recent launch of BlueVine Checking demonstrates our commitment to revolutionize banking for small business owners with a full suite of services designed specifically to meet their unique needs,” said BlueVine CEO and Co-Founder Eyal Lifshitz. “This funding further validates our mission and will help democratize true business-grade banking for small businesses who have been underserved for so long.”</p>
      <p>ION Crossover Partners partner Jonathan Kolodny said there is an “economic need” for BlueVine’s small business banking services.</p>
      <p>“We believe the company is exceptionally well-positioned, thanks to its world-class management team, to change the way small businesses manage their financial needs today and in the future,” he said.</p>
