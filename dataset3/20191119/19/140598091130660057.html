      <h1>Game of Thrones actress Emilia Clarke was told not to disappoint fans when she raised objections to nude scenes</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:15:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/jessica-carpani/" target="_blank">Jessica Carpani</a></address>
      <p> GAME of Thrones actress Emilia Clarke has revealed she was told not to "disappoint fans" when she raised objections to filming nude scenes. </p>
      <p>The London-born actress said she used to cry in the toilets during production for the HBO fantasy series in which she portrayed Daenerys Targaryen.</p>
      <p>Her character, known as the Mother of Dragons, appeared in a variety of sex scenes throughout the programme and admitted she had "fights on sets" regarding nudity.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Dax Shepard on his Armchair Expert podcast, Clarke, 33, spoke about the pressures she felt while filming the first series of the award-winning show. </p>
      <p>She said: “Season one was was a f**k tonne of nudity. "I’m a lot more savvy [now] with what I’m comfortable with, and what I am okay with doing. </p>
      <p>"I’ve had fights on set before where I’m like, "No, the sheet stays up", and they’re like, "You don’t wanna disappoint your Game of Thrones fans". And I’m like, "F*** you."' </p>
      <p>The 33-year-old did not name anyone who urged her to film nude scenes. Clarke had recently graduated from Drama Centre when she was cast in the adaptation of George R R Martin’s fantasy series A Song of Ice and Fire.  </p>
      <p>The show, which first aired in 2011, quickly garnered a reputation for its nudity, swearing, violence and dragons but later faced a backlash over the rape of Sansa Stark in season five. </p>

      <p>Clarke, who is currently promoting her new film, Last Christmas, told Shepard: "I took the job and then they sent me the scripts and I was reading them, and I was, like, 'Oh, there’s the catch!'  Clarke, who said she had only worked on a film set twice before her Game of Thrones role, said she believed that "if it’s in the script then it’s clearly needed".</p>
      <p>She explained: "So I came to terms with that beforehand, but then going in and doing it… I’m floating through this first season and I have no idea what I’m doing, I have no idea what any of this is. </p>
      <p>"I’m now on a film set completely naked with all of these people, and I don’t know what I’m meant to do and I don’t know what’s expected of me, and I don’t know what you want and I don’t know what I want." </p>
      <p>Clarke added she would release her emotion by crying in the toilets before returning to set to finishing her scenes. </p>
      <p>The Me Before You actress said that filming nude scenes with Jason Mamoa, who played Clarke's on-screen husband Khal Drogo for ten episodes of the first season, was "wonderful" as he encouraged her to stand her ground.</p>
      <p>Her final nude scene was in season six when Daenerys emerged from a burning temple that she had set alight, killing those inside it, naked but unharmed. </p>
      <p>Speaking about the scene Clarke said: “When I did the last nudity that I did for the show, which was walking through the fire - second time round - I was like I am owning this. This is mine. They’ve asked me to do it and do you know what I’m f**king game.”</p>
      <p>HBO have been approached for comment.</p>
