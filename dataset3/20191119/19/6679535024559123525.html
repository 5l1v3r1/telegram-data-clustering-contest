      <p>The government has decided to conduct inter-collegiate sports and cultural competitions after a gap of 31 years in the Union Territory, Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy said on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Addressing a press conference along with Education Minister R. Kamalakannan, the Chief Minister said the events would be held in the months of January-February. The event was held last in 1988. A sum of ₹75 lakh has been set aside for the competitions, the Chief Minister said.</p>
      <h3>100 colleges</h3>
      <p>Students of around 100 colleges would be able to showcase their sporting and artistic talents. The first, second and third prize winners would be issued ‘meritorious sports person certificates,’ he also said.</p>
      <p>He also announced the enhancement of welfare assistance to ex-servicemen.</p>
      <p>The financial allowance provided to the ex-servicemen has been enhanced from ₹6,000 to ₹10,000 and the value of Deepavali gift coupon from ₹3,000 to ₹4,000.</p>
      <p>From next year, instead of providing gift coupons, the money would be remitted to their bank accounts.</p>
      <h3>Ex-servicemen to benefit</h3>
      <p>Around 2500 ex-servicemen in the Union Territory would benefit from the government gesture. Cash allowance towards tuition fees of the wards of retired defence personnel has been doubled, the Chief Minister said.</p>
