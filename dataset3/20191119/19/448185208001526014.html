      <p><b>Washington</b><b>:</b> In order to send a message to companies in the US to bring back manufacturing home and create more jobs, US President Donald Trump will visit Apple’s Mac Pro plant in Texas on Wednesday, The White House has confirmed. As part of its commitment to US economic growth, Apple in September confirmed that its newly redesigned Mac Pro will be manufactured in Austin, Texas. The latest generation Mac Pro will be produced at the same facility where Mac Pro has been made since 2013.</p>
      <p>According to a CNBC report on Sunday, the White House confirmed the visit is scheduled to take place on Wednesday. It is likely that Apple CEO Cook would accompany Trump at the plant. Apple has asked for more exemptions on tariffs on Chinese-made Apple Watches, iPods, iPhone components and other consumer products from the US government. The new tariffs took effect in September as part of the US-China trade war.</p>
      <p>The new Mac Pro will include components designed, developed and manufactured by more than a dozen American companies for distribution to US customers. (IANS)</p>
