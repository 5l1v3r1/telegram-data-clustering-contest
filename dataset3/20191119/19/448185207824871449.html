      <p><b>London</b><b>:</b> British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has revealed that every Conservative Party candidate standing in the country’s general election on December 12 has personally pledged to back his Brexit deal. In his first major newspaper interview of the election campaign, Johnson told the Sunday Telegraph that he has asked all 635 of his candidates to sign up to a pledge to back his Brexit Withdrawal Agreement in the House of Commons. “If we get a majority Conservative government, we can deliver and there will be no more wrangling or dither or delay,” Johnson said, Xinhua news agency reported.</p>
      <p>He said he plans to end Britain’s membership of the European Union (EU) in January if he wins a majority that keeps him at 10 Downing Street. “Of course there will be many who voted Remain, many who voted Leave, people with different views, and they will come together to get it done, and come together in the interests of the whole country.” (IANS)</p>
