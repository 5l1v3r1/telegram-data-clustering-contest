      <h1>Advanced Micro Devices Marches Higher on the Charts</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:25:49+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://realmoney.thestreet.com/author/1668375/bruce-kamich/all.html" target="_blank">BRUCE KAMICH</a></address>
      <p>Jim Cramer <a href="https://www.thestreet.com/jim-cramer/you-need-better-tech-cramers-mad-money-recap-nov-18-15172139">mentioned</a> Advanced Micro Devices (<a href="https://realmoney.thestreet.com/quote/AMD.html">AMD</a>) at the top of his <i>Mad Money</i> program Monday night. He noted that stocks like AMD and Nvidia (<a href="https://realmoney.thestreet.com/quote/NVDA.html">NVDA</a>)  saw their shares decline after they reported earnings last week but yesterday they came roaring back as investors again realized how essential these chip stocks are to our future. </p>
      <p>  In this daily bar chart of AMD, below, we can see that a new uptrend got started in early October and prices broke out to new highs this month. AMD is above the rising 50-day moving average line and the rising 200-day line.   The On-Balance-Volume (OBV) line broke out to a new high to confirm the price gains and support the rally as the rising OBV line tells us that buyers of AMD have been more aggressive.   The trend-following Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) oscillator turned outright bullish in October and continues to be strong this month.    </p>

      <p>  In this weekly bar chart of AMD, below, we can see that prices have trended higher since early 2018. Prices are above the rising 40-week moving average line.   The weekly OBV line has made a new high for the move up and the MACD oscillator just crossed to the upside for a fresh outright buy signal.   </p>

      <p>    In this Point and Figure chart of AMD, below, we can see the uptrend in price and a potential longer-term price target in the mid-$60's.    </p>

      <p>  <b>Bottom line strategy:</b> AMD is pointed up but extended on the daily chart. Prices could dip or pullback for a couple of days before resuming their uptrend. Use a dip of one to three days to add to longs. The $65 area is our longer-term price objective.  </p>
