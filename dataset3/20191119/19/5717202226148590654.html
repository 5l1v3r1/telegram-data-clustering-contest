      <h1>Liverpool signing Amine Harit would be disastrous for Xherdan Shaqiri</h1>

      <p>Liverpool are reportedly interested in signing Schalke star Amine Harit.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.corrieredellosport.it/news/calcio/talent-scout/2019/11/18-63487290/amine_harit_applausi_in_bundesliga_con_lo_schalke/">Corriere dello Sport have suggested</a> Jurgen Klopp has sent a scout to watch the talented Morocco international, who has seven caps for his country.</p>
      <p>With five goals and four assists in 13 games in all competitions so far, Harit’s stock is high.</p>

      <p>The ace has previously drawn comparisons to the legendary Zinedine Zidane, and plays with an impressive elegance between the lines of the opposition midfield and defence.</p>
      <p>He is seemingly the next top talent at a club that has given the football world the likes of Mesut Ozil, Julian Draxler, Leroy Sane and Ilkay Gundogan.</p>
      <p>Liverpool’s links are sure to excite fans, but one man might not be too keen about the apparent interest.</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view – The beginning of the end for Shaqiri?</h3>
      <p>If Liverpool went ahead and snapped up the talented Harit, then that would make life very difficult for Xherdan Shaqiri.</p>

      <p>The £80,000-a-week star (<a href="https://www.spotrac.com/epl/liverpool-f.c/payroll/">Spotrac</a>), who trained on Tuesday following a pesky calf injury, has found opportunities hard to come by at Anfield since signing in 2018.</p>
      <p>The Switzerland international favours playing as a number 10, but is often deployed as a right-winger to cut inside on his left foot.</p>
      <p>Harit’s preferred position is central attacking midfielder, but failing that he can play on either wing.</p>
      <p>That would make him direct competition for Shaqiri, whose prospects would surely diminish even further if a deal was done.</p>
