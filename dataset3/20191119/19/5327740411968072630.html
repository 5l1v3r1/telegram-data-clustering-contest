      <p>A South Surrey learning centre is inviting the community to help boost its annual tradition of brightening Christmas for young children.</p>
      <p>Kumon Math and Reading Centre’s toy drive is ongoing until Thursday, Dec. 5.</p>
      <p>Donations of new, unwrapped toys are being collected for donation to the Salvation Army.</p>
      <p>In years past, the drive has been open to Kumon parents, “but we’d love to expand that to the community at large,” the centre’s communications officer, Steven Scott, told <i>Peace Arch News</i> by email.</p>
      <p>Anyone wishing to contribute to this year’s effort may drop off toys to the centre, located at 101B-3237 King George Blvd., between 3-5:30 p.m. Mondays and Wednesdays, or from 3-7 p.m. on Tuesdays and Fridays.</p>
      <p>For more information, call 778-294-7323.</p>
