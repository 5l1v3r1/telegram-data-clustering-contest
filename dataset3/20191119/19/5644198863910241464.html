      <p>SAINT-LEONARD-DE_NOBLAT:Â Former Tour de France winners Bernard Thevenet and Bernard Hinault were among hundreds of mourners who gathered in the village of Saint-Leonard-de-Noblat on Tuesday (Nov 19) for the funeral of Raymond Poulidor, who died last week at the age of 83.</p>
      <p>"We will miss him, that's for sure, there's going to be a big hole in our lives," said Thevenet.</p>

      <p>"He was an intergenerational champion. Known by people who never saw him on a bike."</p>
      <p>Poulidor clinched 189 wins during his career from 1960-1977 but he will always be remembered for the races he failed to win.</p>

      <p>From 1964 to 1976 he finished second in the Tour de France on three occasions and was third five times in an era dominated by Eddy Merckx.</p>
      <p>High points included wins in the Tour of Spain, the Dauphine Libere twice, and the Paris-Nice twice.</p>
      <p>His grandson Mathieu van der Poel, two-time cyclo-cross world champion, accompanied Poulidor's widow Giselle and their two other grandchildren at the funeral service.</p>
