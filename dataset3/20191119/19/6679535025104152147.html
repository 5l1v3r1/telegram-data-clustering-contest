      <p>The Koparkhairane police arrested a 28-year-old man on Monday for allegedly killing his abusive father on November 14. The body of Danaya Kalipilli (49) was found the next morning near the railway tracks along Thane-Belapur Road.</p>
      <p>Senior police inspector Suryakant Jagdale said, “The deceased looked like a worker and we made inquiries in Turbhe MIDC. The accused, Hemaraju Kalipilli, worked as a welder in a factory in the area and his colleagues identified the deceased as he used to work there earlier.”</p>
      <p>Mr. Jagdale said the father was an alcoholic and used to beat up his wife and children. “The accused said he had a traumatic childhood. Six years ago, the father-son duo came to Navi Mumbai from their hometown in Andhra Pradesh for work. Two years ago, the father was fired for coming drunk to work,” Mr Jagdale said.</p>
      <p>On November 14, the accused met his father, who was staying at a friend’s place, and told him to return home. When he refused, a quarrel broke out and Mr. Kalipilli killed his father with a rod. “We arrested the son on the basis of technical evidence. The accused has been remanded in police custody till Saturday,” Mr. Jagdale said.</p>
