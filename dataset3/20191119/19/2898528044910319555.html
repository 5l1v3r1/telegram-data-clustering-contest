      <h1>Dana White excited about ‘very fun fight’ between Weili Zhang, Joanna Jedrzejczyk</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:00</time> by <a rel="author">Damon Martin</a></address>
      <p>UFC strawweight champion Weili Zhang didn’t seem all that interested in a fight against <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/2758/joanna-jedrzejczyk">Joanna Jedrzejczyk</a> a few months ago, but it appears her opinion has changed.</p>
      <p>The reigning queen at 115 pounds responded to recent comments from Jedrzejczyk where she talked about the potential showdown with the title on the line. In the post on Instagram, Weili not only accepted the challenge but she welcomed the former strawweight champion to contact the UFC to make the fight happen.</p>
      <p>“She seems very angry? Don’t worry, she will calm down,” Weili wrote on Instagram. “I am ready now. Call my manager or call <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/2230/dana-white">Dana White</a>. I’m ready.”</p>
      <p>Seeing that fiery answer from Weili then prompted UFC president Dana White to get involved while seemingly touting that as the next strawweight title fight he wants to see.</p>
      <p>“This is going to be a VERY fun fight,” White wrote with a screenshot of the exchange between Weili and Jedrzejczyk.</p>

      <p>Sources close to the situation confirmed that there is legitimate interest from the UFC in booking Weili vs. Jedrzejczyk but nothing has been locked down just yet.</p>
      <p>While an Instagram response is far from an official offer, there’s little doubt that Jedrzejczyk wants the next shot at the champion after she dismantled <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/fighter/1838/michelle-waterson">Michelle Waterson</a> in her most recent performance.</p>
      <p>“I want to be strawweight champ again,” Jedrzejczyk<a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2019/11/10/20932344/joanna-jedrzejczyk-will-eventually-return-to-flyweight-but-i-want-to-be-strawweight-champ-again"> told MMA Fighting</a> following her win in October. “The weight cut went smooth and easy, and I’m very excited to step into the Octagon with Weili Zhang. I’m super excited about that.”</p>
      <p>With Weili seemingly on board as well, the UFC might have a self-made strawweight title fight ready to go for early 2020.</p>
