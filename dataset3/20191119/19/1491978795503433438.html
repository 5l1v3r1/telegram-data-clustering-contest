        <i><b>Wednesday: </b>Swedish prosecutors have dropped investigations into allegations against the WikiLeaks found. Plus, Yael Stone’s year</i>
      </p>
      <p>Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Wednesday 20 November.</p>
      <h3>Top stories</h3>
      <p><b>Swedish authorities have dropped their rape investigation against Julian Assange,</b> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/nov/19/sweden-drops-julian-assange-investigation">noting that the complainant’s evidence was deemed credible and reliable</a>, but that after nearly a decade witnesses’ memories may have faded. After a comprehensive assessment the case against Assange was deemed “not strong enough to form the basis for filing an indictment”, but the Swedish attorney general could yet appeal. The WikiLeaks founder, who is still battling extradition to the US, has been facing possible charges in Sweden since 2010.</p>
      <p><b>The author who triggered a stunning police crackdown on a mystery prisoner in a Canberra jail has hit out at the secrecy surrounding the man’s imprisonment.</b> A former military intelligence officer was prosecuted, convicted and jailed in the ACT last year, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/20/author-who-tried-to-help-mystery-prisoner-publish-memoir-hits-out-at-secret-trials">in a process </a><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/20/author-who-tried-to-help-mystery-prisoner-publish-memoir-hits-out-at-secret-trials">hidden from public scrutiny</a>. The author, Robert Macklin, attempted to publish the man’s memoirs on his time in prison, which sparked police raids of the inmate’s cell and his brother’s home. “I didn’t think we had secret trials in Australia,” Macklin said. “It worries me that we do.” The former ACT chief minister Jon Stanhope compared the case to those prosecuted under totalitarian regimes, saying “not even the media was aware that this trial had occurred”.</p>
      <p><b>Food delivery bike couriers are being underpaid by up to $322 a week</b>,<b> </b>according to figures from union researchers, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/nov/20/food-delivery-bike-couriers-in-australia-being-underpaid-by-up-to-322-a-week">compared with minimum rates of pay and superannuation in the transport award</a>. A survey of more than 240 riders revealed that almost all had no minimum rates of pay, and were paid per delivery on a “take-it-or-leave-it” basis. As independent contractors, riders for companies like Deliveroo are not paid the award minimum wage, and miss out on weekend penalty rates and superannuation. An unfair dismissal case before the Fair Work Commission began on Monday seeking to prove that Uber Eats drivers are in fact employees.</p>

      <p><b>After seven seasons as Lorna Morello in the hit series Orange Is the New Black, Yael Stone is back in Australia. </b>It’s been a big year for the actor – she’s become a mother, spoken out against Geoffrey Rush and been swept up in the #MeToo movement, and started studying sustainability. From the “unhealthy horseshit” of Instagram, to the importance of Safe Theatres, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/nov/20/yael-stone-on-a-year-of-growth-i-dont-want-to-be-anybodys-plaything-again">Stone talks to Brigid Delaney</a> about growing up, being “more like me” and rejecting being considered as “anybody’s plaything”.</p>
      <p><b>Fewer than one in five Australians want to see Donald Trump re-elected as president.</b> So why does Scott Morrison risk alienating voters by stridently defending the divisive statesman? “However debased America’s polity may currently be, the other powers to which we might turn for sponsorship in an increasingly unstable world are openly authoritarian,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/nov/19/why-scott-morrison-is-so-determined-to-suck-up-to-donald-trump-faith-loyalty-sacrifice">Jason Wilson writes</a>. But would the relationship suffer significantly if Australia’s leaders adopted a less enthusiastic posture? Trump’s “entire personal history suggests that he is unlikely to be meaningfully grateful for any loyalty shown him”.</p>
