        <li>Last year, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/google">Google</a> moved into the historic Spruce Goose aeroplane hangar in LA.</li>
        <li>The Spruce Goose was the largest wood plane ever built, and flew only once, in 1947.</li>
        <li>Google restored the hangar into a 450,000-square-foot office and event space, preserving the original construction and adding to the interior, creating an unusual mix of old and new.</li>

      <p>Google combined its two LA offices into a historic aeroplane hangar last year, and the results are nothing short of stunning.</p>
      <p>The hangar, which once held the famed <a href="https://www.evergreenmuseum.org/the-spruce-goose">Spruce Goose plane</a>, as it was derisively called, has been out of use for years. The Spruce Goose was the largest wooden plane ever built, due to wartime shortages during World War II. It flew just once, for under a minute, in 1947. It was once owned by filmmaker and pilot Howard Hughes, who also helped design the plane.</p>
      <p>Now, the hangar where the Spruce Goose was kept for over 30 years has a second life as Google’s LA office. Google worked with <a href="https://www.zgf.com/">sustainable architecture firm ZGF</a> to create a design that feels new and classic all at once. Take a look:</p>

      <h3>The hangar that was once home to the Spruce Goose had been mostly unoccupied until Google took over and renovated the space.</h3>
