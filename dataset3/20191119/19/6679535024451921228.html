      <h1>40 out of 46 toll plazas FASTag compliant in State: NHAI</h1>
      <h2>Pay double the toll fee if you enter ETC lane without FASTag from December 1</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:25:30+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Anil-Kumar-Sastry-909/" target="_blank">Anil Kumar Sastry</a></address>
      <p>As the December 1 deadline approaches for transition to compulsory FASTag system, the Karnataka regional office of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) says that 34 plazas and and 406 lanes (of 40 plazas and 449 lanes) have already been made compliant.</p>
      <p>Come December 1, vehicle drivers will have to pay double the toll fee if they enter a National Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) System lane at any toll plaza on the National Highway across the State without FASTag [with passive Radio Frequency Identification technology].</p>
      <p>Regional Officer Suryavamshi told <i>The Hindu</i> the work is under way in six plazas, which were recently added to the NHAI fold.</p>
      <p>All lanes of toll plazas are being made ETC lanes, except one on each direction that is called hybrid lane. The hybrid lane, though meant for VIP vehicles, ambulances and oversized vehicles, would also accept toll in FASTag as well as conventional method — cash and cards — but one may have to wait longer to cross these lanes.</p>
      <p>The November 21, 2014 notification by the Union Ministry of Road Transport and Highways that made FASTag mandatory for all vehicles from an appointed date, also prescribes that vehicles entering FASTag lane without having the tag would have to pay double the fee prescribed for that category.</p>
      <p>Though the monthly pass system for local vehicles will continue, the user has to buy a FASTag and get the same synchronised with the toll plaza concerned to avail uninterrupted journeys, Mr. Suryavamshi said. A cash rebate of 2.5% is also available while buying/recharging FASTag from banks concerned, he added.</p>
      <p>Where to buy</p>
      <p>FASTags are available at over 28,500 point of sale locations set up by various banks and NHAI/ Indian Highways Management Company Ltd., (IHMCL), including all toll plazas, RTOs, common service centres, transport hubs, and bank branches. Private vehicle owners may also buy online on Amazon as well as on websites of participating banks [visit www.ihmcl.com for details].</p>
      <p>Besides banks, FASTag can also be recharged by downloading My FASTag app.</p>
