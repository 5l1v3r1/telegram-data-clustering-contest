      <p>HBO has released a new promo for the upcoming <b><a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/his-dark-materials">His Dark Materials</a> </b>Episode 4. After escaping from the clutches of Mrs. Coulter, Lyra makes it to the North. Now she must find someone — or something — who is willing to fight by her side. And what’s better than an armoured bear? The synopsis of “Armour” reads as follows:</p>
      <p>“Lyra and the Gyptians arrive in the North and seek the help of the Witches’ Consul, Texan aeronaut Lee Scoresby and an armoured bear in service to the town.”</p>
      <p>Otto Bathurst directed the episode written by Jack Thorne. You can watch the new <b>His Dark Materials </b>Episode 4 promo in the player below.</p>
