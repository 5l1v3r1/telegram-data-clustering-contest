      <h1>Italy U21 boss Paolo Nicolato praises ‘perfect’ Everton striker Moise Kean</h1>

      <p>Everton striker Moise Kean has had a tough start to life at Goodison Park, but has come in for praise from Italy’s U21 manager Paolo Nicolato.</p>
      <p>The summer signing from Juventus has struggled to live up to expectation so far on Merseyside, and there has been a lot of talk about what might happen with him in January.</p>
      <p>He is without a goal in his 11 appearances for the club so far, and clubs such as AC Milan (<a href="https://www.calciomercato.com/news/milan-torna-l-idea-kean-per-gennaio-contatto-con-raiola-la-situa-34490">Calciomercato</a>), AC Roma and Sampdoria have all be linked with a January move.</p>

      <p>Kean was recently reprimanded for being late to a team meeting – his second offense since being at the club.</p>
      <p>But Nicolato has moved to reassure Toffees fans about Kean’s current state.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.football-italia.net/146597/nicolato-kean-perfect-u21s">He told Football Italia</a>: “At his age it’s not easy with this pressure. He was perfect over the last few days. It is not easy to manage all this interest, this pressure. But within the group he is doing well.”</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view – Kean needs to be shown love</h3>
      <p>Kean needs Marco Silva’s trust and support to help get him out of his rut at Everton.</p>

      <p>The star has arrived with a big price tag, and has been benched too often and played out of position by his manager.</p>
      <p>Surely for Everton fans to see the best of him, the teenager needs a show of faith from Silva. He needs to be trying to elevate the pressure on him not adding to it.</p>
