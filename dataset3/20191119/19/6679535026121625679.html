      <p>The High Court has rightly rapped the Tamil Nadu government for its decision to release six convicts undergoing life imprisonment for the gruesome killing of six Dalits in Melavalavu in 1997. (Editorial, “Wrong signals,” Nov. 19). Considering the fact that this was a case where the casteist overtones in the crime appeared to be crystal clear, the government should have applied its mind a little more before arriving at the decision to release the convicts. While the government has the prerogative to effect such releases, the gravity of the case and the heinousness of the crime should have weighed over factors such as the longevity of the jail term and the good conduct of the prisoners.</p>
