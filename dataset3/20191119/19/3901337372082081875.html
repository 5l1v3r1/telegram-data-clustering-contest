      <p>Lerato ‘Ace’ Chabangu is showing signs of hunger for competitive football again, as well as willingness to grab his chance, after being given another lifeline by Baberwa FC in the ABC Motsepe League. </p>
      <p>The former Mamelodi Sundowns and Bafana Bafana star was signed by the third tier league outfit at the beginning of the year in an attempt to help him to revive his career. </p>

      <p>However, reports of him going AWOL surfaced in the football fraternity at the start of the current season. </p>
      <p>It was later confirmed in the media from Baberwa that the player eventually returned to the club after his two-week absence. </p>
      <p>Prior to last weekend’s match against M Tigers, Baberwa confirmed that Chabangu was finally declared fit for competitive football for the first time this season.  </p>

      <p>The 34-year-old was included in the match-day squad, though he was an unused substitute.</p>
      <p>"The technical team has confirmed that for the first time this season Lerato “All You Need Is Love” Chabangu is fully fit and will be in the 18-man squad for tomorrow’s game against M. Tigers FC at Mehlareng Stadium in Tembisa," Baberwa confirmed on Twitter. </p>

      <p>Chabangu previously also played for SuperSport United, Chippa United and Moroka Swallows, among other clubs in his career.</p>
      <p>The Tembisa-born player has no intentions of hanging up his boots just yet as he remains hopeful of another chance in professional football. </p>
