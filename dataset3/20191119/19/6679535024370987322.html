      <h1>Security guard held for beating stray dog to death</h1>
      <h2>Complaint filed by poet’s daughter</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:56:08+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Supriti-David-116452/" target="_blank">Supriti David</a></address>
      <p>The Juhu police on Tuesday arrested a security guard of a housing society for allegedly beating a disabled stray dog to death earlier this month.</p>
      <p>The complaint was filed by Mitul Pradeep, daughter of the legendary poet Kavi Pradeep.</p>
      <p>Born Ramchandra Dwivedi, Kavi Pradeep is best known for his patriotic song <i>Aye Mere Watan Ke Logon</i>, immortalised by singer Lata Mangeshkar, and sung so movingly that it is said to have left former Indian prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru in tears. Kavi Pradeep passed away in 1998 and is survived by his two daughters, Sargam Thaker and Mitul Pradeep.</p>
      <h3>Society’s own dog</h3>
      <p>Ms. Pradeep told <i>The Hindu</i> that the dog, lovingly called Langdu, had been staying on the premises of Shivam Housing Society in Juhu for the past 10 years. On November 8, a resident of the building called up Ms. Pradeep to inform her that Langdu had been beaten and was severely injured.</p>
      <p>“I visited the society on November 9 and saw that he was indeed in a very bad condition, after which we took him to a hospital run by an NGO. Langdu succumbed to his injuries on November 13,” she said.</p>
      <p>On approaching the police, Ms. Pradeep was told that they needed more evidence to conduct inquiries. “I went back to the society and confronted the watchman, who confessed. I recorded his confession and submitted it to the police on Tuesday,” she said.</p>
      <p>The police confirmed that the watchman was then booked for killing an animal under the Indian Penal Code and arrested.</p>
      <p>Ms. Pradeep is organising a silent vigil on Sunday to demand justice for Langdu, which will be held at 6 p.m. on Sunday opposite Golden Tobacco company on SV Road in Vile Parle.</p>
