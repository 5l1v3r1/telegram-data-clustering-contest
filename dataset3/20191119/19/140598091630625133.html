      <h1>Malta arrests man suspected of being middleman in murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:32:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/nick-squires/" target="_blank">Nick Squires</a></address>
      <p>Malta has arrested a man who claims to have information about the mastermind who ordered the assassination of investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia two years ago.</p>
      <p>In what could be a major breakthrough in the case, the arrested man has said he will divulge the names of those responsible on condition that he is granted a pardon for any role he played in the plot and for other crimes.</p>
      <p>Joseph Muscat, Malta’s prime minister, said he would recommend a pardon be granted if the evidence given by the man is corroborated by investigators.</p>
      <p>The 53-year-old journalist, whose blog about corruption and sleaze was widely followed and upset numerous businessmen and politicians, was blown up by a car bomb as she left her home in the village of Bidnija in October 2017.</p>
      <p>Three men suspected of having carried out the car bombing were arrested two months later. They are still awaiting trial. But the identity of the person or people who commissioned the hit has remained a mystery.</p>

      <p>The alleged middleman was arrested last Thursday as part of an investigation into money laundering.</p>
      <p>He is suspected of having acted as the intermediary between the three men who carried out the bombing and the person or people who commissioned it.</p>
      <p>He was named by the Maltese press as Melvin Theuma, a taxi driver who has been accused in the past of involvement in loan sharking. He reportedly fears for his safety if he ends up in prison.</p>
      <p>“This is an important development and is likely to lead to those who ordered the assassination,” Manuel Delia, an expert on the case and the author of a new book about the killing, <i>Murder on the Malta Express</i>, told <i>The Telegraph</i>.</p>
      <p>“We’ve been expecting this for some time. The name of this person was indicated to police by one of the three men who have been charged with Daphne’s murder.”</p>
      <p>The prime minister, speaking on the steps leading to his office in the capital, Valletta, said: “I promised I will leave no stone unturned (when Caruana Galizia was killed) and there will be no impunity to anyone, whoever he is.”</p>
      <p>Adrian Delia, the leader of the opposition Nationalist Party, said the government should “make use of all procedures and means at hand within the law, even those exceptional ones, in order to catch who ordered, financed, and executed the assassination of Daphne Caruana Galizia.”</p>
