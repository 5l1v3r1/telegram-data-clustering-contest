      <h2>Residents claim 15 incidents over 3 days, but police receive just 3 complaints</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:36:51+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Dhairya-Gajara-91151/" target="_blank">Dhairya Gajara</a></address>
      <p>Residents and shopkeepers of Immaculate Conception (I.C.) Colony in Borivali have been victims of a spate of burglaries at night. Though residents have claimed that there have been 15 incidents over the past three days, the police say they have only received three complaints so far.</p>
      <p>Residents told <i>The Hindu </i>on Tuesday that a wide range of establishments — supermarkets, bakeries, salons, bars, stationery shops and food outlets — have been targeted. While in some incidents, cash was stolen from a fast food joint and an ice cream store in the colony, the burglars were only able to flee with four cans of Red Bull from a Monginis outlet on Tuesday morning.</p>
      <p>Jayesh Patel, owner of Daily Needs supermarket and Shree Dhaam Sweets, said the burglars tried to break into both his shops but were unable to do so due to the strong quality of his locks. “They broke open the deep-freeze refrigerators lying outside both the shops and took around ₹30,000 worth of containers of branded ice cream. They also broke the outer glass of the soft drinks refrigerator, but could not break the inner one,” Mr. Patel said.</p>
      <p>Madanlal Chaudhary, a stationery store owner, said his store was targeted in the early hours of Monday. He said, “I got a call from an acquaintance who saw my shop lying open and in disarray. The burglars had broken the locks on the window and took over ₹6,000 in cash, along with my Aadhaar card, PAN card and bank documents.”</p>
      <p>Michelle Robert, owner of Salon Michelle, said, “My salon was broken into but nothing was stolen. After seeing the CCTV feed, my staff recognised the thieves as the same men who were seen sitting outside the salon a couple of days ago.”</p>
      <p>The residents also alleged that the MHB Colony police did not entertain many of their complaints till former corporator Abhishek Ghosalkar intervened in the matter. “I was approached by the shopkeepers on Monday about the issue. I.C. Colony has a high crime rate and I have been requesting the police to set up a beat chowky in the area for the last five years,” Mr. Ghosalkar said.</p>
      <p>Dr. Mohan Dahikar, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone 11), said while they have information about 15 shops being targeted, not all the owners have filed complaints. The highest amount stolen so far, according to police records, is ₹1.86 lakh in cash from Rudrakshi Bar in Yogi Nagar. Rajesh Naidu, who owns the bar, confirmed that his establishment had been broken into, but refused to comment further.</p>
      <p>Dr. Dahikar said, “We will look into the allegations of the personnel at MHB Colony police station not entertaining the complaints and take appropriate action.”</p>
