      <p>Tottenham have announced they have sacked manager Mauricio Pochettino with the ArgentinianÂ relieved of his duties after five-and-a-half years in charge and <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/19/exclusive-jose-mourinho-eyes-tottenham-job-following-mauricio/">Jose Mourinho a frontrunner to take over.</a></p>
      <p>Spurs, who were in the Champions League final only six months ago, have endured a tough start to the season and are currently 14th in the Premier League table.</p>
      <p>Chairman Daniel Levy, who appointed Pochettino in June 2014, said: "We were extremely reluctant to make this change and it is not a decision the board have taken lightly, nor in haste.</p>
      <p>"Regrettably domestic results at the end of last season and the beginning of this season have been extremely disappointing.</p>
      <p>"It falls on the board to make the difficult decisions - this one made more so given the many memorable moments we have had with Mauricio and his coaching staff - but we do so in the club's best interests."</p>
      <p>Pochettino was at the helm for 293 games and delivered four successive top-four Premier League finishes, challenging for the title in 2015/16 and 2016/17. He also memorably guided the club to their first Champions League final last season, but they fell short in the Madrid showpiece in a 2-0 defeat to Liverpool.</p>
      <p>Lineker said on Twitter: "He helped the club to punch massively above their weight for years. Good luck with finding a better replacement....ain't gonna happen."</p>

      <p>Former Tottenham midfielder Jermaine Jenas also came out in support of the former manager, tweeting: "Shoulda backed him not sacked him! Gutted for Mauricio."</p>
      <p>Former England midfielder Trevor Sinclair blamed Totteham's players for letting their manager down, tweeting: "Tottenham players need to have a look at themselves in the mirror tonight after what Poch has done for them #Pochettino."</p>
      <p>Former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher backed Pochettino to be back managing in the Premier League soon.</p>
      <p>He tweeted: "I said a few weeks ago I felt this project had ran its course, I thought there would be a change at the end of the season with either the manager or players changing. Pochettino has been a brilliant manager for Spurs &amp; will be back in the PL sooner rather than later!."</p>
