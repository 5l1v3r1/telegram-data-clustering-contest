      <p>The first day of action at the ISSF World Cup Finals in the city of Putian, China, saw three Indian shooters in action - <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/anjum-moudgil">Anjum Moudgil</a>, <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/sanjeev-rajput">Sanjeev Rajput</a> and <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/akhil-sheoran">Akhil Sheoran</a>. Unfortunately, the trio crashed out of the competition failing to make it past the qualifying round.</p>
      <p>Sanjeev Rajput was the first shooter in action in the Men's 50-metre Rifle 3 positions event in the usual order beginning with the kneeling position followed by the prone position and rounding off the event with the standing position. Rajput, who has secured his quota for the Tokyo Olympics making it his third Olympics in a row, began well with a 384 score in the kneeling position.</p>
      <p>He improved his shooting to a 388 score in the prone round, however, he fell short of the final eight qualification spot by a single point clocking 381 in the standing round. His final total score stood at 1153 as he finished ninth with two competitors above him ending with a score of 1154.</p>
      <p>Fellow Indian shooter Akhil Sheoran was also a part of the fifteen shooters gunning for the qualification to the final round. Sheoran started off fairly well in the kneeling position round with a score of 381 and topped off the prone round with a 388 score. However, the standing position proved to be his undoing as he only managed a score of 378, falling all the way down to the 13th spot in the qualification rankings with his total score of 1147.</p>
      <p>Akhil Sheoran is yet to make the cut for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo and will aim to improvise his performance to stand a chance for the marquee quadrennial event.</p>
      <p>The final shooter in action on Day 1 was star Indian shooter Anjum Moudgil who was a part of the Women's 50-metre Rifle 3 positions event. Moudgil is also one of the Indian shooters who has secured her position at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.</p>
      <p>Moudgil started on a weak note with a score of 377 in the kneeling position round but picked it up to follow up with a strong 390 in the prone position. Her standing round score of 380 meant she finished outside of the qualification positions at the thirteenth position.</p>
      <p>The second-day action continues on Thursday at the ISSF World Cup Finals in Putian, China as more Indian shooters in the fray for a shot at glory.</p>
