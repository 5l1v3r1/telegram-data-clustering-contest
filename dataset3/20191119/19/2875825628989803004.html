      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity</a> star <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/kate-garraway">Kate Garraway</a> once confessed that she forces herself to have sex every single day.</p>
      <p>And she even keeps a spreadsheet to track her action between the sheets.</p>
      <p>The Good Morning Britain star detailed the way she manages her intimate moments with husband Derek Draper in her book The Joy Of Big Knickers.</p>
      <p>She also said in her book that she and Derek, who tied the knot in 2005, once took on a 14-day sex challenge.</p>
      <p>The 52-year-old told <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/">The Sun</a> : "When you've been in a relationship for a long time, the physical side of things can be very unspontaneous.</p>

      <p>"So the idea is to schedule sex and force yourself to do it once a day and make it the focus of your diary."</p>
      <p>Kate says she and her hubby created a spreadsheet so they could record their romps and ensure they were making the most of their intimate times, bragging that they got "very organised".</p>
      <p>She said their sex lives had changed as they got older.</p>
      <p>She said: "When you're younger you want to be impressive, but when you get older, I think there's a different kind of intimacy."</p>

      <p>However, if Kate does well in the jungle she could be forced to go for weeks without her daily romps, meaning she'll have a lot of catching up to do when she gets home.</p>
      <p>The presenter was seen on last night's show taking on the first Bushtucker Trial alongside Caitlyn Jenner.</p>
      <p>In Bugged Off, they were both encased in plastic boxes and hoisted in the air.</p>
      <p>They were tasked with throwing plastic balls into a moving target below them, while being joined in the boxes by countless critters.</p>

      <p>They both managed to get two balls on target, and afterwards, the main camp were given the chance to take one of them in, sending the other back to live on rice and beans in Snake Rock.</p>
      <p>The camp chose Kate, sending her off to live in luxury, where she was horrified to hear that they'd had so much food the night before they couldn't eat it all.</p>
      <p>* I'm A Celebrity airs nightly at 9pm on ITV</p>
