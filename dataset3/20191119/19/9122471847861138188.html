      <h1>Report: NFL Has Discussed Playing Game At Alabama, Notre Dame</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:32:24+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>College football teams play at professional stadiums all the time, but might we see the opposite become reality soon? A new report indicates it is a possibility.</p>
      <p>The NFL is toying with expanding its regular season schedule to 17 games in the future. If that happens, each team would get a second bye week and play at 17th game out of market.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/how-17-game-season-would-work-in-proposed-cba-with-vote-expected-after-the-2019-season/">CBS Sports’ Jason La Canfora</a>, the NFL is considering not only playing some out of market games in additional foreign locations, but also potentially scheduling games in U.S. cities without professional teams.</p>
      <p>If that happens, places like Alabama and Notre Dame could host games.</p>
      <blockquote>The NFL has also talked internally about playing games in other cities in the U.S. which do not have pro teams, with some buzz about playing a game at Notre Dame or Alabama, as well as Hawaii and cities in Canada. It is viewed as a unique and profound way to grow the game globally and extend the reach of sales, merchandising and broadcast rights around the globe, with there only so much more room for growth within America.</blockquote>
      <p>We have to admit, we’re skeptical if adding a 17th game is a good idea, considering how it might affect player safety.</p>
      <p>But if this plan La Canfora hints at becomes reality, imagine the Dallas Cowboys and Green Bay Packers playing at Notre Dame Stadium or Patriots playing a game in Tuscaloosa. Not gonna lie, that would be pretty cool.</p>
      <p>What other college stadiums would you want to see utilized?</p>
