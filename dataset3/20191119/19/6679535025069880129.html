      <h1>IFFK on a tight budget this year too</h1>
      <h2>The budget for the 2019 edition of the film festival has been fixed at around ₹4 crore</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:43:31+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:43</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/S-R-Praveen-926/" target="_blank">S.R. Praveen</a></address>
      <p>For the second successive year, the Kerala State Chalachitra Academy will be working on a tight budget for organising the International Film Festival of Kerala (IFFK).</p>
      <p>In the years before, the academy had a bigger room for manoeuvre with a budget of around ₹6 crore.</p>
      <h3>Floods</h3>
      <p>But, following last year’s unprecedented flood, the academy had to drastically cut down costs.</p>
      <p>With the money gained from the increased delegate fee, last year’s festival was organised at a cost of ₹3.5 crore. According to academy officials, the budget for this year has been fixed at around ₹4crore.</p>
      <h3>Centre blamed</h3>
      <p>The State government is also not in a position to spend more, due to the financial crunch being experienced now.</p>
      <p>Finance Minister Thomas Isaac had this week blamed the Centre for not releasing the State’s share of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) dues of ₹1,600 crore.</p>
      <h3>Screening fee</h3>
      <p>“One of our major spendings will be for the screening fee of the movies in various sections. An amount of around ₹60 lakh is expected to be spent on this. The prices of some of the movies go up to as much as 1000 euros. There are also restrictions on the number of screenings. But, we have not avoided any film just because of the cost,” says an academy official.</p>
      <h3>Fund crunch</h3>
      <p>The fund constraints have also made the academy choose most of the jury members from within Asia, with an eye on the airfare.</p>
      <p>IFFK Lifetime Achievement Award winner Fernando Solanas will be flying in from Argentina.</p>
      <p>Other than them, there are only a limited number of guests.</p>
      <p>The film festival is back to being an eight-day affair again.</p>
      <p>Last year, the duration of the festival was reduced by one day, as the number of films to be screened were less too.</p>
      <p>Short of funds, the academy had last year announced a slew of measures to cut down on spendings, like dropping the daily bulletin and the festival booklet or limiting them just to the online editions.</p>
      <p>But groups of film buffs volunteered for the work and the booklet and bulletin were brought out as usual.</p>
