      <h1>Alabama vs. Furman: Underdog Paladins can win outright</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:00:19+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:00</time> by <a rel="author">Greg Peterson, VSiN</a></address>
      <p>Since the 2014-15 season began, the best against-the-spread team has been the Furman Paladins. In this span, they are 89-50-1 against the number as they hit the road Tuesday to play a new-look Alabama team that is not off to a solid start.</p>
      <p>The Crimson Tide rank 302nd in the country in points per game allowed with 77.7, but are 155th in defensive efficiency, which is points allowed on a per-possession basis. This means Alabama is trying to play much faster, which makes sense with new coach Nate Oats coming in from Buffalo.</p>
      <p>Furman entered Monday ranked 13th in the country in points scored per possession, thanks to 64.9 percent accuracy on 2-point shots. Alabama rates 261st in 2-point shooting percentage on defense.</p>
      <p>The Paladins are built around a pair of forwards in Noah Gurley and Clay Mounce who both are averaging at least 15.8 points and 5.8 rebounds per game.</p>
      <p>That duo should allow Furman to stay within the number, and the Paladins are a threat to defeat an Alabama team thatâ€™s having a tough time transitioning to its new fast pace.</p>
      <p><b>The Play:</b> Furman, +4.</p>
