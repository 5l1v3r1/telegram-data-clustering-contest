      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:22:51+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.magneticmag.com/author/daniel-day/" target="_blank">Daniel Day</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.magneticmag.com/tag/nghtmre/">NGHTMRE</a> and <a href="https://www.magneticmag.com/tag/gunna/">Gunna</a> have pitched their undeniable talents this week for a brand new single. Out now to get fully immersed in is “Cash Cow,” a banging offering that follows a string of high-profile collaborations for NGHTMRE.</p>
      <p>The Atlanta rapper, songwriter and singer Gunna lends his explosive energy well to the melodic rap backdrop that soon takes off. Slick bars highlight the crisp, percussive attention to detail in NGHTMRE’s production, while hits of guitar and drifting trails of riffs complete this sound with style.  </p>
      <p>It’s time to turn up the heat with “Cash Cow.” Play it now. </p>
