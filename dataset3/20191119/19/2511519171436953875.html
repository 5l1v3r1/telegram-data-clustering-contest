      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/wales-football">Wales</a> host <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/hungary-football">Hungary</a>knowing a victory will secure their spot at next summer's European Championships.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/GarethBale">Gareth Bale</a> and Aaron Ramsey are both set to start after passing late fitness tests, leaving manager Ryan Giggs with a full-strength squad at his disposal.</p>
      <p>Wales were defeated in the reverse fixture in June leaving their hopes of qualification hanging by a threat, however, Giggs' side have since gone on an impressive unbeaten run to swing their fortunes.</p>
      <p>Wales will desperately be hoping to avoid a repeat of their dramatic loss to Ireland in their final qualifier for the 2018 World Cup. However, if they do fail to win tonight, they will still have the chance to qualify for the Euros via the playoffs.</p>
