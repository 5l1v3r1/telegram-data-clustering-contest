      <p>The brand promises that glare, which happens when light hits a smooth, reflective surface, will be a thing in the past with its lenses with polarized filters. The lenses offer crisp visual experience with more natural and vivid colors, with a perfect amount of contrast, accurate detail perception, and better depth perception. </p>
      <p>Polar lenses also have an anti-scratch coating as well as oil- and water-resistant coating to enhance each pair’s durability. They also feature a UVA, UVB, and UVC protection filter perfect for those who love to explore.</p>
      <p>It also offers a variety of frames and lenses in different tints and colors, as well as bold frame shapes and sizes—from the famous aviators to eccentric hexagons. </p>
      <p>Polar is available at Sarabia Optical nationwide. </p>
