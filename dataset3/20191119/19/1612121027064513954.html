      <p>Huawei’s <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/344269-huawei-mate-30-pro-emui-google/">Mate 30 Pro has been officially unveiled</a> and released, although it’s struggling to hit mass global availability. Much of that is likely due to the trade ban with the US, restricting Huawei’s access to certain hardware and software.</p>
      <p>But even with that ban in place, the company is gearing up to release their next flagship, the <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/338612-huaweis-p30-pro-is-announced-with-a-set-of-excellent-cameras-and-a-tiny-notch/">Huawei P40</a> Pro, and it’s on track for its usual release date, too. The P-series devices typically get an announcement in March, and internally Huawei is confident with that window.</p>
      <p>The trade ban would still be in effect by then, so maybe Huawei has something planned to get that sorted out first. Otherwise we’ll end up with another <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/344735-huawei-mate-30-pro-lz-play-google-apps/">Mate 30 Pro situation</a> where the phone launches without the Play Store and really hampers its ability to compete on the global stage. China’s release should be completely unaffected either way.</p>
      <p>We’re expecting the Huawei P40 Pro to sport the company’s <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/343847-huawei-990-5g-ifa-2019/">newer Kirin 990 CPU</a> with 5G compatibility, plus even more improvements to the camera. Huawei’s Mate 30 Pro has a stellar camera setup, and with how much R&amp;D Huawei <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/344672-huawei-kirin-1000-leak/">spends on their photography division</a> I expect we’ll see that trend continue at least for another few years.</p>
