      <p>BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil’s government leader in the Senate, Fernando Bezerra, said on Tuesday that ‘administrative reform’, a plank of the Economy Ministry’s far-reaching legislative agenda, may be pushed back to next year.</p>
      <p>The bill, aimed at curbing growth in mandatory federal expenditure by changing the rules for new public sector employees, was due to be unveiled this week, before President Jair Bolsonaro said on Monday that it would likely be delayed.</p>
