      <p>Pablo Hernandez has signed a two-year contract extension with Championship promotion challengers Leeds United.</p>
      <p>The winger is now tied to the Leeds until the end of the 2021-22 season.</p>
      <p>Hernandez initially arrived at Elland Road on loan from Al-Arabi in August 2016 before signing permanently the following January.</p>
      <p>Named Leeds' Player of the Year in each of his two full seasons as a permanent member of the squad, Hernandez scored 12 goals and laid on the same number of assists last term.</p>
      <p>His outstanding campaign was not enough to prevent Leeds from suffering agony in the play-offs, though, as they missed out on promotion.</p>
      <p>Hernandez has scored two league goals and assisted as many this term, with Leeds again challenging for a return to the Premier League. Marcelo Bielsa's men are third in the Championship, two points behind leaders West Brom.</p>
