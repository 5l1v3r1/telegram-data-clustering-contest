      <p>Mysterious rolls of cash keep showing up on sidewalks in the small English village of Blackhall Colliery, on the North Sea coast of County Durham. In the last 5 years, around US$30,000 has been found in twelve rolls. Well, twelve rolls that the finders turned in to police anyway. From <a href="https://www.9news.com.au/world/blackhall-colliery-bundles-of-cash-lost-money-county-durham-police-uk-news/ab68adf4-c95f-443e-a5e0-862f5ce1a8f9?utm_source=fark&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_content=link&amp;ICID=ref_fark">9News</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>"These bundles are always left in plain sight such as on pavements and discovered by random members of the public who have handed them in," Detective Constable John Forster said.<br/><br/>"I have looked into it and I am not thinking crime, drug dealing or money laundering. Drug dealers are not known for being reckless with their money."</blockquote>
