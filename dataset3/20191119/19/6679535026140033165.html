      <p>Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s success in the presidential elections in Sri Lanka marks the return of the Rajapaksa family to power after about four years in the wilderness. Mr. Gotabaya’s nationalist campaign, with a promise of security and a vow to crush religious extremism, found favour with the Sinhalese majority in the country but his victory will be a concern for Sri Lanka's Tamil and Muslim minorities who voted against him. While Prime Minister Narendra Modi lost no time in greeting him and offering an invitation to him to visit India, it will be a tall order to dissociate the island nation from its pro-China tilt (Op-Ed page, “An elusive reconciliation in Sri Lanka,” Nov. 19).</p>
