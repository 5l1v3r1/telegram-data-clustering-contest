      <blockquote>"This is a once in a generation election. So it's welcome that Boris Johnson has accepted our challenge of a head-to-head TV debate...The choice could not be clearer: Boris Johnson's Conservatives protecting the privileged few or a Labour government on the side of the many."</blockquote>

      <h4>FX implications: </h4>
      <p>With respect to the pound, considering the lack of liquidity, there could be some movement depending n what is said and how much of the debate is related to Brexit. However, as analysts at TD Securities explained, "Leaders' debates are rarely decisive events, but in such an unpredictable general election, we'll be watching extra closely for any potential turning points." GBP/USD had ben as high as 1.2970 on the day but has given back some ground to the lowest point in the lead into the event down to 1.2910, likely on profit-taking – GBP/JPY is down to test the 200-hour moving average, (Yen is a <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/usdjpy">safe haven</a> and GBP/JPY can be a big mover).</p>
