      <h1>BBC to show no live golf in 2020 after losing Masters coverage</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:31:14+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theguardian.com/profile/guardian-sport" target="_blank">Guardian sport</a></address>

        <i>• BBC has had only two days’ coverage since 2011<br/>• No majors in 2020 to be shown live on terrestrial television</i>
      </p>
      <p>The BBC will not show any live golf next year for the first time since 1955 after the broadcaster lost the rights to live coverage of the Masters. Sky Sports will be the sole broadcasters of the tournament from Augusta.</p>
      <p>The BBC lost the rights to the Open in 2016, ending a 60-year run with Britain’s flagship tournament, while their live Masters coverage was pared back to two days in 2011. From next year terrestrial viewers will be able to watch only highlights.</p>
      <p>Sky Sports managing director, Rob Webster, said: “We are proud of our 10-year association with Augusta National, and our golf team does a great job sharing the magic of the Masters with our viewers.”</p>
      <p>Tiger Woods <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/apr/14/masters-tiger-woods-molinari-finau-schauffele-koepka">won the Masters</a> this year, his first major in 11 years, and next year’s tournament will be played from 9-12 April.</p>
