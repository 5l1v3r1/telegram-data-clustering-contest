      <p>Fans of Netflix's <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/stranger-things/"><i>Stranger Things</i></a> might be surprised to learn that some people didn't think it would be a huge hit, including star David Harbour. In fact, he told Stephen Colbert that he thought it was going to be a giant failure.</p>
      <p>Appearing on <a href="https://www.cbs.com/shows/the-late-show-with-stephen-colbert/"><i>The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,</i></a> Harbor confessed to Colbert that he was sure the show would fail, and that the people at Netflix were of the same mind. Harbor remembers Netflix executives telling him they were going to "bury" the show,  thinking audiences wouldn't respond and that nobody would watch it. As we now know, it became one of the most popular shows of the year.</p>
