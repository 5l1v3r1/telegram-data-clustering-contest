      <p>MADRID -- Vasek Pospisil has recorded his second major upset in as many days, giving Canada a 1-0 lead in its best-of-three tie against the United States at the inaugural Davis Cup Finals.</p>
      <p>Pospisil, ranked 150th in the world, beat world No. 36 Reilly Opelka 7-6 (5), 7-6 (7) on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old Pospisil, from Vancouver, beat world No. 12 Fabio Fognini on Monday en route to Canada's 2-1 win over Italy. Pospisil was a late replacement for Felix Auger-Aliassime (ankle injury) against Italy.</p>
      <p>Winning the tie over the Americans would guarantee Canada a spot in the quarterfinals.</p>
      <p>The six-foot-11 Opelka, known for his big serve, fought off one match point in the second set to tie it at 6-6. But Pospisil rebounded to finish it off.</p>
      <p>Pospisil, who reached a career-high No. 25 in the rankings in 2014, tumbled down the list after missing the first half of 2019 following back surgery.</p>
      <p>But he has shown signs of progress in recent months, upsetting then-No. 9 Karen Khachanov at the U.S. Open before advancing to the round of 16 at the Shanghai Masters.</p>
      <p>Playing a level down in Challengers earlier this fall, Pospisil captured two tournament titles in the U.S.</p>
      <p>Pospisil is now 19-18 in Davis Cup play.</p>
      <p>Canada's Denis Shapovalov, who clinched the tie over Italy with an upset of Matteo Berrettini, meets American Taylor Fritz in the second singles match.</p>
      <p>Shapovalov, from Richmond Hill, Ont., and Pospisil then are scheduled to face Sam Querrey and Jack Sock in doubles. Shapovalov and Pospisil lost a three-set doubles match to Italy yesterday.</p>
      <p>The winners of each of the six groups and the next two best teams advance to the quarterfinals.</p>
