      <p>Two days after the attack on Congress MLA Tanveer Sait in Mysuru, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa slammed Leader of the Opposition Siddaramaiah over the matter and asked him to clarify why he allegedly shielded Popular Front of India (PFI) activists by withdrawing cases against them when he was CM. There are allegations that a PFI activist was behind the attack on Mr. Sait in Mysuru.</p>
      <p>Speaking to reporters, Mr. Yediyurappa said PFI activists were responsible for incidents of violence in Mysuru and Shivamogga that had claimed a life. “I want to ask Siddaramaiah today, why did you protect PFI goondas? Why did you withdraw cases against them? Now, the attack has taken place on Tanveer Sait. You are indirectly supporting them (PFI activists)” he said.</p>
      <p>Reacting to Mr. Yediyurappa’s allegations, Mr. Siddaramiah tweeted, “We are not protecting any communal organization. Let the CM take action against any organizations taking part in communal activities. It’s not correct on the part of BSY to politicise the matter.”</p>
