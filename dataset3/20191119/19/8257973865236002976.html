      <p>Nov. 19 (UPI) -- Most Democratic voters are willing to support a less-than-ideal candidate from the party in next year's election -- as long as they defeat President <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Donald_Trump/?tps=1">Donald Trump</a>, a new survey said Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Gallup said its poll found 60 percent of Democratic and Democratic-leaning respondents said they would favor a candidate with whom they disagree on some key issues if they were more likely to beat Trump. Thirty-six percent said they would stick with the candidate who shares their views on key issues, but may be less likely to win.</p>
      <p>The poll also showed half of Democrats and Democratic leans prefer a politically moderate nominee.</p>
      <p>The survey showed 51 percent of Democrats believe former Vice President <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Joe_Biden/?tps=1">Joe Biden</a> has the best chance of beating Trump. Sixteen percent named Vermont Sen. <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Bernie_Sanders/?tps=1">Bernie Sanders</a> and 15 percent identified Massachusetts Sen. <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Elizabeth_Warren/?tps=1">Elizabeth Warren</a>. They were the only three candidates included in Gallup's poll.</p>
      <p>Three percent named South Bend, Ind., Mayor <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Pete-Buttigieg/?tps=1">Pete Buttigieg</a> and 2 percent entrepreneur <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Andrew-Yang/?tps=1">Andrew Yang</a>. Sen. <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Amy_Klobuchar/?tps=1">Amy Klobuchar</a>, D-Minn., and former New York City Mayor <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Michael_Bloomberg/?tps=1">Michael Bloomberg</a> attracted 1 percent.</p>
      <p>Gallup questioned more than 1,000 U.S. adults for the survey, which has a margin of error of 6 points.</p>
      <p>A Gallup poll last spring showed 58 percent of Democratic voters also preferred the most electable candidate.</p>
