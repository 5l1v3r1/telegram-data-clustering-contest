      <p>Liverpool winger Xherdan Shaqiri has handed <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jurgen-klopp/">Jurgen Klopp</a> a welcome boost by returning to training ahead of the side’s trip to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/crystal-palace-fc/">Crystal Palace</a>.</p>
      <p>Shaqiri, 28, has been out of action for around two months with a calf injury and has only made four appearances for the Reds across all competitions this term since the start of the campaign.</p>
      <p>The Switzerland international <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/06/xherdan-shaqiri-admits-dissatisfied-lack-playing-time-liverpool-10870993/">admitted earlier this season that he’s grown ‘dissatisfied’ with his peripheral role</a> on Merseyside and will no doubt be itching for game-time against Palace this weekend.</p>
      <p>Shaqiri joined up with the rest of his team-mates at Melwood on Tuesday and could be in contention to feature at Selhurst Park.</p>

      <p>Klopp recently joked that Shaqiri’s rehabilitation from his calf problem was taking longer than expected due to his ‘big muscles’.</p>

      <p>‘I saw Shaq this morning and spoke to him,’ the German said ahead of Liverpool’s victory over Tottenham at Anfield.</p>
      <p>‘It will take a little bit of time still.</p>
      <p>‘Big muscles, unfortunately, it needs a little bit longer to heal.’</p>
      <p>Both Mohamed Salah and Andy Robertson remain doubts for Saturday’s clash after sustaining ankle injuries, while Joe Gomez (knee) should be available to play.</p>

      <p>Jamie Carragher has urged Klopp to concentrate on the Premier League ahead of a congested run of fixtures for his former club.</p>
      <p>‘I know a lot of Liverpool supporters wouldn’t say this, and certainly the club couldn’t, but nothing can get in the way of Liverpool winning the league. Nothing,’ he told the <i>Liverpool Echo.</i></p>
      <p>The Aston Villa game in the Carabao Cup? If Liverpool get through they will have two semi-finals to play then and that cannot get in the way of Liverpool winning the league.</p>
      <p>‘What I mean by that is do not play anyone in your first XI in that Carabao Cup team. Not one.</p>
      <p>‘If Liverpool win the league this year and find themselves in the same position next year I wouldn’t be saying that.</p>
      <p>‘I’d probably be saying “we are Liverpool Football Club. We should try and win the lot.”</p>

      <p>‘But because it has been so long nothing can be allowed to get in the way of Liverpool pushing on and winning the league.’</p>
