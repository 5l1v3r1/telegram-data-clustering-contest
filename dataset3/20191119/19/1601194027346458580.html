      <p>The second day of action carries on at the ISSF World Cup Final in Putian, China as three Indian shooters will test the field with the hopes of making past the qualification round to the final rounds. The trio of Anish Bhanwala, <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/manu-bhaker">Manu Bhaker</a> and <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/rahi-sarnobat">Rahi Sarnobat</a> will be up for the challenge as they aim for the first medal finish for India at the ISSF World Cup Final.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, three shooters - Sanjeev Rajput, Anjum Moudgil and Akhil Sheoran bowed out of the competition as they failed to make the final eight spots in the qualification round in the 50 metre 3 positions event.</p>
      <p>First up will be the two women Manu Bhaker and Rahi Sarnobat in the Women's 25 metre pistol event. Both Bhaker and Sarnobat have been amongst the medals for the nation on the international shooting circuit. They had secured their position in the <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/tokyo-olympics-2020">2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics</a> back at the ISSF World Cup Finals held in Munich, Germany.</p>
      <p>Sarnobat is a veteran shooter who has won multiple medals in the Commonwealth Games, Asian Games and the ISSF World Cup as well. She won the gold medal in the 25 metre pistol event earlier this year at the ISSF World Cup finals event in Munich. Sarnobat was the first Indian woman to ever qualify for the 25 metre pistol event in the 2012 Olympics when she won the bronze medal at the 2011 ISSF World Cup held in the United States of America.</p>

      <p>Manu Bhaker is one of the most promising young Indian shooters on the circuit and has risen quickly in stature. Bhaker became the youngest Indian to win a gold medal at the ISSF World Cup when she won at the age of 16 in the 10 metre air pistol event in Guadalajara, Mexico. She added another gold medal at the same event with a 10 metre air pistol mixed team.</p>
      <p>Bhaker continued her strong form in 2018 winning the gold medal in 10 metre air pistol at the 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games and the 2018 Buenos Aires Youth Olympic Games. She upped her game in 2019 and added four gold medals in the 10 metre air pistol mixed team event, securing her spot in Tokyo Olympics and will be a strong contender here in Putian, China as well.</p>
      <p>The final shooter in action for India will be the youngster Anish Bhanwala, who hails from the town of Karnal, Haryana. Anish is a multiple-time gold medalist at the ISSF Junior World Cup in the 25 metre rapid fire and and 25 metre standard pistol event. Anish added a major honor to his list when he won the 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games medal in the 25 metre raid fire pistol event.</p>
      <p>All three of these shooters will be strong contenders and can help India break their duck at the ISSF World Cup Finals in Putian, China.</p>
