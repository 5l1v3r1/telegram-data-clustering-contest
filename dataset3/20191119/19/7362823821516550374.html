      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/entertainment/celebrity-news">Mel Gibson</a> is enduring the Southern California heat in his own way.</p>
      <p>On Monday, the 63-year-old actor made a quick run to his neighborhood's Whole Foods supermarket in Malibu in the most relaxed way possible — donning a simple black cap pulled low over his face, leaving his signature white beard exposed, a black collared shirt and blue shorts.</p>
      <p>Missing from Gibson’s ensemble were his shoes, as he meandered through the parking lot of the grocery store blackening the soles of his feet  while cradling a brown paper bag of his selections.</p>

      <p>The "Braveheart" star also appeared heftier than what fans would normally recognize him to be, though the extra girth is likely the result of Gibson packing on pounds for his <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/mel-gibson-santa-claus-fatman">role of Santa Clause</a> in the upcoming film “Fatman.”</p>

      <p>Gibson is attached as Kris Kringle in the film to be directed by Ian and Eshom Nelms and is executive produced by David Gordon Green and Danny McBride.</p>

      <p>The filmmakers call it a "rowdy Santa tale" about an unorthodox Santa Claus who is targeted by a hitman hired by a 12-year-old after he receives coal in his stocking.</p>
