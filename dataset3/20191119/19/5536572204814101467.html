      <p>This announcer likely had no clue what ‘dirty sanchez’ actually meant when he said it.</p>
      <p>During the final seconds of the Bills-Dolphins game — CBS play-by-play announcer Spero Dedes and color commentator Adam Archuleta got into a discussion about grooming.</p>
      <p>Archuleta: “One has to ask themselves, a $30 tie or a $30 mustache.”</p>
      <p>Dedes: “Can we get you to grow the stache by next week?”</p>
      <p>That’s when Archuleta said he “could probably squeeze out maybe a Dirty Sanchez, not really a full stache.”</p>

      <p>The Dirty Sanchez is not a reference to an actual mustache made out of facial hair.</p>
      <p>Just <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=dirty%20sanchez">read here</a> if you’re unfamiliar.</p>
      <p>I’m sure he regrets this now.</p>
