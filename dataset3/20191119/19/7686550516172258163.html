      </figure>
      <p>The first ever televised political debate saw Richard Nixon pitted against John F Kennedy ahead of the 1960 US presidential election.</p>
      <p>Nixon had been the favourite, but struggled with the way he projected himself on screen in stark contrast to JFK's confident and slick style.</p>
      <p>It took 50 years for the UK to televise political clashes of its own in 2010, a three-way debate between Labour prime minister Gordon Brown, Conservative party leader David Cameron, and Liberal Democrats leader Nick Clegg which attracted 9.4 million viewers.</p>
      <p>Since then, and through subsequent debates, intense scrutiny has been placed on how the candidates handled themselves coupled with detailed analysis on their body language.</p>
      <p>In every political debate, it’s common for us to want to choose a decisive ‘winner’.</p>
      <p>Body language is just part of that criteria, but how do you know who dominated who with their nonverbal expression?</p>
      <p>We spoke to a former undercover police officer and body language expert Ronnie Howard who shared these tips on spotting gestures that might indicate if Corbyn or Johnson is lying or just feeling stressed and uncomfortable.</p>

      <h4>Hand to mouth</h4>
      <p>"Humans are taught to lie and research has shown that people tend to try and cover their mouths as they speak a lie.</p>
      <p>"It's an instinctive attempt to contain the words and stop them coming out the person's mouth," says Ronnie, a former detective in West Midlands Police undercover squad.</p>
      <h4>Hand gestures</h4>
      <p>"It’s easy to recognize them as one or both hands emphasize certain words.</p>
      <p>"A common mistake is to make the gestures too close or far from the body, or not in time with the word you want to stress."</p>

        <figcaption>Open-handed gestures tend to indicate honesty and openness</figcaption>

      <h4>Pacifiers</h4>
      <p>"Touching our clothes like touching the tie or stretching in a suit are signs of stress, as well as the subtle crossing or simply touching of a finger over another.</p>
      <p>"If either of the leaders touch their faces it's indicating a lot of stress."</p>
      <h4>Chin angle</h4>
      <p>"A horizontal chin oozes self confidence while a chin raised too much projects pride or even arrogance and disdain.</p>
      <p>"A downward chin is displaying mistrust and is an evolutionary gesture designed to protect the vulnerable neck."</p>
      <h4>Shuffling on the spot and shoulder tension</h4>
      <p>"Experience showed us that a suspect squirming in his chair or while standing indicated he was uncomfortable and wanted to get away.</p>
      <p>"If the shoulders tend to rise and shrug and that position is maintained its likely that its a flight or fight response.</p>
      <p>"And look out for the suits Corbyn and Johnson are wearing.</p>
      <p>"The fabric makes it easier to appreciate this body tension, because it ‘amplifies’ the movement."</p>

      <h4>Jaw position</h4>
      <p>"The area of ​​the mouth and jaw on both men is something to keep an eye on.</p>
      <p>"Pay particular attention to a forward projecting jaw (threat), tight lips (frustration and annoyance) while a tense jaw indicates the person is trying to contain their rage."</p>
      <h4>Thinking in pictures</h4>
      <p>"We think in pictures so if asked a question like what colour is your front door people tend to shift their gaze upwards or sideways in an attempt to picture and retrieve the memory.</p>
      <p>"Liars tend to look downwards when asked a question that they can't answer truthfully."</p>
      <h4>Dress and voice</h4>
      <p>"Although strictly speaking the way people dress isn't body language but style and colours of attire do project a certain image.</p>
      <p>"Meanwhile if you detect an increase in volume it usually indicates emotion and happiness. Volume reduction points to caution and insecurity as does a failure to get words out properly.</p>
      <p>"Pregnant pauses in speech of more than 5 seconds at a time indicate indecision and lack of preparation."</p>
