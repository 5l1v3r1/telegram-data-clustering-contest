We've not had them together a long time, Aaron was missing for almost a year. It's not just about two players though, we need to be together as a team to get the victory."<br/> </p>

The teenager is enduring a frustrating time at RB Leipzig at the moment and you can't help but feel that had he dropped down to a Championship club on loan from Chelsea this season, he would be a permanent fixture in Giggs' starting line-up. Instead, at club level, he's played just 66 minutes since August.</p>

        <blockquote>"I find it hilarious to be honest, especially some of the pictures and stuff my friends send me," he said of the jokes and headline regularly featuring in the Spanish press. "On one it said triple bogey - and I've never had a triple bogey! At least give me an albatross! It's funny. Some of the things I have seen, people don't understand and don't know what they're on about. So I just find it quite funny.</blockquote>

        <blockquote>The team in 2016, everyone, whether you were involved or a fan or watching on TV, it was amazing. If we can recreate that atmosphere, it’s fantastic. It’s not about individuals. As a player, that’s over now. Now I’m a manager. I think we’ve put ourselves in a great position. We’ve still got one game to go and a tough game, so we’ll need to win that to qualify.</blockquote>

His side are desperate to avenge their defeat against Ireland at the same stage of qualifying which saw them miss out on the 2018 World Cup.</p>
        <blockquote>I think we can use both of them to our advantage. We have got the kind of euphoria of qualifying for our first Euros and doing so well at the competition that we really want to do that again. We’ve also got the negatives of knowing how it feels to miss out on qualifying for a tournament like we did the World Cup so we can use both of them to our advantage.</blockquote>
