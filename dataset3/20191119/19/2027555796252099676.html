      <h1>New Sri Lankan Prez to visit India on November 29</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:43:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:43</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/anirban-bhaumik" target="_blank">Anirban Bhaumik</a></address>
      <p>Sri Lanka's President Gobaya Rajapaksa will visit India on November 29, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar confirmed after meeting the newly-elected leader of the island nation in Colombo on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Rajapaksa was sworn in as the new President of Sri Lanka on Monday. Jaishankar was the first representative of a foreign government to meet him after he took the top office in the Indian Ocean island.</p>
      <p>Jaishankar conveyed to Rajapaksa an invitation from Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a visit to New Delhi on November 29. The new President of Sri Lanka accepted the invitation.</p>
      <p>“A warm meeting with Sri Lanka President @GotabayaR. Conveyed PM @narendramodi’s message of a partnership for shared peace, progress, prosperity &amp; security. Confident that under his leadership, #IndiaSriLanka relations would reach greater heights,” External Affairs Minister tweeted, along with pictures of the meeting.</p>
      <p>“President @GotabayaR has accepted PM @narendramodi’s invitation to visit India on 29th November,” he continued in another post on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Rajapaksa, younger brother of former Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa, won the presidential election in Sri Lanka on Sunday – marking the return of the Rajapaksa Clan to power after a gap of almost four years.</p>
      <p>Jaishankar flew to Colombo on Tuesday as Modi Government was keen to reach out to the new leader of the southern neighbour of India.</p>
