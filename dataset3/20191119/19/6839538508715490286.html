      <p>‘Game of Thrones’ star Emilia Clarke has revealed that the show’s bosses coerced her into doing nude scenes, telling her not to disappoint fans.</p>
      <p>Between the explicit romps with Khal Drogo and walking out of burning buildings in her birthday suit, it’s safe to say Daenerys spent more time in the nude than anyone else on the show.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10376531/game-of-thrones-emilia-clarke-nude-scenes/">The Sun</a>, Clarke has spoken out about the pressure she faced when it came to getting naked early on in her career, stressing the importance of boundaries.</p>

      <p>Clarke’s first naked scene saw her sashay into a luxe bath tub.</p>
      <p>She admitted it took time for her to find the confidence to challenge directors when it came to gratuitous exposure and recounted some tense encounters where she was being guilt-tripped.</p>
      <p>“I’m a lot more savvy [now] with what I’m comfortable with, and what I am okay with doing,” she explained.</p>
      <p>“I’ve had fights on set before where I’m like, ‘No, the sheet stays up’, and they’re like, ‘You don’t wanna disappoint your Game of Thrones fans’. And I’m like, ‘F*** you.’”</p>
      <p>Recalling her surprise after being cast in Game of Thrones aged 23, Clarke confessed she was so humble to be on board that she wouldn’t have dared push back against show bosses in season one.</p>

      <p>“I took the job and then they sent me the scripts and I was reading them, and I was, like, ‘Oh, there’s the catch!’” she continued to Dax Shepherd on his podcast Armchair Expert.</p>
      <p>“But I’d come fresh from drama school, and I approached [it] as a job – if it’s in the script then it’s clearly needed, this is what this is and I’m gonna make sense of it … Everything’s gonna be cool,” she went on.</p>

      <p>“So I came to terms with that beforehand, but then going in and doing it … I’m floating through this first season and I have no idea what I’m doing, I have no idea what any of this is.</p>
      <p>“I’ve never been on a film set like this before, I’d been on a film set twice before then, and I’m now on a film set completely naked with all of these people, and I don’t know what I’m meant to do and I don’t know what’s expected of me, and I don’t know what you want and I don’t know what I want.”</p>

      <p>Rather than ruffle feathers, Clarke dealt with her reservations in private, worried they would reflect poorly on her professionalism.</p>
      <p>“Regardless of there being nudity or not, I would have spent that first season thinking I’m not worthy of requiring anything, I’m not worthy of needing anything at all … Whatever I’m feeling is wrong, I’m gonna cry in the bathroom and then I’m gonna come back and we’re gonna do the scene and it’s gonna be completely fine,” she concluded.</p>
      <p>Clarke also credited Khal Drogo actor Jason Momoa for being her rock and supporting her in moments he felt uncomfortable.</p>

      <p>Drogo was brought back from the dead by a witch, only to be left in a vegetative state.</p>
      <p>Still, not one to scrimp on vengeance, Danerys avenged her love by burning said witch alive in front of the Dothraki.</p>
      <p>Clarke is currently starring in festive rom-com Last Christmas.</p>
