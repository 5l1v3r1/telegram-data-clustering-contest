      <h1>A ‘ramp’ a day on runway for 4 months</h1>
      <h2>Structure, built after resurfacing work daily, to be demolished next day</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:25:54+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/M-P-Praveen-536/" target="_blank">M.P. Praveen</a></address>
      <p>The construction and demolition of a ramp structure on the runway at Cochin International Airport every day for the next four-odd months to facilitate smooth and safe aircraft landing and takeoff remains a major challenge during resurfacing work on the runway that gets under way on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The Mumbai-based agency entrusted with the resurfacing work is planning to resurface roughly around 150 metres a day, starting from the eastern end of the runway, with the cooperation of the electrical and civil engineering departments of the airport.</p>
      <p>Aircraft movements remain banned only for an eight-hour window between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. till March 28 next year, which means that the runway has to be left in an operational condition for the remaining hours, notwithstanding the resurfacing works.</p>
      <p>“The difference in the level between the resurfaced part and the rest of the runway needs to be bridged for facilitating smooth landing and takeoffs. For this, a ramp structure will be constructed towards the end of the work every day and will be demolished at the start of the next day’s work and the cycle will continue through the entire duration of the resurfacing work,” said CIAL sources.</p>
      <h3>Lighting system</h3>
      <p>The lighting system at the airport is also set to get a massive upgrade from the existing Category 1 to Category 3.</p>
      <p>A significant improvement will be the doubling of lights along the central line of the runway by increasing the frequency of lights installed from the existing 30 metres to every 15 metres, thus, effecting a rise in the number of lights from the existing 120-odd to nearly 300.</p>
      <p>“Besides, lighted navigational aides will replace mere floral markings at the parking bays fitted with aerobridges. Lighting pattern at the two touchdown zones will also get a scale-up, in addition to lighting along shoulders and curves,” said sources.</p>
      <h3>Work on taxiway</h3>
      <p>The resurfacing starts with the laying of graded bitumen before topping it with three layers of asphalt at 70-mm thickness along the entire runway, having a length of 3,400 metres, a width of 45 metres and additional width of 7.50 metres on both shoulders. Similarly, the taxiway and six taxiway links will also be resurfaced, taking the total area of resurfacing to nearly 5 lakh square metres.</p>
      <h3>Level of friction</h3>
      <p>The resurfacing is aimed at restoring the desired level of friction along the runway, which gets a bit too glazed especially owing to deposit of rubber from the tyres of aircraft.</p>
      <p>The more the number of services, more the deposit of rubber, making resurfacing essential.</p>
      <p>“The work should be complete within three months unless we don’t come across inclement weather and other hiccups. We have kept a buffer of over a month for such unforeseen exigencies,” said sources.</p>
