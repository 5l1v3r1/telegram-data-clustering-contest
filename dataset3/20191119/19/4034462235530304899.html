      <h1>Buick Encore GX Fills The Gap Between Encore And Envision</h1>
      <h2>And it looks pretty handsome.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:40:53+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:40</time> by <a rel="author">Jared Rosenholtz</a></address>
      <p>Buick already revealed its latest crossover, the<a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/buick/encore-gx"> Encore GX</a>, to the Chinese market before announcing it would also be <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/time-to-welcome-a-bigger-and-better-buick-encore-gx">coming to the United States</a>. Now Buick has released all of the details on the Encore GX ahead of its US debut at the 2019 Los Angeles Auto Show. Despite having '<a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/buick/encore">Encore</a>' in its name, the GX is actually a completely new crossover for Buick that doesn't share much (if anything) in common with the smaller Encore. It's actually based on a new platform, which is shared with the upcoming <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/chevrolet/trailblazer">2021 Chevrolet Trailblazer</a>.</p>
      <p>"Premium SUV buyers are looking for features that fit their lifestyle priorities, and Buick is giving customers more segment choices with our new Encore GX," said Duncan Aldred, vice president, Global Buick and GMC. "As we look to the future of Buick, and customer demand trends, our four-SUV portfolio puts us in a strong competitive position across the most popular SUV segments.</p>

      <p>Under the hood of the Encore GX sits either a <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/buick-encore-gx-s-new-turbo-engines-finally-revealed">1.2-liter turbo or 1.3-liter turbocharged engine</a>, both of which have only three cylinders. The former produces 137 horsepower and 166 lb-ft of torque while the latter produces 155 hp and 174 lb-ft of torque. Both engines will be mated to a continuously variable transmission in FWD guise while the 1.3-liter AWD model gets a nine-speed automatic. GM estimates the larger engine will achieve up to 31 mpg combined.</p>
      <p>All Encore GX models include Forward Collision Alert, Automatic Emergency Braking, Front Pedestrian Braking, Lane Keep Assist with Lane Departure Warning, a Following Distance Indicator, and IntelliBeam headlamps with automatically-adjusting high/low beams. Optional equipment includes Rear Park Assist, Rear Cross-Traffic Alert, Lane Change Alert, Rear Camera Mirror, Hands-Free Power Liftgate, Adaptive Cruise Control, Head-Up Display, Automatic Parking Assist, and a High Definition Surround Vision camera system.</p>

      <p>"Filling the spot between the smaller Encore and the larger Envision and Enclave models, the Encore GX is another proof point that Buick is The Premium SUV Brand. Just as we did with the Enclave in 2008 and the Encore in 2013, we identified a growing market niche and moved quickly to introduce a new vehicle to fill it," Aldred added.</p>
      <p>The Encore GX is slightly larger than the Encore with 94.3 cubic feet of passenger space and 25.3 cubic feet of cargo space behind the second row. Buick says the GX also includes a standard, adjustable two-stage load floor, and a 40/60 split-folding second row. The Encore GX is set to arrive in North America in early 2020. Base models include 18-inch aluminum wheels but buyers can also opt for the Sport Touring package with exclusive wheels, body-color surrounds, and a black mesh grille with red accents. Full pricing information should be revealed prior to launch.</p>
