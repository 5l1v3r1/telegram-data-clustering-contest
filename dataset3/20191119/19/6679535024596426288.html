      <h1>Activists targeted by Pegasus write to parliamentary panel</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:49:27+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Sonam-Saigal-911/" target="_blank">Sonam Saigal</a></address>
      <p>A group of journalists, lawyers and activists, calling themselves Pegasus-targeted persons, on Tuesday wrote to the Parliamentary Standing Committee that they are willing to depose before it, and urged it to summon the relevant government records and officials to identify who carried out and authorised the illegal surveillance.</p>
      <p>The letter has been signed by Ajmal Khan, Alok Shukla, Anand Teltumbde, Ankit Grewal, Asish Gupta, Mandeep Singh, Nihalsing B. Rathod, Rupali Jadhav, Shalini Gera, Balla Ravindranath, Bela Bhatia, Degree Prasad Chouhan, Jagdish Meshram, Sushil, Vidhya, Vira Sathidar and Vivek Sundara. On November 1, they were informed by WhatsApp that their electronic devices had been targeted by advanced spyware called Pegasus.</p>
      <p>They have also urged the Standing Committee to find out what the role of the State and Central governments was in this operation, and which individuals have been affected.</p>
      <h3>‘Violation of rights’</h3>
      <p>They said the snooping was “a violation of our fundamental right to privacy and compromises our safety and security, as well as the privacy, safety and security of our families, friends, colleagues, clients and any and every citizen who has communicated with us through our mobile devices.”</p>
      <p>The letter said a statement made by Minister for Information Technology Ravi Shankar Prasad on October 31 added to their concerns. Mr. Prasad said the targeting of human rights defenders and civil society activists had been carried out without the knowledge and permission of the Government of India.</p>
      <h3>Security concern</h3>
      <p>The ‘Pegasus-targeted persons’ said, “If this is true, the Pegasus attacks have serious implications for national security. The fact that foreign private companies and other foreign actors have penetrated the national telecommunications infrastructure without detection by Indian security agencies, and now possess the ability to access and extract the most intimate details of so many Indian citizens, is a violation of international norms and is a direct attack on our national sovereignty.”</p>
      <p>They sought to know which agencies and entities are carrying out this surveillance of Indian citizens, if sections of the government were involved in deployment of the Pegasus software, if public money was spent on these attacks and who authorised this expenditure.</p>
      <p>They also asked whether central security agencies are aware of the presence of the NSO Group employees and operatives in India, if these operatives entered the country legally, and what steps the government is taking to identify and bring to book the entities involved in the Pegasus attacks and other possible instances of illegal and unauthorised surveillance of Indian citizens.</p>
      <p>They also asked what steps the government is taking to identify and repair the breaches in the national telecommunications infrastructure and protect it against any further attacks.</p>
      <p>“In the interests of transparent, accountable and responsive governance, we urge you to also make public the details of the companies, agencies and other entities authorised by the Government of India to carry out surveillance in accordance with legal provisions. What are the terms and conditions that govern the operations of these agencies? What are the arrangements for monitoring and overseeing their work?” they asked.</p>
