      <p><b>Tom Cruise</b> is not constantly trying to recruit his friends and co-stars for Scientology, despite a recurring narrative that frequently pops up in the tabloids. In the last 14 months, <b>Gossip Cop</b> has busted multiple takes on the topic, with A-listers like <b>Barbra Streisand</b>, <b>Joaquin Phoenix</b> and <b>Demi Moore</b> all named as alleged recruits. We can confirm that this oft-repeated storyline is totally false.</p>
      <p>In September 2018, the <i>Globe</i> alleged <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/tom-cruise-barbra-streisand-scientology/">Cruise was trying to recruit his “idol,” Barbra Streisand, into the religion</a>. According to the outlet, the movie star is “obsessed” with the legendary singer and has been “crushing on her” for years. The publication quoted a supposed insider as saying Cruise believed “she would be the best thing for Scientology ever.” <b>Gossip Cop</b> immediately debunked the silly story by checking with a source close to Streisand, who told us the article was totally false. Cruise never reached out to the singer.</p>
      <p>In January, the <i>Globe</i> upped the ante by asserting <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/tom-cruise-top-gun-maverick-scientology/">Cruise was trying to recruit two of his <i>Top Gun: Maverick</i> co-stars</a> at the same time. The tabloid alleged Miles Teller and Glenn Powell were both targeted by Cruise for membership, and according to a dubious source, Cruise was “barraging” them with Scientology teachings. This phony report was an attempt to sell papers by connecting the cast of a highly-anticipated movie to Cruise’s devotion to Scientology. There was no truth to the story, as <b>Gossip Cop</b> reported at the time, which was confirmed by a source involved in the film’s production.</p>
      <p>In May, the <i>Globe</i> was back at it, recycling the same trope but adding a twist, this time it wasn’t a co-star, <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/tom-cruise-daughter-suri-scientology-recruit-katie-holmes/">it was his estranged daughter Suri that Cruise was trying to recruit. </a>Despite the two not having spoken in years, the tabloid contended the <i>Mission: Impossible</i> star was back in contact with the teen and “meddling with her mind” to get her involved in the church. A questionable tipster claimed Cruise believed Suri “is a true princess and belongs with them.” The ridiculous notion was debunked by <b>Gossip Cop</b> after we spoke with a rep for Suri’s mother, Katie Holmes, who told on the record it wasn’t factual.</p>
      <p>Last month, <i>NW</i> invented a creative, but equally untrue version of the story. The outlet maintained that <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/tom-cruise-demi-moore-scientology-bride/">Cruise was begging Demi Moore to be his “Scientology bride.”</a> The tabloid was taking advantage of the publicity surrounding the release of Moore’s autobiography. The phony allegations were made up to connect her to Cruise, who she co-starred with in <i>A Few Good Men</i> almost 30 years ago. <b>Gossip Cop</b> found no evidence of a recent connection between the two former co-stars.</p>
      <p>Just last week, <i>Star</i> claimed the most recent target of <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/tom-cruise-joaquin-phoenix-scientology-mission-impossible/">Cruise’s alleged recruiting was Joaquin Phoenix</a>. This claim is dubious from the start, considering Phoenix starred in <i>The Master,</i> which was loosely based on Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard and it didn’t exactly portray Hubbard or the church in a positive light. The idea that Cruise would target Phoenix to join the church was completely outlandish, especially given Phoenix’s experience early in life with the Children of God cult, which his parents escaped when the actor was a child. <b>Gossip Cop</b> checked in with a rep for Phoenix, who told us on the record the story was “fabricated,” just like all of the stories pushing this bogus premise.</p>
