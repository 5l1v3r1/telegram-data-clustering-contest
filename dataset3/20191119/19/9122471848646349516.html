      <h1>Justin Fields Opens Up About De-Committing From Penn State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:29:01+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:29</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>In just a few days, the biggest game of the season for the Big Ten will kick off from Columbus.</p>
      <p>No. 1 Ohio State hosts No. 9 Penn State in a game with major College Football Playoff implications. Although the Nittany Lions have one loss, they still control their own destiny. If Penn State wins out, it will likely get a spot in the playoff, but the Buckeyes won’t go down easy.</p>
      <p>In fact, Ohio State is favored by nearly 20 points.</p>
      <p>Star quarterback Justin Fields is a major part of that. The Georgia transfer has the Buckeyes’ offense firing on all cylinders and scoring with the best offenses in the nation.</p>
      <p>Penn State fans have to be wondering what could have been. Fields was committed to play for James Franklin before de-committing from the program and heading to Georgia.</p>
      <p>Before this weekend’s big game, Fields spoke about his decision to walk away from Penn State.</p>
      <p>“It was definitely one of the hardest phone calls I’ve had to make,” he said. Fields also likened the decision to breaking up with a girlfriend.</p>

      <p>The decision to attend Georgia eventually led him to Ohio State, where the Buckeyes are a heavy favorite to win the conference and make the playoff.</p>
      <p>It seems like he made the right call in the end.</p>
