      <h1>Jeffrey Epstein used ‘strip of bedsheet’ in first suicide attempt: feds</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:24:59+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:24</time> by <a rel="author">Emily Saul and Bruce Golding</a></address>
      <p>Jeffrey Epstein was found with a “strip of bedsheet around his neck” during his failed, July suicide attempt — and should have had a cellmate <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/08/10/convicted-pedophile-jeffrey-epstein-dead/">when he hanged himself the next month</a> with what sources have said was a bedsheet, it was revealed Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The details <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/19/2-jail-guards-indicted-in-connection-to-jeffrey-epsteins-death/">emerged in the indictment of two Manhattan prison guards</a> charged with failing to check on the notorious pedophile and falsifying reports to cover their tracks.</p>
      <p>But law-enforcement sources familiar with Epstein’s case said higher-ups at the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center should also be held accountable for his death.</p>
      <p>“These are just the little guys,” one source said of guards Tova Noel and Michael Thomas.</p>
      <p>“The bigger question is: Why was he in that cell alone? Because that was against protocol. And if these guys were arrested . . . someone else can be arrested for leaving him alone.”</p>
      <p>Another source noted that the guards “weren’t responsible for him being alone in the cell and they weren’t responsible for giving him the sheet.”</p>
      <p>Following his apparent attempted suicide on July 23, Epstein was kept under 24-hour watch in the prison hospital wing until July 30.</p>
      <p>He was returned to the MCC’s “Special Housing Unit” “at the direction of the MCC’s psychological staff” and “required to have an assigned cellmate,” court papers say.</p>
      <p>But that inmate left MCC “in a routine, pre-arranged transfer” at 8 a.m. Aug. 9, the indictment says.</p>
      <p>Noel and another guard put Epstein back in his cell at 7:49 p.m. that day following an attorney visit and he was found hanging at 6:30 a.m. the following morning, according to the indictment.</p>
      <p>Sources said the situation called for further probing by feds.</p>
      <p>“You can see why everyone doesn’t think this was a suicide,” one source said.</p>
      <p>“The investigation has to continue.”</p>
