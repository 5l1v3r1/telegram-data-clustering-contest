      <h1>Urban Meyer Reveals His Latest College Football Playoff Picks</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:46:03+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/danlyons" target="_blank">Dan Lyons</a></address>
      <p>At this point, there is little doubt about the top three teams in the <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/the-college-football-playoff-rankings-after-week-11-have-been-released">College Football Playoff rankings</a>. Urban Meyer and his FOX Sports colleagues are pretty split on the fourth team at the moment.</p>
      <p>Ohio State and LSU are almost universally seen as the top two teams. Urban Meyer, along with former USC quarterback Matt Leinart and FOX Sports analyst Joel Klatt are rolling with the Buckeyes to win it all, while Reggie Bush, Brady Quinn, and Rob Stone like the Tigers.</p>
      <p>Five of the six analysts have Clemson in the third spot. Klatt has Clemson and LSU flipped. The best argument there is Clemson’s recent dominance, albeit against a weak schedule, vs. LSU looking pretty shaky on defense against middling opponents like Ole Miss and Vanderbilt.</p>
      <p>The fourth spot brings the most intrigue as of now. With Minnesota’s loss at Iowa, and Alabama losing Tua Tagovailoa to a season-ending injury against Mississippi State, as of now the top candidates look like Georgia, or a one-loss Pac-12 champion.</p>
      <p>Leinart, Bush, Quinn, and Stone all like the Dawgs, who scored a big win at Auburn on Saturday. Meyer and Klatt are rolling with Oregon, which has looked very strong since its narrow Week 1 loss to Auburn.</p>

      <p>If this holds, Alabama’s impressive streak of Playoff berths will snap. The Crimson Tide have never been left out of the four team field, since the sport shifted to the format from the BCS in 2014. With the loss to LSU likely shutting Alabama out of the SEC title game, and Tua’s absence, it is hard to see a path for Nick Saban’s team.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, LSU making the field would keep in tact the streak of a new team making the top four every year. Clemson, Georgia, Ohio State, and Oregon have all made the CFP at least once.</p>
      <p>The new College Football Playoff rankings will be unveiled on ESPN at 7 p.m. ET tonight.</p>
