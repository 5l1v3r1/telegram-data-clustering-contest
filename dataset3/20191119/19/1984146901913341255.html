      <h1>Rafa Benitez's decade-defining impact at Newcastle United</h1>
      <h2>Benitez has left a lasting impression on Newcastle United, but what were the fundamentals of his tactics and philosophies over his three years in charge that had such an impact at St James' park</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:00</time> by <a rel="author">David Alexander Hughes</a></address>
      <p>It’s been a turbulent decade for Newcastle United with some highs but perhaps too many lows.</p>
      <p>One of the more gloomy periods in the clubs recent history came in 2016 when Newcastle sacked manager <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/steve-mcclaren">Steve McClaren</a> after United suffered a miserable season and languished one-point above the relegation zone with 10 games to go.</p>
      <p>Newcastle had been mainstays in the Premier League since their promotion at the start of the decade. However, baring a chance campaign that saw them finish fifth under Alan Pardew in 2012, United had often loitered inside the bottom 10 and regularly flirted with relegation during this period.</p>
      <p>Pardew departed St James' Park four years into his eight-year contract in 2014 to join Crystal Palace and was replaced by interim boss John Carver. The Magpies narrowly avoided relegation before McClaren arrived in the summer of 2015 following the recommendation of influential chief scout Graham Carr.</p>
      <p>Although McClaren oversaw some shrewd acquisitions including the likes of Georginio Wijnaldum, Aleksandar Mitrovic, Jonjo Shelvey, Andros Townsend and Chancel Mbemba, he struggled to get any real form from his side which ultimately led to his dismissal.</p>

      <p>With Newcastle struggling and staring relegation in the face, they somehow managed to land <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/rafa-benitez">Rafa Benitez</a> as his replacement, with the Spanish coach signing a three-year contract upon his shock arrival at St James' Park.</p>
      <p>The tactician had previously built a fine reputation in England after he spent six years as Liverpool boss, winning the Champions League in 2005.</p>
      <p>His most recent role in England saw him take the reins on an interim basis at Chelsea in 2012 after the club parted company with Roberto Di Matteo. He initially proved an unpopular appointment due to his Liverpool connections. However, he rewarded Roman Abramovich’s faith with the Europa League crown at the end of the season.</p>
      <p>He thereafter went to Napoli and lifted the Coppa Italia before joining Real Madrid, however, he lasted just seven months with the Spanish Giants before his dismissal.</p>
      <p>Despite this, there was a genuine sense of excitement at St James’ Park after recruiting one of Europe’s perceived top managers.</p>
      <h4>The pursuit of survival</h4>
      <p>Upon his arrival, Benitez’s aim was to install a structured and organised tactical approach. At the time, Newcastle actually boasted a decent starting 11 on paper, with the likes of Moussa Sissoko, Wijnaldum, Ayoze Perez, Mitrovic and Papiss Cisse all providing them with better playing squad than most of their relegation rivals.</p>
      <p>There was however a criticism of the side under McClaren that these players were often shoehorned into the side, with the former England boss reluctant to leave any key players out which would sometimes created an unbalance across the team in key areas of the pitch. Benitez was aware of this and quickly made it clear he would be willing to drop big personalities when required, with mainstays such as Sissoko and Jonjo Shevley facing a spell on the sidelines at various stages.</p>

      <p>Tactically, Benitez set his side up in the same way for most matches. Out of possession, Newcastle would often sit in a flat 4-4-1-1, allowing the opposition the opportunity to carry the ball forward before pressing aggressively in their own half and restricting the space for them to play. Meanwhile, with the ball, Newcastle would line up in something similar to a 4-2-3-1.</p>
      <p>Although Benitez didn’t pick up his first win until his fourth game in charge, Newcastle ended the season with a six-match unbeaten run and were unlucky to suffer relegation, mostly due to the form of rivals Sunderland who claimed 12 points from their final six fixtures.</p>
      <h4>Laying the foundations for what was to come</h4>
      <p>Despite their relegation, Benitez opted to stay on as Newcastle manager and committed to the club ahead of their season back in the Championship. In that summer, Benitez oversaw notable departures of the likes of Cisse, Sissoko and Wijnaldum - with the latter two providing healthy profits.</p>
      <p>Benitez replaced them with versatile players who could play a number of roles and implement his structured philosophy, all while bringing more defensive discipline to the side. These players included Matt Ritchie, Grant Hanley, Ciaran Clark, Mohamed Diame and Isaac Hayden.</p>
      <p>Even the attackers he recruited, such as Dwight Gayle and Christian Atsu, all boasted a high workrate and were comfortable in dropping deep without the ball in order to contribute in the defensive aspects of the game.</p>
      <p>In that season in the Championship, the Spaniard continued to rely predominantly on a 4-4-1-1 formation consisting of a flat back four and flat midfield in order to maintain a key principle of his philosophy - defensive solidity.</p>

      <p>When in attack, the two central midfielders would hold their positions whilst Benitez instructed his wing-backs to make overlapping runs and support wingers. There was a big emphasis on crossing the ball into the box and that season, only Fulham attempted more crosses into the box than Newcastle’s total of 850.</p>
      <p>It proved a successful means of attack for United who finished the season as the second-highest goal scorers with a total of 85 goals. Even though he wasn’t much of a threat in the air, Gayle was one of the beneficiaries of this setup due to his ability to find pockets of space in the 18-yard-box and he netted a stunning 23 league goals.</p>
      <p>Newcastle’s compact formation also saw them finish the campaign having conceded just 40 league goals - the joint-lowest in the division. They also had the lowest Expected Goals Against (xGA) in the division, reaffirming their prowess in defence.</p>
      <p>Under Rafa, Newcastle secured the Championship title and returned to the Premier League at the first time of asking.</p>
      <h4>Adaptation required</h4>
      <p>With his side well adjusted to his tactical structure, Benitez made a clear attempt to add more firepower to his side, and did so, despite some frustrations when it came to getting transfers over the line. The club recruited the likes of <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/florian-lejeune">Florian Lejeune</a>, Jacob Murphy, Joselu and made the loan deal for Atsu permanent.</p>
      <p>In this campaign, Benitez adapted his side's tactical approach, veering away from his previously favoured 4-4-1-1 and instead utilising a 4-2-3-1.</p>
      <p>Solidity in defence remained a key foundation for Benitez’s side. Without the ball, they operated in a 4-5-1 with three forward players dropping in to position themselves alongside the two central midfielders to form a line of five. The same proved extremely robust and difficult for opposing sides to overcome.</p>
      <p>In order to remain compact, they didn’t press aggressively. The same was highlighted when analysing a metric called passes per defensive action (PPDA). PPDA provides an insight into how frequently a team presses, by measuring how many opposing passes are allowed before a defensive action is made to regain the ball. The lower the figure, the fewer passes a team allow before pressing.</p>
      <p>In this season, Newcastle’s PPDA rose to 12.6 compared to 9.3 in the Championship in the season before.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Within Benitez’s 4-2-3-1, the two holding midfielders playing in the double-pivot were tasked with winning the ball in the middle and quickly transitioning into attacks by playing direct vertical passes into the feet of the four attacking players in front.</p>
      <p>Perez was a key player in this setup and would often occupy the No 10, creating spaces for team-mates through his clever movement and playing through balls for the strikers leading the line, usually Gayle or Joselu.</p>
      <p>In the wide areas, Atsu on the left would drop deeper to receive possession, while Ritchie on the right would stay more advanced, receiving the ball into feet and then looking to cut in onto his favoured left foot to take shots towards goals.  Wing-backs still played a huge part in Newcastle’s attacks, but Yedlin was more heavily relied upon compared to Dummett on the opposite flank.</p>
      <p>While they scored a mid-ranking 39 goals across the course of the campaign, they conceded just 47 times, which was bettered by only six other Premier League sides, five of which finished in the top six.</p>
      <p>Their return to England’s top tier saw them finish a very respectful 10th, with Benitez rightfully attracting plenty of praise.</p>
      <h4>Patience runs out</h4>
      <p>Ahead of the new season, the Newcastle board dug their heels in during talks over a new deal for Benitez and were reluctant to provide money to spend until the Spaniard had signed the deal already on the table. This created tension between both parties.</p>
      <p>While contract disputes became a theme of the season, the Newcastle hierarchy did at least green light a move for Yoshinori Muto, a player Benitez was keen to bring to the North East. They also confirmed a loan deal for Salomon Rondon and completed a deadline-day purchase of Federico Fernandez, while <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/fabian-schar">Fabian Schar</a> also arrived on a cut-price deal.</p>
      <p>However, that sketchy pre-season period seemed to filter into Newcastle’s opening few matches of the season and after five fixtures, they were third from bottom with just one point on the board. United would go 10 games before winning their first match of the season.</p>
      <p>After an extremely disappointing 3-0 home defeat to West Ham, Benitez knew he needed to adjust his sides set up in order to change their fortunes. The Spaniard therefore implemented a 5-4-1 formation. Without the ball, the same proved extremely robust and difficult for opposing sides to overcome.</p>
      <p>Bentiez’s preferred back three was Lejeune, Schar and captain Jaamal Lascelles. All three were comfortable in possession and would often spread out horizontally to add width to their play and allow wing backs to push higher up the pitch and support forwards in attacks.</p>
      <p>The two central midfielders would have different roles with one sitting in front of the back-four, regaining and recycling possession whilst the other would be given more license to roam from box-to-box.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.chroniclelive.co.uk/incoming/article16123265.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Leicester-City-v-Newcastle-United-Premier-League.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Ayoze Perez of Newcastle United celebrates with teammate Miguel Almiron of Newcastle United after scoring his team's first goal during the Premier League match between Leicester City and Newcastle United<cite>(Image: Getty Images)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Bentiez would often instruct his side to veer away from looking to dominate a game through possession and instead command them to sit back and soak up pressure before transitioning as quickly as possible using direct passing.</p>
      <p>To do this, they would often play a ball long into wide areas looking to utilise the likes Perez and January new boy Miguel Almiron to break at speed and catch out a disorganised defence. They also had the option of firing the ball forward to Rondon who would look to hold the ball up while attacking players broke forward to support him.</p>
      <p>The switch proved to be another shrewd tactical success for Benitez, with United going onto lose just nine of the following 24 league matches and comfortably avoiding the drop after finishing nine points clear of the relegation zone.</p>
      <p>It proved no platform to build on however and Benitez left the club in June upon expiry of his contract. The relationship with the board has clearly reached a point of no return and he didn't feel the club matched his long-term ambitions. His departure was a hammer blow to the vast support who idolised the Spaniard.</p>
      <h4>The impact left behind</h4>
      <p>The club replaced Benitez with <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/steve-bruce">Steve Bruce,</a> which left many fans frustrated. Bruce is a well -respected manager but he was not as highly regarded as Benitez and was plying his trade with Sheffield Wednesday in the Championship last season.</p>
      <p>However, the Englishman has done a good job with United to date, with his side occupying 13th in the table following a run of three wins in their previous five Premier League matches. He has done well to maintain some of the structured philosophies installed by Benitez, while also steadying United through turbulent waters and keeping them competitive in a demanding division.</p>
      <p>While Bruce deserves credit for what he has achieved so far, there is an underlying feeling that he may also be benefiting from some of the hard work done by his predecessor in terms of build a defensively robust side capable of grinding out results and punching above their weight.</p>
      <p>There is no doubt that the club, on the pitch at least, is in a much better state now, than prior to Benitez’s arrival, and for this he deserves credit. Both parties may have gone their separate ways, but as we move into 2020, Benitez will be remembered as the most influential character at the club in this decade.</p>
