      <h1>David Duckenfield a 'target for blame' over Hillsborough tragedy, court told</h1>
      <h2>Jurors urged not to judge match commander by 'artificial' standards</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:08:41+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/joe-thomas/" target="_blank">Joe Thomas</a></address>
      <p>Jurors sitting on the retrial of David Duckenfield were told he had become a "target of blame" for the Hillsborough disaster.</p>
      <p>Benjamin Myers, QC, urged them not to apply "artificial" standards when considering the actions of the police match commander at the tragic 1989 FA Cup semi-final.</p>
      <p>He argued structural problems with the stadium and failures by others contributed to a tragedy that nobody foresaw as he continued the defence closing speech.</p>
      <p>Mr Myers said the prosecution of his client was "fundamentally unfair" as he laid out his argument on behalf of the 75-year-old.</p>
      <p>The case has heard that, eight minutes before Liverpool's tie with Nottingham Forest was due to kick-off, Duckenfield agreed to open stadium gates to relieve congestion outside turnstiles allocated to supporters of the Anfield club.</p>
      <p>Many of those who then entered used a tunnel to access the central pens of the Leppings Lane terrace, where a fatal crush developed.</p>
      <p>Ninety six men, women and children died as a result.</p>

      <p>Duckenfield denies the gross negligence manslaughter of 95 of those who died.</p>
      <p>Mr Myers told the jury: "We do have to approach the evidence with balance and with fairness and fairness to David Duckenfield, that man who has been a target of blame for this for such a long time."</p>
      <p>He said the prosecution was unfair because it singled out Duckenfield and applied different standards to him.</p>
      <p>Mr Myers highlighted the over-calculation of the capacity of the Leppings Lane terraces and the failure of crush barriers and pitch perimeter gates to conform to advisory standards as factors beyond the defendant's control.</p>
      <p>Referring to reports of crushing on the terrace at FA Cup semi-finals in 1981 and 1988, he argued the stadium was on a "knife edge".</p>
      <p>He said: "It is like giving a captain a ship that is already sinking."</p>
      <p>Further factors beyond Duckenfield's control included changes to the division of turnstiles at the Leppings Lane end and a reduction of police under the match commander's control compared to the FA Cup semi-final between the same teams in 1988, he told Preston Crown Court.</p>
      <p>Mr Myers said Duckenfield, who was promoted less than three weeks before the tragedy, effectively inherited a matchday police plan that had been drawn up by others and based on the previous year's semi-final, which had been considered a success within policing circles.</p>
      <p>He told the court: "We say David Duckenfield did do what he was expected to do as match commander. He didn't breach his duty, he did what he was expected to do in difficult circumstances."</p>
      <p>He described not delaying kick-off after discussions within the police control box around 30 minutes before the game, not opening exit gates when this was first requested and then later ordering them to be opened as decisions taken by Duckenfield in the build-up to the disaster.</p>
      <p>And he argued no-one predicted fans would all go straight down the tunnel after entering through Gate C.</p>
      <p>Mr Myers asked the jury to keep in mind that in the 1980s violence and disorder at football matches was a "huge problem".</p>
      <p>He said: "The threat of hooliganism and crowd disorder and violence cast a huge shadow over the way football was policed."</p>
      <p>Mr Myers also suggested ticketless supporters, supporters arriving later than the year before, and supporters who "pushed" as they joined the back of the crowds waiting to get in, contributed to the issues already caused by the turnstile arrangements.</p>
      <p>His comments came after the judge, Sir Peter Openshaw, told the court a juror would be discharged following a bereavement.</p>
      <p>The case will continue with a panel of 10 jurors, seven women and three men, after another juror was discharged earlier this month.</p>
      <p>*Duckenfield is not charged in relation to Tony Bland, the 96th supporter to die as a result of the tragedy.</p>
      <p>Laws at the time prevented prosecution when someone died more than 366 days after sustaining injury. Mr Bland died in 1993.</p>
