        <li>President <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-donald-trump-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-4">Donald Trump</a> said his wife, First Lady Melania Trump, was completely caught off-guard by his surprise Saturday visit to Walter Reed Medical Center and wondered if he had a heart attack.</li>
        <li>“My wife said, ‘Darling are you okay? What’s wrong? Oh, they’re reporting you may have had a heart attack.’ I said, ‘Why did I have a heart attack?’ ‘Because you went to Walter Reed Medical Center,'” Trump recounted at his Tuesday cabinet meeting.</li>
        <li>On Saturday, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said Trump “decided to go to Walter Reed and kind of get a head start with some routine checkups as part of his annual exam.”</li>
        <li>In his Tuesday remarks, Trump blasted the media for speculating about the unscheduled Walter Reed visit and denounced them as “dangerous” and “corrupt” for raising questions.</li>

      <p>In remarks at his Tuesday cabinet meeting, President <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-donald-trump-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-4">Donald Trump</a> said his wife, First Lady Melania Trump, was completely caught off-guard by his surprise Saturday visit to Walter Reed Medical Center and wondered if he was OK.</p>
      <p>“I went for a physical, and I came back. My wife said, ‘Darling are you okay? What’s wrong? Oh, they’re reporting you may have had a heart attack.’ I said, ‘Why did I have a heart attack?’ ‘Because you went to Walter Reed Medical Center,’ that’s where we go when we get the physicals,” <a href="https://twitter.com/dcexaminer/status/1196854532715765767">Trump said at the cabinet meeting.</a></p>
      <p>On Saturday, Trump made a mysterious, unplanned trip to Walter Reed hospital, a military hospital in Bethesda, Maryland.</p>

      <p>“Visited a great family of a young man under major surgery at the amazing Walter Reed Medical Center. Those are truly some of the best doctors anywhere in the world. Also began phase one of my yearly physical. Everything very good (great!). Will complete next year,” <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1195931893998456832">Trump tweeted on Saturday.</a></p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-is-healthy-as-can-be-white-house-press-secretary-says-after-doctor-visit/2019/11/17/b676ee50-0958-11ea-bd9d-c628fd48b3a0_story.html">That day on Fox News,</a> White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said Trump had “a really busy year ahead” so he “decided to go to Walter Reed and kind of get a head start with some routine checkups as part of his annual exam.”</p>
      <p>Grisham’s statement immediately <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/11/18/20970407/trump-walter-reed-hospital-trip-explained">raised questions and doubts</a>, given that the White House has an advanced medical staff on its premises to deal with any health issues that come up, and routine physical check-ups usually just take one visit, and are not done in parts.</p>
      <p>In his Tuesday remarks, Trump blasted the media for speculating about the unscheduled Walter Reed visit and denounced them as “dangerous” and “corrupt” for raising questions.</p>
      <p>“I was greeted with the news that I had a heart attack, I was greeted by our people in PR that I had a heart attack…these people are sick,” <a href="https://twitter.com/dcexaminer/status/1196854532715765767">he said of the media.</a> “The press really, in this country, is dangerous. We don’t have freedom of speech in this country, we have the opposite. We have a very corrupt media, and I hope they can get their act together.”</p>
