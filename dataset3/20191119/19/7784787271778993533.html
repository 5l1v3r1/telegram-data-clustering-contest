      <p>But on Tuesday night, the <a href="https://www.foxsports.com.au/nrl/nrl-premiership/nrl-2020-valentine-holmes-to-sign-for-north-queensland-cowboys-latrell-mitchell-contract-news-wests-tigers/news-story/a5e4b14796fd94a19abf4b13dc3216d1">Courier Mail revealed the Cowboys were set to sign Holmes on a $1 million a season deal</a>, effectively ruling them out of pursuing 22-year-old Mitchell due to salary cap constraints.</p>
      <p>It leaves the Tigers, who last week publicly declared their interest in Mitchell, as the last remaining suitor for the talented centre.</p>
      <p>“There’s no point in being coy about it,” Wests Tigers chairman Lee Hagipantelis said.</p>
      <p>“Latrell is a huge asset to any organisation, a quality player, a quality gentleman on and off the field.</p>

      <p>“He would bring an enormous amount of gravitas to a club like the Tigers, it would be a huge endorsement of the Tigers.”</p>
      <p>According to Nine News, The Tigers have put a four-year, $4 million contract on the table which would make Mitchell the highest paid player at the club.</p>
      <p>It is understood the Tigers want Mitchell to play fullback despite <a href="https://www.foxsports.com.au/nrl/nrl-premiership/teams/tigers/braith-anasta-backs-latrell-mitchell-to-join-tigers-just-not-at-fullback-and-not-for-1m-a-season/news-story/62d88a6855c50d196026317edee259c9">concerns from former players surrounding his fitness.</a></p>

      <p>“You’ve got to be the fittest player on the field, you’ve got to be on the ball, on the move, 24/7 while you’re in that position. I don’t think Latrell is ready for that,” former NRL great Braith Anasta said.</p>
      <p>“I think he’s just got to ice that centre position and play the full 80 minutes at the highest level, that’s what he’s got to do.”</p>
      <p>The Sydney Roosters are all but resigned to losing Mitchell having pulled an $800,000 a season deal and told the NSW and Australian representative he is free to negotiate with other clubs.</p>
