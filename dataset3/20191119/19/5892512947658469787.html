      <p><a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/10/24/20929540/midnight-mania-jon-jones-insult-suicidal-tony-ferguson-ufc">Move over Jon Jones</a>, there’s a new “tweet and delete” kid in town.</p>
      <p>Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) middleweight title contender, Paulo Costa, probably thought he was talking tough when calling Israel Adesanya a “pussy African” on Twitter, until someone with some actual brains told him to delete it.</p>
      <p>Ironically, “The Eraser” won’t be able to rub this out, because the Internet is forever.</p>

      <p>Costa was expected to get the next crack at the 185-pound crown; however, bicep surgery sent him to the sidelines until further notice, prompting UFC to consider a showdown <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/10/30/20939803/israel-adesanya-and-yoel-romero-are-planning-to-fight-and-paulo-costa-laughing-both-them-mma">between Adesanya and longtime title contender, Yoel Romero</a>.</p>
      <p>Assuming that scenario plays out in early 2020, “The Eraser” will no doubt be in line for the winner, unless Jared Cannonier or Darren Till do something spectacular between now and then, which is a possibility when you consider <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/11/14/20964652/darren-till-accepts-callout-agrees-fight-robert-whittaker-ufc-london-mma">this opportunity</a>.</p>
      <p>“The Last Stylebender” has yet to respond to this latest attack.</p>
