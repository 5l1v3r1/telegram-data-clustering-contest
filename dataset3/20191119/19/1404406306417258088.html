      <h1>Kodak Black Reportedly Seeking to Serve Part of Prison Sentence in Rehab Facility</h1>

      <p>Kodak Black is reportedly looking to serve part of his 46-month sentence in a rehab facility, according to legal documents obtained by Complex. Kodak's legal team is looking for the Floridian to take part in the Residential Drug Abuse Program (RDAP) with a recommendation from the Assistant United States Attorney Bruce Brown. </p>
      <p>RDAP is a voluntary program that allows inmates with substance abuse histories to participate in nine months worth of therapy sessions, both group and one-on-one, as well as school and vocational training. After completing the requisite 500-hours for the program, those incarcerated for non-violent offenses can receive sentence reductions and "limited financial rewards."</p>
      <p>Kodak's eligibility may be in question if indicted on assault charges associated with the reported prison fight last month. "While a pending charge, if such be indicted, may affect the Defendant’s eligibility (for RDAP), the defense would ask the Court at this juncture to make the recommendation."</p>
