      <p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2019/40544"><i>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</i></a>’s 725 shotgun is truly incredible. Not only did it dominate the first couple of weeks of the game’s multiplayer, but it’s now on its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/12/20961861/modern-warfare-nov-12-patch-725-shotgun-nerf-footsteps">third round of nerfs</a>. In the latest <i>Modern Warfare</i> patch, released on Tuesday morning, Infinity Ward has taken yet another shot at nerfing the game’s most stubborn weapon.</p>
      <p>This time around the nerfs to the 725 are significant, or at least they should be. The gun, which first earned its reputation for being over-powered when <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/11/4/20947809/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-recoil-kilo-141-m13-mp5-725">players noticed you could use it to snipe across an entire map</a>, is getting another range damage reduction. This time instead of just the basic stats, Infinity Ward is also tweaking how much attachments can affect the range damage of the weapon. The 725 is also getting a larger spread when fired from the hip, and reduced hip-fire damage.</p>
      <p>Will this be enough to stop half the players in every match from using the gun? Based on its history, probably not. It seems like only an act of God or Infinity Ward removing the gun completely will slow it down, but the developer is trying its best, so hopefully this patch will help a little bit.</p>
      <p>For a look at everything that’s changing in Tuesday’s <i>Modern Warfare</i> patch, you can find the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/dyo8gj/111919_patch_notes/">full patch notes</a> below.</p>
