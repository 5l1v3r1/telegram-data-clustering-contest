      <h1>Nigerian govt postpones Abuja Carnival 2019</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:07:24+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/more-news/364158-nigerian-govt-postpones-abuja-carnival-2019.html" target="_blank">Oge Udegbunam</a></address>
      <p>Nigeria’s Ministry of Information and Culture has rescheduled the 2019 Abuja Carnival.</p>
      <p>The announcement was contained in a statement sent to PREMIUM TIMES by the ministry’s spokesperson, Joseph Metu, on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>In April 2019, the Guardian Newspaper reported how a new date for the annual Abuja carnival was disclosed.</p>
      <p>According to the newspaper, the carnival was to hold from November 23 – 25. The earlier postponement was to enable the ministry plan adequately for a robust event.</p>
      <p>A new date is yet to be announced for this second postponement.</p>
      <p>“The Ministry apologises to all invited guests for any inconvenience the postponement might have caused,” the statement said.</p>
      <h4>Funding challenge?</h4>
      <p>Earlier, the minister, Lai Mohammed, was reported as seeking sponsorship from arts and culture outfits to support the carnival.</p>
      <p>He noted that organising “a befitting carnival” requires serious funding.</p>
      <p>Also, he stressed the need for restructuring the cultural fiesta ”to be purposeful and colourful at the same time, with sponsorship from art and culture enthusiasts”.</p>
      <p>“If we restructure the carnival in a manner that our finances can handle, we will do it. The key to this is sponsorship.</p>
      <p>“We hope to persuade culture enthusiasts and multinationals to partner with us. We are talking to a couple of them,” he had said.</p>
      <p>Mr Mohammed confirmed that 21 states had shown interest in participating at the carnival, adding that ”with God’s and stakeholders’ support, the carnival would be held”.</p>
