      <h1>Second runway may not materialise</h1>
      <h2>ILS enables landing from both sides of existing runway</h2>

      <p>Notwithstanding the provision for a second runway in the original blueprint of Cochin International Airport Limited (CIAL), it may not be forthcoming any time soon owing to operational and logistical reasons.</p>
      <p>A second runway was proposed along the northern side from the very outset, when the airport was proposed. However, it was kept in abeyance in the face of logistical hiccups and resistance involved in land acquisition.</p>
      <p>So, rather than delaying the project for a second runway, which was superfluous for a nascent airport, the board of directors of the airport company decided to go ahead with a single runway.</p>
      <p>Though the airport has completed over two decades of operations, CIAL sources said a second runway remained far from imminent by comparing aircraft handling statistics of the Kochi airport with the one in Mumbai, the busiest in the world with single runway operations.</p>
      <h3>Mumbai airport</h3>
      <p>For instance, last year, the Mumbai airport broke its own record multiple times before breaching the benchmark of 1,000 flights a day in December.</p>
      <p>It handled 1,004 flights on that day that included 903 scheduled flights, 59 non-scheduled flights, eight charter flights, 31 freighter movements and three military operations.</p>
      <p>“Compared to that, the Kochi airport still handles only 240 services a day, which means it can continue to operate with a single runway even after a four-fold increase in flights from what is now,” said CIAL sources.</p>
      <h3>New system</h3>
      <p>Besides, it is also pointed out that at least technically, the airport has two runways now with the induction of an Instrumental Landing System (ILS) a year ago that facilitates landing from both sides of the existing runway. Initially, the landing was possible along the eastern side of the runway while the induction of the ILS has now made landing possible from the western side as well.</p>
      <p>The complications of land acquisition also make the proposal for a second runway less attractive.</p>
      <p>The Kochi airport may need 400 to 500 acres of land if it plans for a second runway.</p>
