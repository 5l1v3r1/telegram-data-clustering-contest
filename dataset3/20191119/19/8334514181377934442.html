      <p>STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - The United Arab Emirates intends to buy two additional GlobalEye aircraft for surveillance from Saab (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/companies/SAABb.ST">SAABb.ST</a>), the Swedish defense firm said on Tuesday, lifting its shares by 3%.</p>
      <p>Stockholm-based Saab, maker of the Gripen fighter jet, said the order’s potential value was $1.018 billion although final negotiations had yet to take place and a contract amendment needed to be signed.</p>
      <p>The UAE previously bought three GlobalEye aircraft, which provide simultaneous air, maritime and ground surveillance. It bought two in 2015 and another in 2017.</p>
      <p>Saab said the Gulf state announced its intention at the Dubai Airshow on Tuesday to amend the contract.</p>
      <p>The Swedish company raised 6 billion crowns ($624 million) last year to boost its balance sheet and meet a growing order backlog.</p>
      <p>Saab’s shares were up 2.7% by 1122 GMT.</p>
