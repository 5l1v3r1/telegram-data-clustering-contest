      <h1>‘Act one of today’s circus is over’: Nunes mocks Democrats at end of morning impeachment hearing</h1>

      <p>California Rep. Devin Nunes claimed Democrats were “no closer” to impeaching President Trump after Tuesday’s morning hearing than they were the day he was elected.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, Lt. Col. <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/read-opening-statements-from-alexander-vindman-and-jennifer-williams">Alexander Vindman and Jennifer Williams</a>, a foreign service aide to Vice President Mike Pence's office, delivered their public testimony before the House Intelligence Committee.</p>
      <p>Nunes called the hearings “nonsense” and claimed there was no evidence provided in any of the hearings that warranted impeachment.</p>
      <p>“Act one of today’s circus is over,” Nunes said in his closing remarks. “For those of you who have been watching at home, the Democrats are no closer to impeachment than where they were three years ago.”</p>
      <p>He claimed the intelligence community and the State Department have “suffered long-term damage” as a result of the impeachment effort, adding, “The Democrats can continue to poison the America people with this nonsense, but we sat here all morning without any evidence for impeachment.”</p>
      <p>Nunes chalked up the impeachment effort to “policy disagreements” between House Democrats and Trump. “I would say it is astonishing, but that is putting too little emphasis on their actions.”</p>
      <p>The California Republican had several heated exchanges with Vindman during the hearing. <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/vindman-chides-nunes-its-lieutenant-colonel-vindman-please">Vindman chastised Nunes</a> for referring to him as “Mr. Vindman” instead of “Lieutenant Colonel Vindman.”</p>
