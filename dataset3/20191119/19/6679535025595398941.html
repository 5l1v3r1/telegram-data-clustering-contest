      <p>Members of the Mathru Bhasha Madhyama Vedika, who are opposing the State government’s decision to replace Telugu with English as the primary medium of instruction in all government-run schools, have taken strong objection to what they have termed as attempts “to give a political and religious colour” to the issue.</p>
      <p>“While it is a good sign that the issue is being extensively debated by educationists, social activists and littérateurs, the issue should be looked at purely from an academic perspective,” said a statement that was released by the association on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>“ We are not opposed to implementation of English as the medium of instruction but it should be done in a systematic manner with proper planning and homework,” the release added.</p>
      <p>The members said that the government should impose restrictions on private schools and demanded that the mother-tongue be used as the medium of instruction in primary schools.</p>
      <p>The members further suggested that English language could be strengthened through the implementation of common school system.</p>
