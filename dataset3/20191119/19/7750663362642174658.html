      <h1>Manchester United lining up new Eric Bailly contract?</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/"><b>Manchester United</b></a> are reportedly keen to extend <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/eric-bailly/"><b>Eric Bailly</b></a>'s stay at Old Trafford past the end of the season.</h2>

      <p>The defender, who is currently sidelined with a serious knee injury, is due to become a free agent when his contract expires in the summer.</p>
      <p>Given the Ivory Coast international's injury record, it appeared uncertain whether United would attempt to renew the 25-year-old's deal.</p>
      <p>However, according to <i>The Sun</i>, the Premier League giants will make every effort to ensure that Bailly does not depart the club for nothing.</p>
      <p>The former Villarreal man has made just seven appearances in all competitions since the start of 2019, although United expect him to be available at some point in December.</p>
