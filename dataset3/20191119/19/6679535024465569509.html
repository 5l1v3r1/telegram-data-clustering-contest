      <p>The curtains went up on the Thiruvananthapuram Revenue District School Arts Festival here on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Minister for Tourism and Devaswom Kadakampally Surendran formally launched the four-day event at a ceremony held at the Government Model Boys Higher Secondary School in Chala.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the occasion, Mr. Surendran said that school arts festival remained a beacon of hope for the Stateâ€™s secular fabric, even at a time when rituals and traditions were being differentiated on the basis of religion and caste.</p>
      <p>He added that the annual event had played a crucial role in popularising art forms that were confined within various social boundaries.</p>
      <p>The Minister also said arts festivals had played a significant role in propagating progressive ideals and ushering in social transformation over the years. They were also been instrumental in reviving numerous dying art forms, he said.</p>
      <p>Earlier, the festival got under way after C. Manoj Kumar, Deputy Director of Education, Thiruvananthapuram, hoisted the festival flag.</p>
      <p>As many as 296 competitions will be conducted in 12 venues that have been arranged at the Government Model Boys Higher Secondary School, Chala; Government Girls High School, Chala; Government Central High School, Attakulangara; Government Tamil Higher Secondary School, Chala; Old District Educational Office, and State Institute of Educational Management and Training (SIEMAT) Hall, Attakulangara.</p>
      <p>Numerous contestants from schools in 12 sub-districts in the revenue district will compete against one another in the festival.</p>
      <p>Thiruvananthapuram Mayor K. Sreekumar presided over the function. O. Rajagopal, MLA, Thiruvananthapuram Corporation councillors Sudarsanan C., M.R. Gopan, Lakshmi M., Thiruvananthapuram Regional Deputy Director Narayani E.S. and school principal Leena M. were also present on the occasion.</p>
