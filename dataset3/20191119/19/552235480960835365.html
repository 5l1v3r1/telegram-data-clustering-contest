      <h1>What channel is Scotland vs Kazakhstan? Live stream, TV and kick-off details</h1>
      <h2>It's the second game of Scotland's Euro 2020 double header as they look to build on the win against Cyprus.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:15:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:15</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Doyle, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/chris-doyle/</a></address>
      <p>Another dead rubber in the context of Group I, yes, but another chance for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scotland-football-team">Scotland</a> to build momentum ahead of the play-offs.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/steve-clarke">Steve Clarke</a> unconvincingly edged past Cyprus at the weekend now they've got revenge on their minds.</p>
      <p>Kazakhstan humiliated Alex McLeish's Scots in Astana earlier this year and they visit Hampden looking to do it all over again.</p>
      <p>A positive result can at least put right some of the wrongs of that horrific night.</p>
      <p>It's also the last bit of international action before the playoff in March, and the final chance for players to impress.</p>
      <p>Here's all the details you need to know ahead of the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/euro-2020">Euro 2020</a> clash.</p>
