      <h1>Blow your 2020 budget on this 98-inch Samsung 8K TV you absolutely deserve ($40,000 off)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:24:43+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/author/zach-laidlaw/" target="_blank">Zach Laidlaw</a></address>
      <p>Televisions rocking 4K displays are <i>so</i> this decade. The second coming of the roaring 20s will be headlined by a new wave of display technology that is so indiscernible from reality, you'll never want to get up from your couch (wait, isn't this how <i>Wall-E</i> started?). Get a jumpstart on the future with this gigantic, absurdly specced, don't-need-it-but-know-you-want-it <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/televisions-home-theater/tvs/qled-8k-tvs/98-class-q900-qled-smart-8k-uhd-tv-2019-qn98q900rbfxza/">8K Samsung SmartTV, going for a moderate annual salary of $60,000 ($40,000 off) over on Samsung's website</a>.</p>
      <p>Okay, we know you probably have some pretty important purchases to make before you cross this one off your list — a new car, downpayment on a house, or 33 orders of <a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/11/15/samsungs-black-friday-deals-solid-galaxy-s9-chromebook-tv-discounts/">Samsung's 75" 4K Smart TV that's also on sale right now</a> — but that doesn't make it any less desirable. This behemoth is the pinnacle of viewing experiences. It's got a colossal 98" 8K (7,680 x 4,320) LED display, an auto upscaling feature to improve the look of inferior 4K content, and an overkill Quantum Processor for powering all those pixels.</p>

      <p>If you're dying to get one of these fellas into your home theater, weekend villa, or 90-foot yacht (hey, we don't judge), you can order one now over on Samsung's website, possibly pending a hard inquiry on your credit score and a background check to boot. Normal retail price is $100K, so this offer is basically a steal, which is what your neighbors will probably do when they get wind of your new investment. Don't leave the box out on the curb on trash day.</p>
