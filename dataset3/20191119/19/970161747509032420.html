      <p>A woman who sent a bomb to former President <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/barack-obama/">Barack Obama</a> was reportedly caught because of her pet cat.</p>
      <p>Julia Poff, a 46-year-old woman from Spring, Texas, was sentenced to ten years in prison on Monday for sending an explosive parcel addressed to the former president at the White House in October 2016.</p>
      <p>Investigators later examined the package and found a cat hair under the address label. The FBI crime lab analyzed the hair and connected to one of Poff’s cat’s, according to court records.</p>
      <p>Poff, who worked at a fireworks stand also sent homemade explosive devices to Texas Governor Greg Abbott and Social Security Administration Commissioner Carolyn Colvin.</p>
      <p>Governor Abbot opened the package, but it did not explode because ‘he did not open it as designed,’ according to court records.</p>

      <p>In a court order filed in November 2017, United States magistrate Judge Frances Stacy wrote: ‘Had the device exploded, it could have caused severe burns and death.’</p>

      <p>Abbott’s package contained and a cigarette box containing multiple types of incendiary powders, which was connected to a fuse. It also contained a salad dressing cap Poff bought for her anniversary dinner that led investigators to her.</p>
      <p>A Texas tobacco stamp on the cigarette box also helped lead authorities to Poff. The homemade explosive device came in a package that still had an ‘obliterated shipping label’ addressed to Poff, according to court documents.</p>
      <p>Investigators said Poff did not get support from her ex-husband and blamed Abbott, who was the Texas attorney general at the time, although it is unclear why.</p>
      <p>She applied for Social Security benefits, but her applications were denied, according to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/24/us/mail-bombs-obama-abbott.html">New York Times.</a></p>
      <p>Poff also reportedly said in court that she did not like President Obama.</p>
      <p>She pleaded guilty to transporting explosives with intent to kill in July.</p>
