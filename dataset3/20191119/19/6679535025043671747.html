      <h2>Survivors learn to move ahead with confidence at KEM Hospital camp, seek more sensitivity</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:54:30+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Jyoti-Shelar-3618/" target="_blank">Jyoti Shelar</a></address>
      <p>Eight years ago, Khar resident Bhairavi Nirbhavane (20) was blindsided when the flames of her gas stove leapt at her while she was cooking. She sustained 45% burns, which in medical terms, is severe.</p>
      <p>The scars on her neck, chest and hands remain after seven reconstructive plastic surgeries. “They kind of define me now,” says the hostess with Bar Stock Exchange.</p>
      <p>Day after day, Ms. Nirbhavane lives through more than the trauma of the burns. “I am open to questions, but I hate it when people keep staring,” she says.</p>
      <p>Like Ms. Nirbhavane, Akanksha Murudkar (22), a bakery and pastry chef with ITC Fortune Hotels, has adapted to life with scars. At the age of 13, Ms. Murudkar was watching her mother fry pakoras when an accidental splash of water in the oil scalded her neck and chest. “I could not turn my neck because of the contractures,” said the Airoli resident, who has undergone five plastic surgeries.</p>
      <p>While pain and the psychological scars run deep, the women moved beyond their experience to help others with similar issues. They are volunteers with Camp Ashakiran, a recreational retreat for children with burn scars and deformities, organised by KEM Hospital’s plastic surgery department.</p>
      <h3>Gaining confidence</h3>
      <p>The sixth such camp was organised in Karjat from November 8 to 10. “As children with burn scars, both of us had attended the camp. That’s where we met and became friends,” said Ms. Nirbhavane. The confidence she developed after attending the camps helped her to give up using a scarf to cover her wounds. Besides Camp Ashakiran, Ms. Nirbhavane attended a burns youth camp in Taiwan years ago.</p>
      <p>“I mostly wear long sleeves. But that’s mainly because I don’t want to scare people around me, especially children,” she said.</p>
      <p>While recovering from their injuries, both struggled a lot in school and college. “When I went back to school after almost a year, my classmates would stare at me constantly. In college, I made very few friends but it eased gradually,” said Ms. Murudkar.</p>
      <p>A lot of her confidence and determination came from attending the survivor camps, including one in the U.S. “There was a phase when I hardly met people. But in the camps, when I met others like me who were pursuing all kinds of things, it made me positive,” she said.</p>
      <p>Her first real test came soon after she cleared the hotel management entrance and got selected to the Dadar catering college. The principal asked her if she was sure she wanted to take it up as this was one place where appearance mattered to campus recruiters. But there was no way Ms. Murudkar could be stopped. “I was determined,” she said.</p>
      <p>While she continues to wear a scarf all the time, it is only to avoid dust-driven infections and stares.</p>
      <h3>Please don’t stare</h3>
      <p>Stepping out of home every day can be a challenge, said Ms. Nirbhavane. Students in college often referred to her in Marathi as <i>jalaleli </i>(the burnt one). She has also been asked if she had a tattoo on her neck. Clearly, “our society has to evolve.”</p>
      <p>In sharp contrast, when Ms. Murudkar visited the U.S. with a group of burn survivors, they were looked at once, and that was it. “There was no awkward, curious staring.”</p>
      <p>All they want from people, she said, is that they do not treat them differently, or look at them differently. “Just let us be.” Burn injuries not only leave scars on the body but also on the mind. Experts say children find it more difficult to adjust as compared to adults.</p>
      <h3>Benefits of camps</h3>
      <p>“There is a lot of research on children that has shown that scars and deformities cause psychological trauma, and they often lose their confidence,” said Dr. Vinita Puri, head of KEM Hospital’s plastic surgery department and one of the directors of Camp Ashakiran.</p>
      <p>A 2007 article in the Journal of Burn Care and Research stated that there is a significant improvement in burn victims’ self-esteem from the beginning to the end of camps, with an integration into the camp community. “Such camps have been taking place in the U.S. since the 1980s. Ours is India’s first such camp,” said Dr. Puri.</p>
      <p>The camp was earlier known as ‘Karma’, and was renamed this year. The participants — 13 boys and 11 girls in the age group of seven to 15 years, including a seven-year-old double amputee — engaged in games, dance and drama, and interacted with each other. “The aim of the camp is to help survivors tide over the mental and psychological trauma,” said Dr. Puri.</p>
      <p>Karma may have been the past, which they left behind. Right now, their story is about renewing themselves.</p>
