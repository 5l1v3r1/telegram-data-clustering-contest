      <h1>T.Y. Hilton Updates His Injury Status Before Thursday’s Game</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:39:57+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:39</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>Indianapolis Colts WR T.Y. Hilton has missed the team’s last three games due to a calf injury. But there’s optimism he’ll return to action this Thursday against divisional rival Houston.</p>
      <p>Hilton suffered a calf injury during practice back in October. He’s missed games against the Steelers, Dolphins and Jaguars as a result. The Colts are 1-2 without him.</p>
      <p>
        <b>So what will it take for Hilton to play on Thursday Night Football against the Texans in a pivotal AFC South Division contest? According to the latest report from Joel Erickson of the Indianapolis Star, the star WR will play “if I <a href="https://twitter.com/JoelAErickson/status/1196850393927634945">check all the boxes</a>.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>Those “boxes” include getting clearance from the doctors first, then the coaching staff. If Hilton gets the green light from both parties, he’ll play on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The Colts would really love to have him available for Thursday Night Football. Indianapolis and Houston are both in the thick of the AFC Playoff hunt. The Colts currently lead the division at 6-4 and own the tiebreaker over the Texans due to beating them in week 7.</p>
      <p>Another Indianapolis victory on Thursday would further the team’s lead in the division, getting one step closer to clinching a playoff berth.</p>
      <p>Hilton is hoping to play. But he’ll have to wait a few more days to see if he’s been fully cleared for live action.</p>
