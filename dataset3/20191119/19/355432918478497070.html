      <h1>Poll: Biden and Warren are neck and neck in California</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:35:23+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/tal-axelrod" target="_blank">Tal Axelrod</a></address>
      <p>Former Vice President <a href="https://thehill.com/people/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a> and Sen. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/elizabeth-warren">Elizabeth Warren</a> (D-Mass.) are neck and neck in California’s delegate-rich primary, according to a new <a href="https://www.ppic.org/wp-content/uploads/ppic-statewide-survey-californians-and-their-government-november-2019.pdf">Public Policy Institute of California poll</a> released Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The poll shows Biden currently has the support of 24 percent of likely Democratic primary voters, while Warren has 23 percent support among the same respondents. Sen. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/bernie-sanders">Bernie Sanders</a> (I-Vt.) comes in third at 17 percent, while no other candidate breaks double digits.</p>
      <p>Nine percent were still unsure of who they will support in the March contest.</p>
      <p>Biden and Warren both bolstered their standings in the poll by taking leads with traditionally supportive demographics. Biden has a 30 percent to 18 percent advantage with men and a 31 percent to 18 percent edge with voters 45 and older, while Warren has a 26 percent to 19 percent lead with women and a 30 percent to 10 percent advantage with voters aged 18-44.</p>
      <p>Likely primary voters largely said they prioritize a candidate’s ability to defeat <a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a> in the general election over ideological agreements. Fifty-five percent of likely voters polled said it is more important to nominate the candidate who seems most likely to beat Trump, while 36 percent said it is important to nominate someone with positions on the issues that come closest to theirs.</p>
      <p>California is one of several states to hold their primaries and caucuses on March 3, dubbed Super Tuesday due to the amount of nominating contests held that day. The Golden State is set to allocate a whopping <a href="https://www.cadem.org/our-party/body/FINAL-CA-2020-Delegate-Selection-Plan-Handout-1-1.pdf">495 delegates</a> based on the primary’s result, making the race a top target for either front-runner to cement their standing or for middle-tier candidates to make up ground.</p>
      <p>The poll is a warning sign for California Sen. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/kamala-harris">Kamala Harris</a> (D), who polls at 8 percent in her home state. </p>
      <p>The Public Policy Institute of California poll surveyed 682 likely voters from Nov. 3-12 and has a margin of error of 5.1 percent.</p>
