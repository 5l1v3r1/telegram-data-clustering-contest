      <p>Sabri Lamouchi has urged Nottingham Forest fans to play their part in the redevelopment of the City Ground.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Forest</a> last week revealed <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-city-ground-redevelopment-3540790">a fresh image of the proposed transformation</a> of the Trentside stadium, which will see the Peter Taylor Stand rebuilt to cater for an increased capacity of around 10,000 supporters.</p>
      <p>It is anticipated planning application for the project will be submitted before the end of this year, and should permission be granted, it is hoped work could get underway during the first half of 2020.</p>
      <p>The club are asking for fans to have their say on the proposed plans.</p>

      <p>And now Reds boss <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/sabri-lamouchi">Lamouchi</a> - who has guided them to fifth in the Championship after 15 games - has explained why he wants to see the Forest faithful play a role in developing a stadium "they deserve" - and what he hopes will stay the same about <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/city-ground">the City Ground.</a></p>
      <p>"We need to refresh, we need to make (it) more modern, more warm, more comfortable for our fans because they deserve that, and the club deserves to build the new stadium, with the same atmosphere, the same spirit, the same fans, the same noise, the same positive energy," <a href="https://twitter.com/NFFC/status/1196820428926394370">he told the club's website.</a></p>
      <p>"It's really important for the club, the feedback from our fans, because the most important people in our club are the fans.</p>
