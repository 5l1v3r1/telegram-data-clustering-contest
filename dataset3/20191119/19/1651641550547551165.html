      <h1>Huawei’s first 15 inch Matebook leaks</h1>

      <p>It seems after focussing on becoming slimmer, laptops are once again looking at increasing screen sizes. First, we had the new 15-inch Surface Laptop and then the 16-inch Macbook Pro, and today we have the first leaked render of a new Huawei Matebook which appears to have a screen size closer to 15 inches, Huawei’s largest Matebook yet.</p>

      <p>Codenamed Bohr and discovered by <a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks">Evan Blass</a>, the presumed Huawei Matebook 15 is port heavy, with a full-sized HDMI port, one USB-C port (likely thunderbolt-enabled) which is likely also used for charging, and 3 USB-A ports.</p>
      <p>Also visible in the render is Huawei’s combination fingerprint reader and instant-on power button. The bezels are of course impressively thin, with an impressive 84% screen to body ratio. Unlike the Matebook X the screen features a regular 16:9 aspect ratio which unfortunately results in a rather unsightly bottom bezel.</p>

      <p>More conventional is the new 14-inch Matebook (codenamed Nobel) with one USB-C port, 2 USB-A ports, a headphone jack and full-sized HDMI port. It also features the usual Huawei power button/ fingerprint reader combo and thin-bezel screen.</p>
      <p>It is not known when the new laptops will hit the market, but Huawei traditionally announces their Matebooks in Q1 for release in Q2, so expect to see the devices hit the market in April 2020. Hopefully, by then the company will have resolved their issues with the US government, <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/bad-news-for-microsoft-as-huawei-starts-shipping-matebooks-with-linux/">which is preventing them from launching new products with American operating systems</a>.</p>
