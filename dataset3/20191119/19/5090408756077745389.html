      <p>Two luxury yachts worth over $20 million caught fire and sank early Saturday morning in Florida.</p>
      <p>An initial group of firefighters arrived at the Universal Marine Center in Fort Lauderdale where the yachts were docked for repair at around 4:30 a.m., the <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/broward/article237442079.html">Miami Herald</a> reported.</p>
      <p>By the time the firefighters arrived, both boats were already engulfed in flames and smoke that was visible from miles away. The fire was considered mostly contained by 9 a.m. Saturday, but isolated flames still smoldered throughout the day, <a href="https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-ne-yacht-fire-20191117-faaltnhbpba5lcivaiya3lb5o4-story.html">the South Florida Sun Sentinel reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Around 100 firefighters battled the flames by the time the fires were extinguished, according to the Miami Herald. Both fire and foam were used to combat the flames, according to nautical news site <a href="https://www.the-triton.com/2019/11/yachts-lohengrin-and-reflection-burn-at-universal-marine-center-in-fort-lauderdale/">The Triton</a>, including water from the canal sprayed by fireboats.</p>
      <p>Authorities, including the US Environmental Protection Agency, are now monitoring the canal for any contaminants that may have seeped into the water from the yacht, such as diesel.</p>
      <p>Nobody is currently believed to have been injured by the fires and the cause is still being investigated.</p>
