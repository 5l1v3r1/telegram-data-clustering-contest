      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/real-madrid/"><b>Real Madrid</b></a> have allegedly been handed a boost in their efforts to sign <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/psg/"><b>Paris Saint-Germain</b></a> forward <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/kylian-mbappe/"><b>Kylian Mbappe</b></a>.</h2>

      <p>Despite the France international still having over two-and-a-half years remaining on his contract, Real and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/liverpool/"><b>Liverpool</b></a> have each been heavily linked with the 20-year-old.</p>
      <p>PSG are reportedly keen on agreeing fresh terms with Mbappe, despite the possibility of parting ways with the attacker for a world-record fee, something which would dramatically improve their standing with FFP.</p>
      <p>However, according to journalist <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/eduardo-inda/"><b>Eduardo Inda</b></a>, Mbappe's mother and representative has already informed Real that her son will not be extending his stay at Parc des Princes.</p>
      <p>There have been suggestions that Los Blancos may spend up to Â£343m to secure the services of Mbappe, who is known to have an admirer in boss <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/zinedine-zidane/"><b>Zinedine Zidane</b></a>.</p>
      <p>Since leaving Monaco in 2017, Mbappe has scored 69 goals from 90 appearances in all competitions.</p>
