      <p>Paramount Pictures didn’t announce that another <i>Mission: Impossible</i> had been given the green light about half a year after <i>Fallout</i>’s release… it announced that <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2465139/two-new-mission-impossible-movies-are-confirmed-with-a-cool-twist">two new movies were in the works</a>, both of which will be <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2471189/christopher-mcquarrie-admits-hes-freaked-out-about-directing-two-more-mission-impossible-movies">helmed by the returning Christopher McQuarrie</a>. It’s now been revealed one of the folks who will be around for both rides is <i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i> franchise star Pom Klementieff. This casting update comes straight from McQuarrie himself, who posted the following:</p>

      <p>This is the second time that Christopher McQuarrie has taken to social media to make a casting announcement for <i>Mission: Impossible 7</i> and <i>Mission: Impossible 8</i>. Back in September, he revealed that Hayley Atwell, another actress who’s graced the Marvel Cinematic Universe, had been <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2479326/mission-impossible-7-has-recruited-a-marvel-cinematic-universe-star">recruited into the <i>Mission: Impossible</i> franchise</a>, with Atwell clarifying days later that <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2480279/hayley-atwell-confirms-shell-appear-in-both-of-the-next-mission-impossible-movies">she’d be involved in both of the upcoming installments</a>.</p>
      <p>Now we know Pom Klementieff, who’s known best for playing Mantis in the MCU, will also be taking part in <i>Mission: Impossible 7</i> and <i>Mission: Impossible 8</i>, with Christopher McQuarrie teasing her character as a femme fatale in his <a href="https://twitter.com/chrismcquarrie/status/1196843897407909890">Twitter post</a>. That’s not much, but at least it’s something to work with when guessing how she’ll factor into Ethan Hunt’s next adventures. She may initially be enticing to Tom Cruise’s character or at least present herself as an ally, but her ulterior motives will eventually be brought to light.</p>
      <p>Pom Klementieff didn’t waste anytime confirming her involvement in the next <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2464341/christopher-mcquarrie-reveals-how-to-make-a-successful-mission-impossible-movie"><i>Mission: Impossible</i> movies</a> with the following tweet:</p>

      <p>While she wasn’t around for the first <i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i> movie, Pom Klementieff’s Mantis was quickly established as an important character in <i>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2</i>, with Ego the Living Planet, Peter Quill’s father, relying on her empathic abilities to help him sleep while he was in his human form. After Ego was defeated, Mantis joined the Guardians and was present for the events of <i>Avengers: Infinity War</i>, but was dusted during The Decimation. Fortunately, she and everyone else snapped away were brought back to life in <i>Avengers: Endgame</i>.</p>
      <p>Mantis is expected to be back for <i>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</i>, but given that James Gunn is busy working on <i>The Suicide Squad</i>, we still have no idea when the threequel will arrive. Fortunately for Pom Klementieff, she has the opportunity to contribute to another major film franchise as <i>Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3</i> is still being sorted out. Klementieff’s other credits include <i>Ingrid Goes West</i>, <i>Uncut Gems</i>, <i>The Addams Family</i> and the <i>Black Mirror</i> episode “Striking Vipers”.</p>
      <p>Along with Pom Klementieff and Hayley Atwell, the only actors confirmed for <i>Mission: Impossible 7</i> and <i>Mission: Impossible 8</i> are Tom Cruise and Rebecca Ferguson, who are reprising Ethan Hunt and <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2466671/mission-impossible-7-confirms-we-havent-seen-the-last-of-ilsa-faust">Ilsa Faust</a>, respectively. It was rumored shortly after both movies were announced that we <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2465438/the-next-mission-impossible-movies-could-bring-back-two-surprising-characters">might also see Alec Baldwin and Henry Cavill return</a> (almost certainly through flashbacks, since both their characters died in <i>Fallout</i>), but that has yet to be confirmed.</p>
      <p><i>Mission: Impossible 7</i> will be released in theaters on July 23, 2021, and <i>Mission: Impossible 8</i> will follow on August 5, 2022.
