      <p>Officials say an investigation is underway after a passenger died while the Carnival Horizon was returning to port in Miami.</p>
      <p>The Miami-Dade Police Department confirmed a man, who the Miami-Dade County Medical Examiner Department identified as Brian Rice, fell from a balcony to a deck below on the cruise ship Friday and that the ship's medical staff attended to him before he died.</p>
      <p>Rice died from a blunt force trauma injury, Darren J. Caprara, director of operations at the medical examiner's office told USA TODAY, noting Rice's death was not deemed a suicide. </p>
      <p>The ship arrived at PortMiami on Saturday morning, where detectives started a preliminary investigation, Det. Lee Cowart told USA TODAY, noting the investigation is ongoing. </p>
      <p>Carnival spokesman Vance Gulliksen told USA TODAY the cruise line is cooperating with the standard law enforcement investigation. Gulliksen said the line is providing support and that "our thoughts and prayers are with the guest’s family."</p>
      <p>The 3,954-passenger <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/cruises/2018/09/22/carnival-horizon-cruise-ship-debuts-miami/1380487002/">Carnival Horizon debuted in 2018</a> and is tied as Carnival's biggest vessel at 133,500 tons.</p>
      <p>The ship was returning from a six-day, round-trip Western Caribbean cruise, <a href="https://www.cruisemapper.com/ships/Carnival-Horizon-1355">according to CruiseMapper</a>.</p>
