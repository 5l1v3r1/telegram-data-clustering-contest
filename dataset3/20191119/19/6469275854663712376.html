      <p>At around 1.30pm on Saturday, October 6, 2018, a masked man carrying a large kitchen knife entered a convenience store in Manxman Road in Blackburn.</p>
      <p>He threatened the shopkeeper demanding cash but made off empty-handed after the shopkeeper contacted police.</p>
      <p>Following CCTV and telephony enquiries, Hammond was later arrested in Derbyshire.</p>
      <p>Clothing was found which matched those seen on CCTV from the shop.</p>
      <p>He was charged with attempted robbery and possessing an offensive weapon in a public place.</p>
      <p>After pleading guilty to the offences last month, Hammond was sentenced to 20 months in a young offenders’ institute.</p>
      <p>Det Con Alex Summers, of Lancashire Police, said: "Hammond’s behaviour was very threatening and it was only thanks to the quick-thinking actions of the victim, who contacted police, which helped prevent a more serious outcome.</p>
      <p>"The attempted robbery of a shop, very much at the heart of the community, left many residents shocked and appalled.</p>
      <p>"We welcome the sentence handed down at court."</p>
