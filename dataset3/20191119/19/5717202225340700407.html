      <h1>Liverpool fans react as Xherdan Shaqiri resumes training</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:15:38+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/tom-procter/" target="_blank">Tom Procter</a></address>
      <p>Liverpool have received a boost with Xherdan Shaqiri <a href="https://twitter.com/LFC/status/1196843922909204480">finally returning to training</a>.</p>
      <p>The Switzerland international has not featured for the first-team since his three-minute cameo against Napoli in the Champions League in mid-September – the club’s only defeat of the season so far.</p>

      <p>The star has been struggling with a calf injury and has just 25 minutes under his belt in 2019/20 so far.</p>
      <p>The Reds have certainly coped just fine without him though – Jurgen Klopp’s team are currently top of the league by eight points, and are looking good for progression to the knockout stages in Europe.</p>
      <p>They also edged past Arsenal in the Carabao Cup last month, in a game Shaqiri likely would have started had he been fit.</p>
      <p>Shaqiri’s imminent return is timely for Liverpool, with their schedule extremely congested from now until the New Year.</p>

      <p>Klopp is going to have to regularly rotate in order to keep his players as fresh as possible, and Shaqiri can get some much needed minutes.</p>
      <h3>Liverpool fans react</h3>
      <p>Many Liverpool fans were delighted to see the 27-year-old back with his teammates after his recent struggles:</p>
