      <p>Why did a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/science/wild-nature/mammals">camel</a>, a cow and a donkey cross the road?</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime/police-and-law-enforcement">Police</a> in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/us-regions/midwest/kansas">Kansas</a> were left wondering just that after they discovered the unlikely animal trio roaming together on Sunday in Goddard, about 15 miles west of Wichita, in a scene they found reminiscent of a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/special/occasions/christmas">Christmas</a> Nativity.</p>

      <p>“Does anyone know the owners of these three friends traveling together (towards a Northern star) just East of Goddard,” the department <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GoddardPoliceDepartment/photos/a.1532067436832650/2659808440725205/?type=3&amp;__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARC6bh3zXs3l_ZPcIxcdC1fPaWfJI86Ho9wGPwu4gXhnzoBFNu3AOUyPhp8GmsVv_3ZRgzr-DMZGAIzjYEsewqGzSlNNDeMjMuz49qpizG3jAUXiOOF3LpZOpyx3zQ34d7WunKiZuy8ix2_vEElB4tWbqRYx2h0VcrmcP7bjP2u24u5mjYAA9y2cecR0jyS2c4stqDXS8Hs5Eh9EeI1IrmSc72cJiiyDcHoYEeHc3p7gLtiYs3RKDaFAW7_cWuP0sUo92QzjtQ1UIMX7KF4K_4H1GrBbG8iDRwCHowm_CP3n9l0__sLtdOIiquJH6cV2JWOt6lYr-ZcGfhAc4pVh9vAXxw&amp;__tn__=-R">wrote</a>. “If we cannot locate the owner, we may be halfway towards a live nativity this Christmas season.”</p>
      <p>The Goddard Police Department posted a photo on Facebook that showed the animals proceeding toward a golden light, playing into the seasonal theme.</p>

        <figcaption>Police had a sense of humor about the odd situation, writing on social media that if they couldn't find the owner, "we may be halfway towards a live nativity this Christmas season.”  (Devon Keith/Goddard Police Department)</figcaption>

      <p>Police updated their post a short time later, confirming they had found the animals' owner. Sedgwick County Sheriff’s Lt. Tim Meyers said the animals belonged to an employee of the nearby Tanganyika Wildlife Park.</p>
      <p>But not before the photo set off a string of jokes – some of biblical proportions – on social media.</p>

      <p>One person who replied to the Facebook post asked, “Are there 3 wise looking men near?” Another <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GoddardPoliceDepartment/posts/2659811690724880?comment_id=2659886064050776">speculated</a> that they “may lead you to the Second Coming.”</p>
      <p>Several were interested in their names, asking: “Are there (sic) names gold, frankincense and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GoddardPoliceDepartment/posts/2659811690724880?comment_id=2661475097225206">myrrh</a>?”</p>
      <p>“They are looking for the nativity scene, they are stars,” another <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GoddardPoliceDepartment/posts/2659811690724880?comment_id=2661716590534390">wrote</a>.</p>
      <p>Others were just confused over the appearance of the animals in the Midwestern state, with one flabberghasted user writing: “Who owns a CAMEL in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/GoddardPoliceDepartment/posts/2659811690724880?comment_id=2660067697365946">Kansas</a>?”</p>

      <p>It wasn’t immediately clear how the fugitive animals managed to escape the park.</p>
