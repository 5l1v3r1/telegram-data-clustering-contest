      <p>Based on its online search results, the <a href="https://static.lystit.com/static/n/year_in_fashion_2019/pdf/en/YIF_DownloadPDF_V3.102b9b5d8b28.pdf">newly-released Year in Fashion report </a>found former “Suits” actress turned royal Meghan Markle is the platform’s number one “power dressers.”</p>
      <p>The shopping site collected search data from 104 million online shoppers and its <a href="https://www.lyst.co.uk/year-in-fashion-2019/">report broke down the rankings </a>based on “whose personal style choices drove the biggest spikes in searches, sales, news coverage and social media mentions over the last 12 months.”</p>
      <p>Lyst found that, on average, Meghan’s choices led to a 216 per cent increase in searches for those dresses or similar outfits.</p>
      <p>Some of Markle’s most iconic dresses include her white Givenchy gown during her wedding, her J. Crew denim shirt dress she wore at the 2019 U.S. Open and the navy Givenchy dress she donned for Queen Elizabeth’s 93rd birthday celebrations.</p>

      <p>It’s also not uncommon to see the Duchess of Sussex <a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1069719/how-meghan-markle-has-changed-royal-family-fashion">rocking a bun, wearing slacks, and opting for dark-coloured clothing </a>instead of the brighter, flashier outfits worn by either her sister-in-law, the Duchess of Cambridge, or the Queen.</p>

        <b>THE NOTICABLE 'MEGHAN SPARKLE'</b>
      </p>
      <p>Meghan’s impact on fashion brands is not a shocker, considering that the term “Meghan Sparkle” was coined for her power to improve sales simply by wearing a brand’s dress.</p>
      <p>For example, during her trip with her husband Prince Harry, the style of shirt dresses that the Duchess wore spiked by 45 per cent month-over-month.</p>
      <p>In fact, the report stated her “Club Monaco dress sold out in less than 24 hours, following a 570 per cent spike in searches and wearing a J Crew skirt saw a 102 per cent increase in searches for the brand."</p>
