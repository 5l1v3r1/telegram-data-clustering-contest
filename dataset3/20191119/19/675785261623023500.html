      <h1>Mauricio Pochettino sacked by Tottenham Hotspur after disappointing start to season</h1>
      <h2>Mauricio Pochettino has left Tottenham Hotspur, having led the club to the Champions League final last season, after struggling so far this term</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:40:39+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:40</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Richards, https://www.facebook.com/AARichards/</a></address>
      <p>Mauricio Pochettino's <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham Hotspur</a> five-year reign is no more after he was sacked by Spurs on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>A club statement declared that the Argentine, along with his coaching staff of Jesus Perez, Miguel D’Agostino and Antoni Jimenez, have been relieved of their duties.</p>
      <p>Just over five months ago, Pochettino was on the brink of Champions League glory following Spurs' remarkable run to the final, the culmination of a season in which he was also heavily linked with the jobs at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a>.</p>
      <p>But after defeat to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> in Madrid, Spurs have endured a wretched start to the current campaign.</p>
      <p>Spurs have won just three league games so far this season and only six of their last 24. Pochettino has cut a frustrated figure for much of the current season.</p>

      <p>Of the 14 Premier League sides to spend the entirety of 2019 in the top flight, no side suffered more than the 18 defeats managed by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> and since summer, he has cut a frustrated figure</p>
      <p>Chairman, Daniel Levy, said: "We were extremely reluctant to make this change and it is not a decision the Board has taken lightly, nor in haste.</p>
      <p>“Regrettably domestic results at the end of last season and beginning of this season have been extremely disappointing.</p>
      <p>“It falls to the Board to make the difficult decisions - this one made more so given the many memorable moments we have had with Mauricio and his coaching staff - but we do so in the Club's best interests.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>“Mauricio and his coaching staff will always be part of our history. I have the utmost admiration for the manner in which he dealt with the difficult times away from a home ground whilst we built the new stadium and for the warmth and positivity he brought to us.</p>
      <p>"I should like to thank him and his coaching staff for all they have contributed. They will always be welcome here.</p>
      <p>“We have a talented squad. We need to re-energise and look to deliver a positive season for our supporters.” </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Levy has had to pay big money to part with Pochettino and his staff, all of whom signed new five-year contracts in May 2018.</p>
      <p>That number could be as much as the £19.6million that Manchester United paid to dismiss Jose Mourinho and his staff in December 2018.</p>
      <p>Pochettino was at the helm for 293 games and delivered four successive top-four Premier League finishes, challenging for the title in 2015/16 and 2016/17.</p>
      <p>Pochettino will have no shortage of suitors when he decides to return to the game.</p>
      <p>As well as having long-term admirers in the shape of United and Real Madrid, he is also admired by Bayern Munich chiefs, with the Bavarians currently without a manager following the exit of Niko Kovac.</p>
