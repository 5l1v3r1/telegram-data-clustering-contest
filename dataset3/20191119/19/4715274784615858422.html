      <p>US-based AQ Skin Solutions supports skin rejuvenation through its patented Growth Factors (GF) technology. </p>
      <p>The cutting-edge growth factor technology was originally discovered through wound healing and cell regeneration therapy in third-degree burn victims. Wounds that can be healed by GF technology include the overt ones (as in surgical incisions) and cellular level ones (such as those from non-invasive laser, radio-frequency, and ultrasound treatments). </p>
      <p>Consistent medical research has proven that when formulated correctly, patented GF-technology holds the potential to reverse the cell aging process, fade scars, and boost the body’s natural repair process regarding skin, hair follicles, and vaginal walls. </p>
      <p>Dr. Ahmed Al-Qahtani, a multi-awarded immunologist and scientist, and founder and president of AQ Skin Solutions—one of the only two companies in the world that have been granted a patent for GF—is the inventor of the technology of extracting human growth factors from the fibroblast of a skin cell to create the anti-aging serums. </p>
      <p>Dr. Al-Qahtani was in Manila to personally launch AQ Skin Solutions, brought to the country by Dr. Cenia Lucas-Acevedo, founder of Vivacité Center for Scientific Wellness. </p>
      <p>Dr. Lucas-Acevedo, a Health Optimization Medicine practitioner, was inspired to bring the brand over to the Philippines after observing how most of the current skincare treatments are invasive. </p>
      <p>“So many skincare procedures and treatments promise to be the fountain of youth. But majority of them are invasive, can be painful, and not sustainable. Cosmetic procedures like threads and fillers, for example, ironically ages the skin in the long-term and merely pulls and pushes the face without really addressing the health of the skin itself. As it is, plumping the skin with a foreign element is actually stressful to our skin cells,” revealed Dr. Lucas-Acevedo.</p>
      <p>She explained further, “AQ Skin Solutions supports the body’s own ability to regenerate and achieve better-looking skin and to grow hair. It helps address the health of the skin itself. It is a modality that assists our body’s innate capacity to heal or correct an imbalance. Not to force the body to an unnatural state.”</p>
      <p>AQ Skin Solutions has four products approved by FDA Philippines: AQ Active Serum, AQ Eye Serum, AQ Recovery Serum, and AQ Advanced Hair Complex+. All four have specific growth factors that respond to user’s specific needs. </p>
      <p>The Active Serum, a daily topical system, is designed to promote rejuvenation by helping decrease fine lines and wrinkles. The Eye Serum, on the other hand, helps reduce the appearance of “crow’s feet,” wrinkles, and fine lines around the eyes. </p>
      <p>Containing the highest concentration of natural growth factors, proteoglycan, and glycosaminoglycans, the AQ Recovery Serum is popular among medical doctors as it enhances the effects of aesthetic procedures. </p>
      <p>Finally, the AQ Advanced Hair Complex+ addresses aging hair follicles and hair loss by employing patented growth factor technology. </p>
