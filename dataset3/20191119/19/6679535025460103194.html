      <h1>Octogenarian gets second doctorate</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:33:32+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Pon-Vasanth-B-A-42735/" target="_blank">Pon Vasanth B. A.</a></address>
      <p>It has been two decades since 84-year-old T.D. Krishnamachari retired from his job. However, retirement did not mean an end to his intellectual quest. It was after his retirement that he has obtained two post-graduate degrees, two PhDs and a post-graduate diploma.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, at the 162nd convocation of University of Madras, he received his second PhD for his research on ‘Space, rituals and communication practices of Nagarathar community’ from the university’s Department of Journalism and Communication under supervision of Professor G. Ravindran.</p>
      <p>Mr. Krishnamachari, a postgraduate in mathematics, worked in the private sector and in the Indian Institute of Management - Ahmedabad in a career spanning four decades before retiring in 1998. After retirement, his interest in Sanskrit had him complete an M.A in Sanskrit.</p>
      <p>“It was my son’s questioning of my knowledge in Vaishanivism that subsequently led me to finish a Masters in Vaishanvism,” he said. This was followed by a PhD in Sanskrit based on his research of some of the works of Vedanta Desika.</p>
      <p>He later enrolled for a full-time Masters programme in Journalism and Communication in University of Madras. “My daughter-in-law suggested this to me since journalism covers a wide-range of subjects. I stood first in the university,” he said. On his future plans, Mr. Krishnamachari said that he wanted to return to mathematics. “The pursuit of knowledge has become a second nature. I cannot stop. I have now approached the Institute of Mathematical Sciences to see if I can pursue a course there,” he said.</p>
