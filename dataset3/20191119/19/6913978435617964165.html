      <p><b>LONDON — </b>A British university on Tuesday said it was reviewing its links with Prince Andrew after he defended his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein in a TV interview.<br/><br/>But a bank said it would not be renewing its backing for a project he founded.<br/><br/>"We will be reviewing the position of Prince Andrew, Duke of York, as our patron at the next board of governors meeting on Tuesday 26th November," said London Metropolitan University.<br/><br/>"The university opposes all forms of discrimination of discrimination, abuse, human trafficking and any activity that is contrary to the university's values."<br/><br/>Andrew — Queen Elizabeth II's second son — took over the role from his father, Prince Philip, in 2013. There have been royal patrons at the institution since 1848.<br/><br/>The review comes after the BBC broadcast a lengthy interview with the prince on Saturday in which he tried to explain his links to Epstein, who was found dead in jail in August.<br/><br/>Andrew strongly denied claims he had had sex with a 17-year-old girl allegedly trafficked by Epstein but expressed little regret about his friendship with the disgraced financier.<br/><br/>The unprecedented subject matter tackled in the television interview — and the royal's apparent lack of empathy for victims — has dominated British media in recent days.<br/><br/>It has also put pressure on those with links to the prince.<br/><br/>Students at Huddersfield University in northern England said they wanted Andrew to resign as a patron, claiming he was "an utterly unsuitable representative" because of the allegations.<br/><br/>Standard Chartered bank meanwhile said it was not renewing its sponsorship of the prince's Pitch@Palace project, which encourages entrepreneurs and start-ups around the world.<br/><br/>The bank cited "commercial reasons" for not renewing the current agreement when it expires in December.<br/><br/>Accountancy firm KPMG's backing for the mentoring scheme expired at the end of last month and will not be renewed.<br/><br/>Pharma giant AstraZeneca's partnership is due up next month. It is also being reviewed.<br/><br/>Insurance giant AON reportedly asked for its logo to be removed from the Pitch@Palace website, according to the Financial Times. — AFP</p>
