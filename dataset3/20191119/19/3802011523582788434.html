      <p>The 38-year-old has been jailed for 33 years after fleeing the home, leaving Ms Al-Charabi to die alone.</p>
      <p>Her body was discovered on November 17 by another carer.</p>
      <p>Msipha was arrested walking away from the address with a suitcase and taken to a North London police station.</p>
      <p>Police discovered Msipha had a fake identity document and was in the country illegally, which may have caused her reluctance to call for help.</p>
      <p>Msipha was sentenced on Monday to a total of 33 months imprisonment following a hearing at the Old Bailey.</p>
      <p>She previously pleaded guilty to wilful neglect causing death, for which she received 27 months in prison, and fraud, for which she received a six-month sentence.</p>
      <p>Ms Al-Charabi’s son Khaldoun Zeitouni explained how he found her ‘naked and broken on the cold tiled floor of her bedroom’.</p>
      <p>He described his mother as a ‘gentle and kind lady’ who had always been ‘chatty, caring and very loving’ towards her entire family.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘She was so generous with her time and emotional support. She was everything to me: my best friend, the person I would go to, often my companion, and my mum.</p>
      <p>‘What makes it even worse is the thought of how she died. I have so many unanswered questions as to what happened, the extent of her injuries, whether she was in any pain, how long it had taken for her to pass away and was she calling out for me or for help?’</p>
      <p>Detective inspector James Howarth, said: ‘Sibusisiwe Msipha should have had the care of a vulnerable 89-year-old lady as her top priority. She failed in that duty.</p>
      <p>‘Msipha inexcusably abandoned Mrs Hind Al-Charabi to pass away on her own and showed a total disregard for the safety and security of a fellow human being.</p>
      <p>‘Mrs Al-Charabi’s family have suffered intolerably and whilst no sentence can ever make up for the loss of a loved one, we are pleased that justice has been served today.’</p>
