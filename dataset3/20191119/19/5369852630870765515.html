      <p>TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR HAVE announced that Mauricio Pochettino has left the Premier League club.</p>
      <p>“The Club can today announce that Mauricio Pochettino and his coaching staff Jesus Perez, Miguel D’Agostino and Antoni Jimenez have been relieved of their duties,”<a href="https://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/2019/november/mauricio-leaves-club/"> a statement reads.</a></p>
      <p>The Argentine — who has recently been heavily linked with Manchester United and Real Madrid — was appointed head coach of Spurs in 2014 following a stint at Southampton.</p>
      <p>He guided the London club to new heights — recording four consecutive top-four Premier League finishes, one of those a second-place conclusion in 2016/17.</p>
      <p>Last season, Pochettino led them to the Champions League final for the first time in the club’s history. But Spurs have endured a terrible start to the 2019/20 season, winning just three league games so far — and six of their last 24.</p>
      <p>“We were extremely reluctant to make this change and it is not a decision the Board has taken lightly, nor in haste,” chairman Daniel Levy said.</p>
      <p>“Regrettably domestic results at the end of last season and beginning of this season have been extremely disappointing.</p>

      <p>“It falls to the Board to make the difficult decisions – this one made more so given the many memorable moments we have had with Mauricio and his coaching staff – but we do so in the Club’s best interests.</p>
      <blockquote>Mauricio and his coaching staff will always be part of our history. I have the utmost admiration for the manner in which he dealt with the difficult times away from a home ground whilst we built the new stadium and for the warmth and positivity he brought to us. I should like to thank him and his coaching staff for all they have contributed. They will always be welcome here.</blockquote>
      <p>“We have a talented squad. We need to re-energise and look to deliver a positive season for our supporters.”</p>
