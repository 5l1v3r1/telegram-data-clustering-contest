      <p>Nov. 19 (UPI) -- A Georgia sheriff's deputy's body camera was recording when he came to the rescue of a small deer that had become stuck between the bars of a fence.</p>
      <p>The Forsyth County Sheriff's Office posted a video <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2441053086137859">to Facebook</a> showing the deer trapped in the fence after apparently trying to squeeze through a narrow opening.</p>
      <p>The video shows the deputy waiting for the deer to tire itself out and stop struggling before wiggling the animal free of its predicament.</p>
      <p>"There he goes," the deputy says as the deer wanders off, "Bambi's free."</p>
