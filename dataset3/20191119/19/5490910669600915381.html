      <p>“You look amazing,” a refined, older gentleman said to his date Monday evening from inside Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center.</p>
      <p>“Only because of Lauder do I look this way,” she retorted.</p>
      <p>The Lauder love was in strong showing for the annual Lincoln Center Corporate Fund gala, this year honoring <a href="https://wwd.com/tag/leonard-lauder/">Leonard Lauder</a>.</p>
      <p>Now in its seventh year, the evening drew Estée Lauder faces like Elizabeth Hurley, Carolyn Murphy, Karlie Kloss and Hilary Rhoda, as well as much of the extended Lauder family.</p>
      <p>Hurley and the evening’s moderator, Tom Ford, were escorted to a private room promptly upon arrival. Brooke Shields gingerly navigated the staircase down to the red carpet, in a tight navy velvet dress. Inside she made her way about, greeting the Lauders one by one.</p>
      <p>James Turlington, quickly becoming one of the New York party circuit’s most ubiquitous faces, caught the attention of the cameras alongside a friend.</p>
      <p>“He’s the star,” the friend said, ducking out of the way.</p>
      <p>Candace Bushnell was in good spirits, and said her secret to navigating the chaos of the holiday social season was to simply enjoy it.</p>
      <p>“I’m actually excited about it. It’s the one time of year to go out,” she said. “I just bought something that has some green in it. So yes, I am into festive dressing. I have some things lined up.”</p>
      <p>Inside the theater, Lauder was welcomed by onstage appearances by Hurley, Tommy Hilfiger, Glenda Bailey and Hearst’s Steven Swartz.</p>
      <p>Hurley told the crowd of the first time she met Lauder: when, at 29 years old, she was asked to come to New York to audition to be the new face of Estée Lauder. It would be her first modeling job.</p>
      <p>“When I saw you, I could see at once that you had three qualities that I admired more than any other: I could see that you are wise, you are honest, and you are kind,” she said. “You are quite simply cut from a cloth that has long been discontinued.”</p>
      <p>Prior to a performance by Jennifer Hudson (who squeezed in a shout-out promo for her upcoming role in “Cats,” in addition to singing a trio of songs), Lauder and Ford sat in conversation, ranging from lessons he learned from Estée (“Yes mother”), why he thinks a decision should never be made without a woman at the table (“A woman will always tell you what’s on her mind, not what you want to hear”), the importance of a “little blue note” and why he believes in the power of print: “does digital have content? Hardly. Do magazines have content? Yes.”</p>
