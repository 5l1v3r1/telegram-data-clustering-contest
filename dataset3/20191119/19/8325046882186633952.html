      <p>Oracle is considering naming a president who could be groomed to take the place of Mark Hurd, the tech giant’s co-CEO who died last month, according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-19/oracle-delays-decision-to-replace-mark-hurd">Bloomberg</a> report.</p>
      <p>Oracle had indicated that it was planning to name a new co-CEO to Safra Catz, but the software behemoth is now likely to appoint a president first to give that executive time to grow into the CEO role, the report said, citing unnamed sources.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Oracle declined to comment.</p>
      <p>Hurd died last month, leaving Catz as Oracle’s sole CEO. Founder and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/larry-ellison-oracle-board-candidates-next-ceo-2019-9">Chairman Larry Ellison</a> had said that the company plans to maintain its dual CEO leadership structure and he was planning to present five internal candidates to the Oracle board.</p>
      <p>Ellison publicly mentioned two potential candidates – Steve Miranda, the company’s cloud applications chief, and Don Johnson, who leads Oracle’s cloud infrastructure business. Sources also mentioned <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/5-executives-larry-ellison-insiders-next-oracle-ceo-2019-10#steve-miranda-leads-oracles-cloud-applications-development-1">three other possible candidates</a> to Business Insider’s Julie Bort.</p>
      <p>The leadership is taking place at a time when Oracle is trying to strengthen its <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/oracle-sap-change-new-ceos-cloud-larry-ellison-2019-10">position in the cloud</a> where it is competing with rivals led by Amazon, Microsoft and Google.</p>
