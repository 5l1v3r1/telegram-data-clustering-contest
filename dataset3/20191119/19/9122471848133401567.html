      <h1>Carmelo Anthony Reveals Why He’s Wearing No. 00</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T19:08:14+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 19:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/danlyons" target="_blank">Dan Lyons</a></address>
      <p>For the first time in over a year, Carmelo Anthony will play in an NBA game. The former Denver Nuggets and New York Knicks star <a href="https://thespun.com/nba/report-carmelo-anthony-is-reportedly-signing-with-a-new-nba-team">signed with the Portland Trail Blazers</a>, who are looking to turn things around after a disappointing 5-9 start.</p>
      <p>His new basketball opportunity comes with a new number, as well. Anthony famously wore No. 15 in Denver and No. 7 in New York, as well as his brief stints with the Oklahoma City Thunder and Houston Rockets.</p>
      <p>In Portland, he’s donning No. 00, and you better believe that he has a very specific explanation for the choice.</p>

      <p>From Anthony’s post about the new number:</p>
      <blockquote>“-A number greater than any assignable quantity or countable number (symbol ∞).<br/>-Without end<br/>-Process that never stops<br/>-Can never B given an exact value<br/>-Simplicity and balance<br/>-The mysticism of our past and the possibility for an eternal future give the infinity symbol a sense of awe and wonder.<br/>-Infinite nature of (God)7<br/>-We cannot stay away from God without him trying to bring us back to him<br/>-The chance to have a new and great beginning with the past left behind where it belongs<br/>-Beginnings or end<br/>-Alpha &amp; Omega”</blockquote>
      <p>So that is all obviously a lot, but basically, Carmelo Anthony is going for some sort of infinity motif. If he can help Portland, which reached the Western Conference Finals in 2018-19, get back to its winning ways, there’ll be plenty of ’00’ jerseys solid in the Pacific Northwest.</p>
      <p>Whatever happens, it is good that a future Hall of Famer is getting another shot to finish his career on his own terms, even if it didn’t come exactly in the way that most would have expected a few years ago.</p>
      <p>Melo and the Blazers are in New Orleans tonight, for an 8 p.m. ET game against the Pelicans.</p>
