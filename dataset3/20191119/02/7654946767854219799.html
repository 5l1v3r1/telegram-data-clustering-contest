      <p>Video footage captured the moment Texas police officers burst through a hotel room door and rescue a kidnapped 8-year-old girl hiding in a basket of laundry.</p>
      <p>The body camera footage released by police shows cops in Fort Worth bang on the door and demand the kidnapper raise his hands when they enter the room.</p>
      <p>Once they have the suspect in handcuffs, cops then locate the kidnapped girl, who was in a basket.</p>
      <p>“Got her, we got her, we got her,” one of the officer’s yells, according to the video.</p>
      <p>The dramatic scene capped a frantic search by police. The 8-year-old who was snatched off a street while walking with her mother on May 18, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/body-cam-footage-shows-dramatic-rescue-kidnapped-girl-n1085226">NBC News reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Authorities circulated an image of the suspect’s car and a tipster eventually called 911 when he saw the vehicle in the parking lot of the hotel in suburban Fort Worth, according to the report.</p>
      <p>The kidnapper, Michael Webb, was busted for kidnapping and convicted in September.</p>
      <p>He was sentenced to life in prison last week.</p>
