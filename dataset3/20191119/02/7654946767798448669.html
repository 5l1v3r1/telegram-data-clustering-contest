      <h1>Knicks deliver loud message in Cavaliers revenge</h1>

      <p>This game will surely leave Knicks president Steve Mills silent.</p>
      <p>One week after <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/10/knicks-brass-publicizes-frustrations-in-wild-news-conference/">The Mills Press Conference Game against the Cavaliers</a>, the Knicks went from the outhouse to the penthouse against Cleveland as Julius Randle broke out for a season-high 30 points in a 123-105 rout Monday at the Garden.</p>
      <p>Randle scored 23 of his points in the first half — banging in shots from the 3-point line and driving easily to the hoop against the defenseless Cavaliers, who were missing top forwards Kevin Love and Larry Nance. Randle wound up shooting 12 of 17 — 3 of 5 on 3-pointers.</p>
      <p>Last Sunday, Mills and GM Scott Perry stunned the NBA by staging a press conference to express dissatisfaction with the team’s direction and put coach David Fizdale on notice after the Knicks were throttled by Cleveland in a 21-point loss.</p>
      <p>“It’s fresh in our minds at least and we can go right back to that film and suffer again,’’ Fizdale said of the prior loss to Cleveland. “Hopefully, come out and play a better basketball game.</p>
      <p>The Knicks moved to 2-2 since Mills’ declaration, which was the idea of owner James Dolan, who had to enjoy Monday’s easy ride as the Knicks went up 12 points in the first quarter. The Knicks would be on a three-game winning streak if not for Charlotte’s Devonte’ Graham’s last-second 3-pointer Saturday.</p>
      <p>The Knicks instead moved to 4-10 with the 8-5 Sixers on tap Wednesday in Philadelphia.</p>
      <p>Marcus Morris added 23 points, rookie RJ Barrett put up 15 and Frank Ntilikina finished with six points and six assists.</p>
      <p>Randle had been under fire recently for his up-and-down play and missed with an airball on a final-second shot against Charlotte. He told The Post he’s not feeling the heat.</p>
      <p>“I don’t feel pressure, man,’’ Randle said. “I don’t believe in that stuff. It’s basketball. If I’m doing it to the best of my ability, it’s enough. Pressure is raising my son [Kyden]. That’s true pressure. That’s more of a task than this.”</p>
