      </p>
      <p>In the course of trying to be fanciful with language, some of us unknowingly break rules. Perhaps some even do so intentionally.  Interestingly, as we have in law, ignorance is not an excuse in grammar.</p>
      <p>Consider the way some folk use the term, ‘alot’. Perhaps thinking that it is trendier than ‘a lot’, they inject  the fake word into their texts and move on. One of our reigning reality stars particularly gave me cause to bring the matter to this class today. In a story she posted on social media a few days ago, she noted, “Without any sort of confirmation alot of people have called me unprintable names and some bloggers have fed off the matter and written so many lies about me.”</p>
      <p>Based on what is seen here, ‘alot’ and ‘a lot’ are, to her, the same thing. No, they are not.</p>
      <p>Meaning a large quantity or number, ‘a lot’ comes as two words that are neither abbreviated – like ‘aren’t – nor joined. So, note that ‘alot’ is an unacceptable expression:</p>
      <p>I have alot of things to tell you. (Wrong)</p>
      <p>I have a lot of things to tell you. (Correct)</p>
      <p>Alot of guys went there because of the babes. (Wrong)</p>
      <p>A lot of guys went there because of the babes. (Correct)</p>
      <p>
        <b>Inspite</b>
      </p>
      <p>Another phrase to watch is ‘in spite’, which also comes as  two words. Because the other word for it (despite) is a single term, a lot of users erroneously merge ‘in’ and ‘spite’ too:</p>
      <p>Inspite of his claims, the bank manager said he could not withdraw from the account. (Wrong)</p>
      <p>In spite of his claims, the bank manager said he could not withdraw from the account. (Correct)</p>
      <p>Liverpool won the game inspite of Salah’s injury. (Wrong)</p>
      <p>Liverpool won the match in spite of Salah’s injury.</p>
      <p>Despite the fact that she studied Engineering, he wants to work in the accounts department. (Correct)</p>
      <p> <b>Atimes</b></p>
      <p>This is another trendy error, used by people who think ‘at times’ can be so illegally wedded. The expression, ‘at times’, meaning occasionally, sporadically or infrequently, are two separate words. It thus means that you cannot replace it with ‘atimes’. Perhaps those guilty of writing it so consider the way the phrase sounds when we are speaking, with little or no border between the words and with the t’s nearly melting. The fact, however, is that the written and spoken language are not always the same:</p>
      <p>We met atimes when we were in Canada. (Wrong)</p>
      <p>We met at times when we were in Canada. (Correct)</p>
      <p>Atimes the man gets moody. (Wrong)</p>
      <p>At times the man gets moody. (Correct)</p>
      <p>Similarly, remember that the correct expression is ‘in recent times’, not ‘in recent time’. Of course, you should also not mix up in recent times with recently. They could be synonyms but they are favoured by different structures:</p>
      <p>In recent time, some world powers have been experiencing turmoil. (Wrong)</p>
      <p>In recent times, some world powers have been experiencing turmoil. (Correct)</p>
      <p>I saw him in recent times. (Wrong)</p>
      <p>I saw him recently. (Correct)</p>
      <p>I have been going to him in recent times. (Correct)</p>
      <p>
        <b>Many a what?</b>
      </p>
      <p>As we once discussed in this class, the right verb for ‘Many a man/ Many a time’ is the singular, not plural. Of course, the expression itself is Many a man/Many a time not Many a men or Many a times:</p>
      <p>Many a man like to control their wives. (Wrong)</p>
      <p>Many a man likes to control his wife. (Correct)</p>
      <p>Many a Nigerian politician are not patriotic. (Wrong)</p>
      <p>Many a Nigerian politician is not patriotic. (Correct)</p>
