      <h1>Tokyo shares retreat as firmer yen weighs on exporters</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T02:13:47+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 02:13</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>TOKYO — Japan’s stock benchmark Nikkei edged down on Tuesday as investors await clarity on the progress of U.S-China trade negotiations, with exporters pressured by a firmer yen against the dollar.</p>
      <p>The Nikkei share average dropped 0.2% to 23,361.35 in late-morning trade, and the broader Topix fell 0.1% at 1,698.44.</p>
      <p>Wall Street’s main indexes were mostly flat, looking for direction on trade, though they ended the day inching up to record high closing levels.</p>
      <p>Overnight, CNBC reported the mood in Beijing was pessimistic about the prospects of sealing a phase-one deal with Washington.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, a new extension allowing U.S. companies to continue doing business with Chinese telecoms giant Huawei Technologies Co Ltd suggested something of an olive branch.</p>
      <p>The Japanese yen firmed as much as 0.2% to 108.47 versus the dollar early on Tuesday, weighing on exporters as a strong local currency hurts corporate profits when they are repatriated.</p>
      <p>Export-oriented Fanuc Corp shed 1.0%, while Toyota Motor Corp fell 0.7% and Sony Corp shed 1.3%.</p>
      <p>Semiconductor-related shares retreated as some profit-taking selling kicked in, with SUMCO Corp shedding 2.3% and Disco Corp falling 0.5%.</p>
      <p>The Nikkei’s heavyweight SoftBank Group Corp fell 1.4% after Reuters reported that the New York State Attorney General is investigating WeWork, citing sources. SoftBank Group is the majority owner of the office-sharing startup.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Mitsubishi Chemical Holdings Corp dived 3.5% after Japan’s largest chemical maker said it will pay 491.8 billion yen ($4.5 billion) to make Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corp a fully-owned subsidiary. Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma shares were untraded amid heavy buy orders. (Reporting by Tomo Uetake; Editing by Stephen Coates)</p>
