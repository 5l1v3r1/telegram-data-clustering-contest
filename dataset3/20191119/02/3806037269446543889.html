      <h1>Kanye West &amp; Dr. Dre Reveal 'Jesus Is King Part II' Is "Coming Soon"</h1>
      <h2>Taking to Twitter to share a picture of the two in Dre’s studio.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T02:03:06+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 02:03</time> by <a rel="author">Torsten Ingvaldsen</a></address>
      <p>Following the release of <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/kanye-west">Kanye West’</a>s Christian-centric album <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/jesus-is-king"><i>Jesus Is King</i></a>, the music and clothing magnate has now shared that he and Dr. Dre are working on <i>Jesus Is King Part II</i>. Taking to Twitter earlier today, Ye shared a picture of him and Dre in Dr. Dre’s studio with an accompanying caption saying “Ye and Dre Jesus is King Part II coming soon.”</p>
      <p>The news comes off the heels of West’s recently announced <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/kanye-west-nebuchadnezzar-opera-announcement"><i>Nebuchadnezzar</i></a> opera as well as a recent performance at <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/kanye-west-sunday-service-joel-osteen-lakewood-church">televangelist Joel Osteen’s Lakewood church</a>. His debut gospel album, <i>Jesus Is King</i>, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/kanye-west-jesus-is-king-debut-number-1-billboard-200">debuted at No.1 one on the Billboard 200 charts</a>, equally being garnering No. 1 on the Top Christian and Top Gospel Album charts, making it the biggest unit week on the chart since adapting to a multi-metric methodology back in February 2017.</p>
      <p>The history between Dr. Dre and Kanye is nothing new within the world of hip-hop. Dre had been credited as being one of Kanye’s <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/100-greatest-artists-147446/dr-dre-6-88124/">biggest inspirations</a> following his first hearing of Eazy-E’s <i>Eazy-Duz-It</i> back in 1988 when Ye was just 11 years old. They later went on to meet in 2003, first working together on a project with The Game’s <i>The Documentary</i> in 2005, and later on JAY-Z’s <i>Kingdom Come</i> in 2006. Most recently, Swizz Beatz <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BC_0hgCyDMD/?utm_source=ig_embed">confirmed</a> in 2016 that DMX was working with both artists for his new project.</p>
