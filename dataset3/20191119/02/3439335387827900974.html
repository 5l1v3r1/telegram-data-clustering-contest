      <p>The Hawaii women’s volleyball team remained at No. 18 in today’s American Volleyball Coaches Association Top 25 while dropping one place to 12 in today’s Ratings Percentage Index, the computer-generated computer system used by the NCAA to rate strength of schedule and seed the postseason tournament.</p>
      <p>The Rainbow Wahine (22-3, 12-2 Big West) are coming off a bye week and conclude the regular season with conference matches against Cal State Northridge (12-15, 7-8) on Thursday and Long Beach State (12-15, 9-6) on Friday at the Stan Sheriff Center.</p>
      <p>Should Hawaii win out, the Wahine will claim the Big West title outright, their first since 2016. Cal Poly, Hawaii’s closest competitor in the standings, lost to Long Beach State last week, dropping the Mustangs (18-8, 11-3) a full game behind the Wahine.</p>
      <p>The NCAA traditionally has awarded teams with an RPI of 1 to 16 hosting duties for the first and second rounds of the tournament. Hawaii has not hosted a subregional since 2013.</p>
      <p>Selection Sunday is Dec. 1.</p>
      <p>In today’s poll, the top four remained the same led by Texas (19-2, 51 first-place votes). No. 2 Pitt (26-1) received 11 votes, No. 3 Baylor (21-1) one vote and No. 4 Stanford (20-4) one vote.</p>
      <p>Hawaii is 4-1 against teams mentioned in the poll. The Wahine lost to Baylor but have wins over No. 10 Washington and No. 20 San Diego, as well as wins over UCLA — the Bruins outside the Top 25 at 27th with 48 points — and Missouri — the Tigers at 29th with 34 points.</p>
      <p>Baylor has been at 1 in the RPI since the first rating was released Oct. 7. The RPI is based on a team’s won-loss record, the record of its opponents and the record of its opponents’ opponents. There is a bonus for defeating teams in the Top 50.</p>
      <p>Hawaii has victories over Washington (RPI 10), Missouri (18), UCLA (23), San Diego (26) and Cal Poly (36), and two over UC Santa Barbara (33).</p>
