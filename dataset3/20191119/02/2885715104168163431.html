      <h1>Frozen 2 writer-director Jennifer Lee: Challenges were greater with the sequel</h1>
      <h2>Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck directorial Frozen 2 releases in India on November 22.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T02:30:52+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 02:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/a-kameshwari/" target="_blank">A. Kameshwari</a></address>
      <p>Frozen 2 director duo Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck along with producer Peter Del Vecho talk to <a href="https://indianexpress.com/">indianexpress.com</a> about the making of the much-awaited Disney film, the need for a sequel to Frozen and much more.</p>
      <p>Here are excerpts from the conversation:</p>
      <p>
        <b>When did you decide to do Frozen 2?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Jennifer:</b> Unless it came from us, no one was going tell us we had to do Frozen 2. When we got talking a year after Frozen hit screens, we got so emotional. We realized that we had all these questions that we asked each other. We realised we were not ready to leave the Frozen universe. So, the minute we mentioned sequel, there was a lot of happiness. There was a complete embracing of it (from Disney) because people loved the characters and what we wanted to do with it. The great thing is that we have got a lot of support in a beautiful way.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Was it a challenge to make a sequel?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Chris:</b> We wanted to have our characters go to a different place and have them go outside Arendelle. We wanted to have new characters to expand this world. The challenge was how do you keep true to the characters and let them grow. There’s a challenge to keep them true.</p>
      <p><b>Peter:</b> When Frozen came out, it wasn’t our movie anymore. The film became the world’s movie and that was exciting to us. But with that comes a lot of expectations. Truthfully, we agreed that we would keep the success outside the room and really build Frozen 2 the same way we built the earlier one, which is really talking about characters first, then plot and then get the songwriters involved. If you let that outside pressure into the room, it can actually hinder the decisions we make for Anna and Elsa.</p>

      <p><b>Jennifer:</b> Challenges were much greater doing a sequel in terms of how and where do you go from here. But you have the foundation of these characters. They (the characters) were all a little bit of us and we all knew them so well. We were together in the entire process. We built the story, music and everything else true to these characters and the journey they take.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What are the messages you want children to take from Frozen 2?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Chris:</b> One of the things I love about the characters is that they never give up. Our characters, with all the challenges we throw at them, are incredibly strong. I think that is a really powerful message for everyone, not just young people.</p>
      <p><b>Jennifer:</b> Overall, Frozen doesn’t go into good versus evil as much as it looks at fear and love. The first film celebrated being different. The sequel looks at accepting change. Change is one of the hardest things in life and the fear of change can make you not act on the thing that is most important to you. The daring to do can be dangerous to you. So that wrestling of love and fear as each one of our characters are maturing, changing and confronting major change is what I think excited us.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Do you see Frozen universe expanding?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Chris:</b> We love these characters. We did not plan to make the sequel. So, you never know.</p>
