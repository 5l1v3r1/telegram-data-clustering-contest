      <p>Thick smoke has blanketed Sydney as firefighters brace for a ‘tough day’ with hot, dry and windy conditions prompting severe fire danger warnings across the state.</p>
      <p>Thick smoke across Sydney has given the city the unwanted title of worst air in the world, coming in 10 times worse than Beijing and Jakarta.</p>
      <p>The hot and windy conditions have sparked concerns 56 fires burning across the state could flare up and total fire bans have been declared in multiple regions.</p>
      <p>Residents in bushfire-prone areas are being told to monitor conditions and action their bushfire emergency plans.</p>

      <p>More than 20 schools across the state will be temporarily closed due to the bushfire threat.</p>
      <p>Temperatures are set to climb to 39C in Penrith and winds are set to lash the state with gusts of 30-50km/h before easing in the evening.</p>
      <p>Fire danger ratings have hit severe in the Greater Hunter, Sydney, Illawarra, Southern and Central Ranges, where a total fire ban is in place, and Very High and Severe across most of the state.</p>
      <p>More than 1300 firefighters are working to keep the fires at bay, with 28 yet to be contained.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the thick smoke from fires burning in the north has drifted into Sydney, with major health warnings being issued by authorities.</p>

      <p>The fires have caused hazardous air conditions, with particle levels in the air likely to cause issues for anyone with breathing difficulties.</p>
      <p>Sydney’s east, northwest slopes and parts of the southwest are choking through hazardous levels while other parts of the state are struggling through very poor and poor ratings.</p>
      <p>The RFS has issued a stern warning for most of the state, urging those with respiratory conditions such as asthma to stay inside where possible, use reliever medication and seek medical help if needed.</p>

      <p>A southerly change later in the day is set to bring temperatures down before heatwave conditions hit fire grounds again on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Tuesday and Thursday will be “tough days”, RFS Deputy Commissioner Rob Rogers said.</p>
      <p>Already six lives and 530 homes have been lost since the state’s bushfire season began just weeks ago, with more than 420 homes destroyed in the past fortnight.</p>
      <p>The fires have burnt through 1.6 million hectares of land - more land loss than the entire 1993/1994 season.</p>
      <p>Firefighters were on Monday battling a firefront of some 6000km, the equivalent distance of a return Sydney-Perth trip, Mr Rogers said.</p>
      <p>Mr Rogers said firefighters were “singularly focused” on preventing further loss of life and property and warned people to stay alert.</p>
      <p>“Even though it’s not a catastrophic danger (this week) it’s still going to be bad fire days,” he said.</p>

      <p>He urged anyone who had not yet been affected by bushfires to “please use this as a wake-up call”, warning them to take steps including cleaning out gutters and having a fire safety plan in place.</p>
      <p>Premier Gladys Berejiklian asked everyone to “maintain their vigilance”. Emergency Services Minister David Elliott said the biggest risk in the coming days would be firefighters becoming fatigued.</p>
      <p>A DC10 air tanker had been drafted in from North America to help drop up to 38,000 litres of water and retardant on blazes and efforts will be bolstered by help from New Zealand firefighters, Mr Elliott said.</p>
