      <h1>Braid: In brazen move, UCP fires the commissioner investigating its leadership scandal</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T02:01:51+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 02:01</time> by <a rel="author">Don Braid, Calgary Herald</a></address>
      <p>It looks like a little red-tape reduction thing, buried amid a lot of detail in the UCP’s new Bill 22, introduced Monday.</p>
      <p>But this is a genuine gasping shocker that will be controversial in Alberta for a long time.</p>
      <p>The bill cancels the contract of Election Commissioner Lorne Gibson, who has been hitting UCP leadership campaign operatives with massive fines — $210,000 worth, as of early November.</p>
      <p>Bill 22 rolls the commission duties into Elections Alberta, the outfit that governs the wider realm of running and regulating elections.</p>
      <p>Chief electoral officer Glen Resler can decide if he wants to rehire Gibson, whose job was to enforce the election and financing laws.</p>
      <p>The government says current investigations will continue, whether Gibson is retained or not. All fines and penalties are still valid. All this has nothing to do with Premier Jason Kenney, they say.</p>
      <p>But holy illicit donation, who wouldn’t suspect they’re slamming the lid on this raging investigation?</p>
      <p>Opposition Leader Rachel Notley called the move “an absolutely unprecedented abuse of power.</p>
      <p>“Imagine if (Prime Minister Justin) Trudeau had fired the ethics commission during the SNC-Lavalin affair,” she said.</p>
      <p>“Imagine if former prime minister Paul Martin had fired the Gomery Commission (into the Liberal sponsorship scandal).</p>
      <p>“This is that serious, without precedent in Alberta.”</p>
      <p>Gibson has certainly enforced the financing law with a vigour that shocked the UCP.</p>
      <p>Most of the fines have arisen from the so-called kamikaze candidate leadership of Jeff Callaway, who was said to be a stalking horse planted to discredit Brian Jean and help Jason Kenney win in 2017.</p>

      <p>Just this month, Gibson fined a fellow named Robyn Lore $17,000, in part for furnishing another player, Cameron Davies, with $60,000.</p>
      <p>That money came from Agropyron Enterprises “for the purpose of making a contribution to Jeff Callaway,” Gibson said.</p>
      <p>There’s plenty more; months and months of multiple fines with big totals for several individuals.</p>
      <p>This has never touched Kenney directly. He denies all knowledge.</p>
      <p>But this continuing investigation, with no end in sight, is a background shadow on his astonishingly successful climb to power.</p>
      <p>The best one can say, I suppose, is that the UCP deserves a chance to show they actually mean the promise to continue the investigations.</p>
      <p>But if nothing is to change, why do this at all?</p>
      <p>The campaign to cut red tape is a slender excuse.</p>
      <p>In its first year of operations, Gibson’s group was well within its year-over-year budget of $1.3 million.</p>
      <p>Gibson has also recouped more than $210,000 of his spending in fines. This may be the most fiscally successful operation in the entire legislature.</p>
      <p>And won’t Elections Alberta spend more once it picks up Gibson’s work?</p>

      <p>The government argues that there is no other election commissioner strictly for enforcement in Canada. They call it a wasteful duplication of a responsibility that rightly belongs to the chief electoral officer.</p>
      <p>But there is a history with Gibson. And the UCP does not like it.</p>
      <p>Party leadership financing had been unregulated before the <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/politics/whats-next-for-political-action-committees-as-govt-eyes-new-rules">NDP passed laws in 2017</a>.</p>
      <p>The NDP also created the election commission to enforce the law and hired Gibson to run it.</p>
      <p>He had once been the province’s chief electoral officer, until Progressive Conservative MLAs pushed him out in 2009.</p>
      <p>They were unhappy with his constant efforts to modernize the electoral system, while pointing out many little ways the PCs were gaming it.</p>
      <p>Gibson handed in a report with 182 recommendations. He noted that in the 2008 election, 27 per cent of voters had been left off the list.</p>
      <p>He also said some riding returning officers were, hmm, a bit too close to the local PC MLAs.</p>
      <p>Gibson sued for wrongful dismissal, unsuccessfully.</p>
      <p>And then, in 2018, the NDP hired him back.</p>
      <p>Now he sets a bizarre Alberta record.</p>
      <p>He is the first officer of the legislature to be fired twice in one decade by two different kinds of conservative governments.</p>
      <p>The UCP is well aware there will be a gigantic uproar over this. But they also believe that out there in the wider public, there isn’t much concern about the leadership scandal.</p>
      <p>It wasn’t a real election, after all, and people expect leaderships to be rough and tumble, right?</p>
      <p>So, they think all this will settle right down. Once people stop gasping.</p>
