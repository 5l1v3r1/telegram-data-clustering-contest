      <h1>Japan ruling party's Nikai: Need JPY 10 trln extra budget - Jiji</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T02:01:30+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 02:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/dhwani-mehta" target="_blank">Dhwani Mehta</a></address>
      <p>Reuters reports the latest headlines carried by the Japanese Jiji press, citing Japanese senior ruling party official Toshihiro Nikai’s comments on the country’s stimulus plans.</p>
      <p>NIkai said the government must compile a supplementary budget of around 10 trillion yen ($92 billion) for the current fiscal year.</p>
      <p>The government plans to compile a stimulus package as soon as possible as a pre-emptive measure against heightening overseas risks, Japan’s PM Abe had hinted earlier this month.</p>

      <p>USD/JPY is off the lows but remains on the back foot, as the anti-risk Yen benefits from the fresh US-China trade jitters. CNBC reported on Monday that China is pessimistic about agreeing a deal, which suggests a resolution to perhaps the biggest risk to the global economy remains elusive.</p>
