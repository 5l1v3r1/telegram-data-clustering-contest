      <p>Jamal Pieze, was pronounced dead at an area hospital after the Sunday night shooting, the <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/crime/article237476409.html">Miami Herald</a> reported.</p>
      <p>Two other people, including a 13-year-old who was shot in the head, also were taken to the hospital, <a href="https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/Triple-Shooting-Leaves-1-Dead-Teen-Shot-in-Head-in-NW-Miami-Dade-565085262.html">WTVJ</a> reported. The teen was listed in critical but stable condition, the television station reported.</p>
      <p>According to a news release issued by the Miami-Dade Police Department, three men opened fire at a gathering shortly after 11 p.m. Sunday.</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately, the 13-year-old was struck in the head while he was inside the residence during the gathering," Detective Alvaro Zabaleta, of the Miami-Dade Police Department, told <a href="https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/Triple-Shooting-Leaves-1-Dead-Teen-Shot-in-Head-in-NW-Miami-Dade-565085262.html">WTVJ.</a> The other victim was a 21-year-old man who was treated and released from the hospital early Monday, the television station reported.</p>
      <p>In 2015, Pieze, then 16, was a football player at Miami Jackson High School. He was shot seven times while he walked to a grocery store in Miami, the <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/crime/article237476409.html">Herald</a> reported.</p>
      <p>The 10th-grader was ambushed by two assailants, who began shooting at him, <a href="https://miami.cbslocal.com/2015/12/20/miami-teen-survives-after-being-shot-seven-times/">WFOR</a> reported.</p>
      <p>As Pieze ran, the attackers chased him and kept firing, the television station reported.</p>
      <p>The men who fired at the home Sunday night and killed Pieze remained free Monday night, the <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/crime/article237476409.html">Herald</a> reported. Police said they considered the shooters "armed and dangerous," the newspaper reported.</p>
