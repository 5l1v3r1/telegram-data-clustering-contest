      <h3>Amazon Has Renewed Their Upcoming ‘Lord Of The Rings’ TV Series For Season 2</h3>
      <p>

      <p>Amazon Studios has officially renewed its high-profile <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/lord-of-the-rings/"><i>Lord of the Rings</i></a> television show for a second season before the series has even premiered, <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/the-lord-of-the-rings-series-renewed-season-2-amazon-early-renewal-season-1-hiatus-writers-room-reassembled-1202788730/"><i>Deadline</i></a> reports. At present, the television series is preparing to enter pre-production on location for its highly-anticipated first season. <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5642228/amazons-lord-of-the-rings-shot-new-zealand/"><i>The Inquisitr</i></a> previously reported that the fantasy series will shoot in New Zealand.</p>
      <p>However, in light of the early renewal, fans may have to wait a little longer for an official premiere date.</p>
      <p>To accommodate more planning time for their writers, <i>Deadline</i> states that Amazon will put the series’ production on a 4.5-month-long hiatus after the first two episodes have completed filming. The studio wants to ensure that there are no conflicts in storylines between the direction of Season 1 and 2 by allowing the writers to re-group early in production.</p>
      <p>Nothing about this is out of the ordinary, or a sign that fans should worry. Since the series received a straight-to-series order, it will skip the traditional pilot approval process. Instead, the first two episodes will be used to evaluate the series and decide what needs improvement. <i>Deadline</i> claims that director Peter Jackson also used this tactic while making the film series.</p>
      <blockquote>“That was a strategy used by Peter Jackson in shooting his blockbuster <i>LOTR</i> movie trilogy, also in New Zealand. That is considered a sensible approach for big-budget productions like <i>LOTR</i> as it helps find efficiencies because every filming ramp-up is expensive.”</blockquote>
      <p>Amazon purchased the rights to J.R.R. Tolkein’s works back in 2017 as part of a massive multi-million dollar deal. The initial contract required the streaming service to make a multi-season commitment to the project, so the renewal is not too much of a surprise.</p>

      <p>Nonetheless, it is still exciting and a great relief to fans worried about the show’s future, considering it has no current air date in sight.</p>
      <p>People who love the iconic franchise can rest easy knowing they don’t have to fret about a potential sudden cancelation for a while, at least. Many of them have taken to social media to express their excitement over the renewal news.</p>
      <p>“I mean you pay 260 million for the rights it better be 6 seasons,” expressed one user.</p>
      <p>“That’s what I’m Tolkien about,” joked another fan.</p>

      <p>“To say I’m excited would be an understatement,” remarked a third person.</p>
      <p>Some users are understandably a little confused that the show has been renewed for a second season when no trailer for the first season has been released.</p>
      <p>“What do mean season 2???? There’s a season 1????” asked one perplexed user.</p>
      <p>We may not know when Amazon’s series will debut, but we do know that the series will take place before the events of <i>The</i> <i>Lord of the Rings:</i> <i>The Fellowship of the Ring.</i></p>
