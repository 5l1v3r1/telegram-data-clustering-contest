      <h1>U of C to cut 250 positions following provincial budget</h1>

      <p>The University of Calgary will be eliminating 250 positions due to <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/universities-and-colleges-preparing-for-10-per-cent-cut-next-year-internal-email-says/wcm/d916fd6c-a59f-48b0-9938-8a0e6427c9d5">budget cuts</a> announced by the provincial government last month, officials said Monday.</p>
      <p>The university faces “significant budgetary challenges” in light of the provincial budget and had to make “difficult decisions” for its in-year budget, president and vice-chancellor Ed McCauley said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“Our budget decisions are informed by our Eyes High 2017-22 Strategy and our Academic and Research roadmaps,” McCauley said. “These guiding documents provide direction for us in good and challenging times about the allocation of our human, capital, and financial resources.”</p>
      <p>Out of the 250 positions the university will be eliminating, a total of 100 positions are being abolished through retirements, vacancies and resignations, McCauley said. The other 150 jobs will be cut in two phases, with the first this month, followed by a second phase in mid-January.</p>
      <p>The Alberta Union of Provincial Employees called the news of the job cuts “proof of more broken promises from the UCP.”</p>
      <p>“The UCP was elected on a promise of creating jobs, but now we are losing hundreds of positions at just one university. Imagine how many hundreds more will be lost at universities and colleges across the province,” said Bobby-Joe Borodey, vice-president of AUPE, which represents some of those affected by the job cuts.</p>
      <p>“The government also said most of the jobs it wanted to axe in the public sector would be through attrition. That’s another broken promise. The University of Calgary said today that 150 full-time positions would be terminated and 100 lost to attrition.”</p>
