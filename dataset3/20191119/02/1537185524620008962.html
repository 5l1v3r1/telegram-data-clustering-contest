      <p>AMARILLO, Texas (KFDA) - The number of cigarette smokers in the nation is at a record low, according to the CDC.</p>
      <p>As of now, United States smokers were recorded at 13.7-percent, which is roughly two thirds lower than the initial start of the collecting of this data in 1965.</p>
      <p>Although smoking is at an all-time low nationally, the Harrington Cancer and Health Foundation confirms cigarette smokers in this area are on the rise.</p>
      <p>“Amarillo Area Public Health Department showed local tobacco users are trying to quit at a much lower rate now than they were five years ago,” said Board of Directors for Tobacco-Free Amarillo Trudy Tripp-Smith. “In 2018 31-percent of smokers have tried to quit in the previous 12 months, but that compared to 56-percent in 2013. So with those numbers decreasing, we have a lot more work to do with people who want to quit.”</p>
      <p>The Harrington Cancer and Health Foundation is now implementing new programs geared towards helping people with the quitting process.</p>
      <p>“Tobacco Free Amarillo is trying to be non-judgmental to everyone. We do have a quit Facebook group called ‘Quit Monday Amarillo,’ and it lets people join who are trying to quit or those supporting a loved one trying to stop,” said Tripp-Smith.</p>
      <p>This page consists of things like advice, online support chat rooms, and ways for people to discuss their progress for self-motivation or motivating others.</p>
      <p>This page comes from the “Quit Monday’s” incentive, which is a program allowing people to take their time during the quitting process.</p>
      <p>Tobacco-Free Amarillo is also now dedicated to lowering the number of the city’s youth who are smokers or vapors.</p>
