      <h2>Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel have announced they will hike tariffs starting December 1, following record second-quarter losses reported by the two operators. The stocks may react to the development</h2>

      <p>In the absence of any major positive triggers both on the domestic and global front, investors are expected to remain cautious like in yesterday's session. Therefore, another range-bound session may be on the cards today with investors looking at global cues, the rupee's trajectory, oil price movement, and foreign fund flow for market direction.</p>
      <p>Major developments that may impact investor sentiment:<br/><br/>According to a report in today's issue of Business Standard, the government is focusing on private investment, economic growth, and tax incentives for the 2020-21 Union Budget. As per the report, long-term capital gains tax may be scraped and the burden of dividend distribution tax could perhaps be shifted from companies to shareholders.</p>
      <p>In another news, telecom operators Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel have announced they will hike tariffs starting December 1, following record second-quarter losses reported by the two operators. The stocks may react to the development today.</p>
      <p>Also, according to a report by a business <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/markets-news-1060101.htm">news </a>portal, private equity firm Carlyle has launched a block deal to sell around a 3 percent stake in SBI Life Insurance. Carlyle currently holds 9 per cent stake in the company.</p>
      <p>Global markets:</p>
      <p>Asian shares started Tuesday softer in absence of any major trigger. MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.1 per cent. Japan's Nikkei was 0.2 per cent lower in early trade. Australia's S&amp;P/ASX 200 index was flat. Wall Street’s main indexes were also mostly flat. SGX Nifty, on the other hand, was trading lower in early hours, indicating a negative start to the day for the domestic indices.</p>
      <p>In commodities, Brent crude futures fell 1.6 per cent to $62.29 a barrel.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, benchmark indices ended flat after a listless day. The S&amp;P BSE Sensex ended at 40,284, down 73 points, while the broader Nifty50 index ended 1 point down at 11,894.</p>
      <p>For today, analysts recommend that traders should keep a positive bias and buy Nifty futures at every dip keeping close eye on 11,780. For now, 12,000 will act as a major resistance while 11,800 will provide support to the index.</p>
      <p>Here's a trading idea by CapitalVia Global Research Limited who recommend buying JSW Steel above Rs 257 for a target of Rs 258 with stoploss at Rs 243.</p>
