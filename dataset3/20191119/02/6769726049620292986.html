      <h1>AFL Dockers re-sign Luke Ryan until 2023</h1>

      <p>FREMANTLE defender Luke Ryan has re-signed with the Dockers for a further three years, tying him to the AFL club until the end of 2023.</p>
      <p>Ryan was one of a number of players rumoured to be keen to exit the Dockers at the end of last season.</p>
      <p>Brad Hill (St Kilda) and Ed Langdon (Melbourne) ended up leaving, but Ryan has decided to commit for the long term.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old still had one year to run on his current deal, and said his family gave him their blessing to stay in Perth for longer.</p>

      <p>“I’ve got my family back home (in Melbourne) but when I spoke to them, we came to the conclusion that Fremantle gave me my chance – if it wasn’t for Fremantle I probably wouldn’t have been playing AFL,” Ryan said.</p>
      <p>“(Before) I was called out with pick 66 (in the 2016 national draft), I felt it was my last chance.</p>
      <p>“And luckily enough they called me. I owe it to Fremantle and what they’ve done for me, so I wanted to sign on.”</p>
      <p>Champion Data rates Ryan as elite for intercept possessions and intercept marks, with the defender ranking second for intercept possessions in the AFL in 2019.</p>
      <p>Ryan has played 49 games since making his debut in 2017.</p>
      <p>He will form a key part of the defensive unit under new coach Justin Longmuir, who replaced the axed Ross Lyon.</p>
