      <h2>Mzee Mohammed, who had autism, Asperger's and ADHD, sprinted around Liverpool town centre amidst a psychotic episode before collapsing and dying in hospital later that day</h2>

      <p>The final moments of a teenager's life running around a city centre before being forcibly detained by police have been played at an inquest into his death.</p>
      <p>Mzee Mohammed can be seen sweating profusely, running franticly and at points holding a knife as he makes his way around Liverpool City centre on July 13, 2016.</p>
      <p>The 18-year-old had been behaving strangely in the hours before his death, telling his dad Clement Daley that "police and white men" were trying to kill him, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/footage-harrowing-final-moments-teenagers-17277148">The Liverpool echo reported.</a></p>
      <p>Footage of his final moments was played at an inquest into his death on Monday.</p>
      <p>Mzee, who had autism, Asperger's and ADHD, can be seen sprinting around the Liverpool ONE shopping centre from the vantage point of numerous CCTV cameras.</p>
      <p>He then collapsed behind the counter of a fast food restaurant where police officers cuffed his hands behind his back while he lay on his front.</p>

      <p>Several minutes later he was loaded onto a stretcher and into an ambulance.</p>
      <p>He was pronounced dead at the  <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/royal-liverpool-hospital">Royal Liverpool Hospital</a>  at 7.52pm that evening, having suffered a cardiac arrest which a pathologist said had followed a period of "intense physical exertion."</p>
      <p>Two pathologists gave the cause of death as cardiorespiratory arrest with secondary factos.</p>
      <p>One said "severe physical exertion" was the secondary factor, while the other said a "period of struggle and restraint" contributed to his death.</p>
      <p>During the inquest into his death the senior coroner for Liverpool and Wirral, Andre Rebello, held a moment's silence in memory of the Toxteth born man.</p>
      <p>He told the jury of seven men and four women: " What I am going to tell you about is upsetting. Upsetting does not actually describe the heartbreaking and soul destroying events you are to see unfold.</p>
      <p>"Mzee was 18 years old when he died. He was an ordinary person, with an ordinary family, just like me and you...</p>
      <p>"Mzee was in the Liverpool ONE shopping centre on July 13, 2016. He had been behaving in a strange manner and appeared mentally unwell.</p>

      <p>"He had a knife in his hand for some of the time. And you will see, and hear about, you may agree that he appeared to be evading something or someone. He eventually collapsed at the bottom of the steps leading up the food court and the cinema.</p>
      <p>"You will make your own minds up as to what’s happening there. To me it was soul destroying seeing anybody’s 18 year-old son with autism and Asperger’s, desperate, exhausted."</p>
      <p>At the time of his death the sports student was on a number of different medications for his learning conditions.</p>
      <p>Karla Mohammed, his mum, told the hearing how her son had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after he was stabbed and slashed 14 times "by a group of white lads" in 2014.</p>
      <p>In the wake of the attack Mzee had started carrying a knife with him, fearing they would come and "finish him off", his mother said.</p>

      <p>It seems the teenager had not taken his medication in the weeks leading up to his death.</p>
      <p>He left his mum's house to go and see his dad on the morning of July 13.</p>
      <p>However that afternoon Mr Daley phoned Ms Mohammed to say: "I can see fear in my boy’s eyes, something is not right."</p>
      <p>The mum ordered a taxi for her boy, but when it arrived Mzee was no longer in the house.</p>
      <p>It appears he had escaped through a window.</p>
      <p>Ms Mohammed called the mental health crisis team at the Royal Liverpool Hospital, who advised taking Mzee into A&amp;E, and she also contacted Merseyside Police.</p>
      <p>In the aftermath of his death Lancashire Constabulary and the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) traced Mzee's movements in the next half an hour.</p>

      <p>At one point he was spotted approaching a group of screaming teenage girls while holding a kitchen knife.</p>
      <p>One of the girls said to police that he told her "give me your phone, are you blind?" before walking away.</p>
      <p>In the chaotic minutes after this incident, Mzee was seen wandering in and out of Cass Art shop on School Lane, no longer wearing any footwear, and then snatched a woman's phone in Hotel Chocolat on Peter's Lane.</p>
      <p>DC Cloherty told the hearing the woman, Lauren Price, and her friend, Josh Didsley, challenged Mzee and he immediately handed it back, offering no threats or aggression.</p>
      <p>By this point he had dropped the knife.</p>
      <p>Ms Price and Mr Didsley formed the impression that Mzee was suffering a "mental health episode".</p>
      <p>They said he was sweating heavily and seemed "vacant and paranoid".</p>
      <p>Over the next few minutes he knocked a woman to the ground while running past her and pushed a man onto the floor before sprinting away.</p>

      <p>While the final moments of his life were played to the court his family left the room in distress.</p>
      <p>Mzee could be seen sprinting down the steep steps, only just maintaining his balance, before falling heavily to the ground on the concrete at the bottom.</p>
      <p>He was recorded trying to get to his feet several times, but falling back to the ground.</p>
      <p>He eventually clambered over the counter of Chips A Gogo kiosk where he was detained by Liverpool ONE staff and then Merseyside Police officers.</p>
      <p>For a short period officers appear to be detaining Mzee, who is not visible to the camera as he is obscured below the counter, before they carry him out and lay him on the concrete on his front.</p>

      <p>Officers can be heard discussing Mzee "running around assaulting people" before an ambulance is called.</p>
      <p>A police body camera captures one exchange where an officer says: "Can we check his pulse and get him in the recovery position?"</p>
      <p>Another replies: "Every time he’s come round he’s kicked off.”</p>
      <p>The first officer says: "Well he’s in the half recovery position, that’s the best we’re going to get isn’t it."</p>
      <p>The inquest is expected to hear from a large number of witnesses and is estimated to last four weeks.</p>
