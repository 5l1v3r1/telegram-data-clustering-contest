      <h1>Thierry Henry explains decision behind surprise return to management at Montreal Impact</h1>
      <h2>Eyebrows were raised when the Arsenal legend was announced as the new boss of the Canadian MLS team but Henry has insisted he is up to the challenge</h2>

      <p>Thierry Henry said he has learned from his miserable spell in charge of Monaco after he was <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/breaking-thierry-henry-named-new-20880526">unveiled as the new manager of Montreal Impact</a> .</p>
      <p>Henry, who is Arsenal's all-time top scorer with 228 goals, took his first management job at Monaco last year, but was sacked just over three months after taking charge following a dreadful run of form which saw him record four wins, five draws and 11 defeats from 20 games.</p>
      <p>The 42-year-old has signed a two year deal with Montreal, with the option of an extension by one year, and speaking at his first press conference at the club he said he wanted to prove himself following his failure in France.</p>

      <p>"You're going to fall- it's about how you get up," he said.</p>
      <p>"You learn the most and find out more about yourself in the tough situations. It's about coming back always- the story of my life. The only mistake you can make is not learning from what happened.</p>
      <p>"You need to come back and confront it. I'm more than happy to have this opportunity with this club and this country.</p>
      <p>"You have to start somewhere. That's how you acquire experience. For me it came with Belgium and Monaco, where I learned a lot about myself."</p>
      <p>Montreal play in the Eastern Conference in Major League Soccer, and parted ways with their last manager Wilmer Cabrera when they failed to make the play-offs last season.</p>

      <p>The MLS SuperDraft takes place in January in Baltimore, with teams choosing players who have just graduated from college. Montreal have the ninth pick in the first round.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.mundodeportivo.com/futbol/fc-barcelona/20191117/471668632952/barca-henry-entrenador-milito-segundo.html">Mundo Deportivo</a> another of Henry's former clubs, <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> , were considering a shock move for him to become their manager while current boss Ernesto Valverde was stalling on signing a contract extension, but in the end decided against it.</p>
