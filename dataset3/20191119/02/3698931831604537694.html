      <p>Yes, the 4G LTE network operated by YTL Communications is now 9 years old. To celebrate the occasion, they are giving free 1GB of data to its customers and you must redeem it before 11:59PM on 19th November 2019.</p>
      <p>The promo is applicable to active prepaid and postpaid data customers and you can redeem it via <a href="https://selfcare.yes.my/myselfcare/doLogin.do">MyAccount/Selfcare</a> or via the <a href="https://selfcare.yes.my/myselfcare/doExpressPay.do">Express Reload</a>. According to the T&amp;C, the promo is offered for prepaid and postpaid “data tonnage” plans and it isn’t applicable to Konfem LTE Data Add-on, <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2018/09/19/yes-4g-prepaid-unlimited-data-konfem-4g-turbo/">Konfem Unlimited Prepaid</a> and <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2019/01/19/yes-konfem-unlimited-postpaid/">Konfem Unlimited postpaid</a> plan customers.</p>
      <p>Yes was launched on 19th November 2010 as a <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2010/11/19/yes-4g-service-launched-with-usb-dongle-mifi-device/">WiMAX provider</a> and they offer a wide range of devices from USB modems, Huddle MiFi, WiMAX phones, fixed wireless terminal and even a WiMAX-enabled Chromebook.
