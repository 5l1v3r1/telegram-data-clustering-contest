      <p>Dubai Mercantile Exchange (DME), the premier international energy futures exchange in the Middle East, has announced a 21 percent increase year-on-year in exchange trading activities, along with 172 percent increase in forward curve trading, following Saudi Aramco’s adoption of DME Oman in its official selling price in October 2018.<br/>In 2019, DME registered an average daily volume of 5.97 million barrels of crude oil from January to October, up from 4.95 million barrels for the same period in 2018. Forward curve activities reached a total of 600.7 million barrels from January to October 2019, compared with 223.2 million barrels in the corresponding period in 2018.<br/>Raid Al-Salami, managing director, DME, said: “We are witnessing a growing interest among crude oil sellers and buyers to trade and participate in the price discovery through DME, the only regulated energy exchange in the biggest oil-producing regions.”<br/>“DME today plays a major role as the most reliable pricing point for Middle Eastern crude oil going East, due to its growing and diversified customer base, the transparency of DME Oman benchmark and its ability to capture the real supply-demand situation in the East of Suez market. The tremendous growth we experienced over the first 10 months of the year is a true testimony to our unmatched credentials.”</p>
