      <p>The 22-year-old attacked his victim in January 2019 after she was called to a scene in Melbourne's north.</p>
      <p>Monica, who doesn't want her surname used, told the court she was "constantly feeling choked" and suffered ongoing "distressing flashbacks".</p>
      <p>"I have lost all of my independence due to this assault," the paramedic told the court as she wept on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Wearing her paramedic uniform, the victim apologised before she continued with her emotional statement.</p>

      <p>She told the judge she has not been able to return to work as a paramedic due to her psychological and physical injuries.</p>
      <p>Magistrate Simon Zebrowski decided in August not to send Haberfield to jail because of his age, pre-existing autism spectrum disorder and increased risk of suicide in custody.</p>

      <p>Haberfield had gone into a psychotic state after the four-day Rainbow Serpent festival, where he'd consumed a cocktail of drugs including ice, MDMA and ketamine, the court was told.</p>
      <p>His family initially took him to hospital after the festival but he fled and walked into a Coburg home, terrifying the residents.</p>
      <p>When paramedics arrived, Haberfield punched Monica to the face, put her in a headlock, and squeezed and pinned her to the back door of the ambulance.</p>
      <p>Her colleague, Sam Smith, avoided the young man's punches before hitting the vehicle's duress button and sedating Haberfield.</p>
      <p>"The incident has made me extremely angry about what has happened," he said in a statement to police.</p>
      <p>The appeal in front of Judge Michael Tinney continues.</p>
