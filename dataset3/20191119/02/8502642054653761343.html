      <p>SYDNEY, Nov 19 (Reuters) - U.S. corn futures on Tuesday rebounded from a two-month low touched in the previous session, after the U.S. Department of Agriculture pegged the harvest pace below market expectations.</p>
      <p>FUNDAMENTALS</p>
      <p>* The most active corn futures on the Chicago Board Of Trade were up 0.2% at $3.68-1/2 a bushel, as of 0145 GMT, after settling down 0.9% on Monday when prices hit a Sept. 18 low of $3.67-1/2 a bushel.</p>
      <p>* The most active soybean futures were up 0.1% at $9.11-1/2 a bushel. In the previous session, soybean futures closed down 0.9%, when prices hit an Oct. 4 low of $9.10 a bushel.</p>
      <p>* The most active wheat futures were down 0.1% at $5.06-3/4 a bushel, having closed up 0.9% on Monday.</p>
      <p>* The USDA said the U.S. corn harvest was 76% complete, slightly behind market forecasts.</p>
      <p>* The U.S soybean harvest was pegged at 91% complete, matching market forecasts.</p>
      <p>* A CNBC report cited that the mood in Beijing was pessimistic due to U.S. President Donald Trump's reluctance to roll back tariffs, dampening sentiment among global investors.</p>
      <p>* Chinese state media had said Washington and Beijing held "constructive talks" on trade in a high-level phone call on Saturday that included Vice Premier Liu He, U.S. trade representative Robert Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.</p>
      <p>MARKET NEWS</p>
      <p>* The dollar nursed losses against major currencies on Tuesday as receding hopes for a preliminary trade deal between the United States and China hurt demand for the greenback.</p>
      <p>* Oil prices fell more than 1% on Monday, erasing much of last week's gains and tumbling alongside U.S. stocks on uncertainty over a trade deal.</p>
      <p>* Wall Street's three main indexes on Monday barely extended the previous session's closing records as investors waited for concrete progress on U.S.-China trade relations after mixed headlines.</p>
