      <h3>Ariel Winter Looks Stunning In Magical Snap From Amsterdam, Jokes ‘Farewell Forever LA’</h3>

      <p><i>Modern Family</i> star <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/ariel-winter/">Ariel Winter</a> recently shared a snap from her trip to Amsterdam with her eager 4 million followers on the social media platform.</p>
      <p>While Ariel isn’t afraid to flaunt her curves in pictures, in this particular snap, she was covered up on what appeared to be a chilly day. In the photo, Ariel stood on a bridge crossing over a canal that was filled with small boats. A bicycle was leaning against the railing right beside her, and she smiled at the camera while posing in a black coat and black pants. The brunette bombshell had a black purse hanging off one shoulder, her brunette locks tumbling down her back in soft curls.</p>
      <p>Ariel’s makeup was natural and allowed her beauty to shine through. Her pale skin looked flawless in the snap, and she appeared to be wearing minimal eye makeup and a soft pink shade on her lips.</p>
      <p>The sky was just beginning to darken in the shot, and the trees along either side of the canal were covered in white holiday lights. They cast a glow over the entire street, and also reflected off the water in the canal for a particularly magical snap. Ariel made a joke in the caption of the post, telling her followers that she had canceled her return ticket to Los Angeles.</p>

      <p>The actress’s followers loved her snap from abroad, and the post quickly racked up over 183,900 likes within just eight hours. The brunette bombshell even received a like from her television mom, actress Julie Bowen.</p>
      <p>Many of her followers took to the comments section to share their thoughts on the picture from her Amsterdam adventures.</p>
      <p>One fan opted to take a risk and flirt with Ariel in his comment and said, “since you’re clearly in Amsterdam, you wanna meet up for drinks?”</p>
      <p>Another fan was feeling the whole vibe of the photo.</p>

      <blockquote>“Such a great picture! This should be your holiday card. The lights are so pretty and festive.”</blockquote>
      <p>“Literally a postcard. Love this,” another fan said.</p>
      <p>“What a view,” another fan said, not clarifying whether he was discussing the scenery in the Netherlands or Ariel herself.</p>
      <p>The snap comes only a day after Ariel shared a <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5748530/ariel-winter-black-minidress-nolan-gould/">throwback picture</a> of herself in Las Vegas from a month ago. The brunette bombshell was in Sin City to celebrate her co-star Nolan Gould’s 21st birthday as she rocked a sizzling black mini dress for the occasion.</p>
