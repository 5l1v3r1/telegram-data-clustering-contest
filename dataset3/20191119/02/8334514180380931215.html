      <p>“I’ll defer to the White House about particular statements and the like. I don’t have anything else today about the Democrats’ impeachment proceedings,” he said in response to a question about whether he agreed with Trump’s negative assessment of Yovanovitch.</p>
      <p>“If somebody else has a substantive question about something that the world cares deeply about then I’m happy to take it.”</p>
