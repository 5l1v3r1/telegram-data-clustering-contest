      <p>Eight persons were confirmed dead in Felele on the Lokoja-Abuja Expressway, Lokoja, on Monday, in an accident involving a petrol tanker and other vehicles.</p>
      <p>Many vehicles, including tricycles, were also burnt as a result of the fire that followed the crash, while many people sustained varying degrees of injury.</p>
      <p>Our correspondent, who visited the scene, gathered that the driver of the petrol-laden truck lost control around the NNPC filling station as the vehicle suffered a brake failure.</p>
      <p>Eyewitnesses stated that the tanker rammed into four tricycles, two motorcycles, three cars and a bus, spilled its content on them and the ensuing fire consumed them.</p>
      <p>However, men of the state fire service rushed to the scene to extinguish the fire.</p>
      <p>Most of the filling stations in the area were closed, while men of the fire service were strategically positioned to prevent the spread of the fire.</p>
      <p>Officials of the Federal Road Safety Corps were also on the ground to evacuate the corpses of the deceased, while those who were injured were rushed to hospitals.</p>
      <p>According to the FRSC, the crash occurred around 8.50am at the Felele area along the Lokoja-Abuja Expressway as a result of brake failure on the part of a white DAF petrol-laden tanker with number plate JEG 141 XA.</p>
      <p>Seventeen persons were said to be involved in the accident, out of which eight were killed, while seven were injured.</p>
      <p>The victims were taken to the Federal Medical Centre and the Specialist Hospital, Lokoja, by the FRSC.</p>
