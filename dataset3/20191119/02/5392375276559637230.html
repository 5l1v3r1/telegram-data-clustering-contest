      <p>iOS 13.2.3 update brings several bug fixes<br/>4 (80%) 3 votes</p>
      <p>Two months have passed since the release of iOS 13, but Apple has been consistently providing incremental updates to fix issues and improve the performance of its ecosystem. Today, the company is <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/ios_1323_released_with_additional_bug_fixes-news-40152.php">rolling out iOS 13.2.3 for eligible devices</a>. In addition, there’s iPadOS with the same 13.2.3 version that comes with bug fixes and performance improvements. The update is rather small, weighing just 90MB. So don’t expect to see groundbreaking features coming with it.</p>

      <h3>iOS 13.2.3 changelog</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixes an issue where system search and search within Mail, Files, and Notes might not work</li>
        <li>Addresses an issue where photos, links, and other attachments might not display in the Messages details view</li>
        <li>Fixes an issue that could prevent apps from downloading content in the background</li>
        <li>Resolves issues that may prevent Mail from fetching new messages, and fail to include and quote original message content in Exchange accounts</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The latest major version of Apple OS didn’t come in the most stable state. That explains why we are seeing so many incremental updates coming in a monthly basis. Still, it’s good to see that the Cupertino-based firm is committed in offering a good software experience for the owners of its iDevices. We believe that today’s update won’t squash all bugs present in the software. However, Apple should keep providing these small updates with bug fixes in the coming months.</p>
