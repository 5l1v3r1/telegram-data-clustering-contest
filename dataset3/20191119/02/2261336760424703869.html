      <h1>BKFC announces signing of ‘Iranian Hulk’, who will debut in early 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T02:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 02:00</time> by <a rel="author">Tim Burke</a></address>
      <p>The “Iranian Hulk” has found a combat sports home. 27-year-old Sajad Gharibi, a powerlifter from Ahwaz, Iran that has gained a sizeable social media following for his very unique build, will compete in bare-knuckle boxing for BKFC. The promotion announced the signing on the preliminary portion of their show over the weekend.</p>
      <p>Gharibi has flirted with fighting before, <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/4/27/18519299/massive-powerlifter-iranian-hulk-teases-mma-debut">almost taking an MMA fight in Brazil</a> earlier this year.</p>
      <p>BKFC president David Feldman explained the signing and what the promotion will do with their latest acquisition (<a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2019/11/17/20968703/bare-knuckle-fighting-championship-announces-iranian-hulk-for-2020">via MMA Fighting</a>):</p>
      <p>“This guy’s going to make his Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship debut in early 2020,” he said. “We’re going to do a show entitled ‘USA vs. Iran: World War III.’ He’s literally our biggest signing we’ve ever had. But he’s going to make his way over to Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship, he’s gonna make a home here, and we expect really, really big things from ‘The Iranian Hulk.’”</p>
      <p>Bare Knuckle FC hasn’t announced a firm date for the Hulk’s debut as of yet.</p>
