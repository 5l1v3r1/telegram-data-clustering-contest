      <p>Gold inched up to its highest in more</p>
      <p>than 1-1/2 weeks on Tuesday, as fresh doubts about a trade deal</p>
      <p>between the United States and China dented appetite for riskier</p>
      <p>assets.</p>
      <p>FUNDAMENTALS</p>
      <p>* Spot gold rose 0.2% to $1,473.04 per ounce by 0105</p>
      <p>GMT. It had hit the highest level since Nov.7 at $1,475.40.</p>
      <p>* U.S. gold futures edged up 0.2% to $1,474.10 per</p>
      <p>ounce.</p>
      <p>* Citing a government source, CNBC reported that Beijing was</p>
      <p>pessimistic about a trade deal with the United States, troubled</p>
      <p>by President Donald Trump’s comments that there was no agreement</p>
      <p>on rollback of tariffs.</p>
      <p>* Asian shares started Tuesday softer as another day</p>
      <p>awaiting clearer news on the progress of trade negotiations</p>
      <p>between the two major economies weighed on jaded investors’</p>
      <p>sentiment.</p>
      <p>* The United States is gravely concerned about deepening</p>
      <p>political unrest and violence in Hong Kong, Secretary of State</p>
      <p>Mike Pompeo said, urging the city’s government to tackle public</p>
      <p>concerns and China to honor its promises of liberties.</p>
      <p>* China’s top legislature said Hong Kong courts had no power</p>
      <p>to rule on the constitutionality of legislation under the Asian</p>
      <p>financial hub’s Basic Law, which includes a proposed ban on face</p>
      <p>masks, state news agency Xinhua said.</p>
      <p>* The dollar held close to a two-week low, with</p>
      <p>demand hurt by receding hopes for a preliminary trade truce.</p>
      <p>* Trump and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell met at the</p>
      <p>White House on Monday, “to discuss the economy, growth,</p>
      <p>employment and inflation,” two days before the Fed is set to</p>
      <p>release the minutes of the year’s last policy meeting.</p>
      <p>* Canadian miner Barrick Gold Corp is keen to top</p>
      <p>its $1.5 billion target for asset sales after shedding its half</p>
      <p>of the Super Pit gold mine in Western Australia, Chief Executive</p>
      <p>Officer Mark Bristow said.</p>
      <p>* SPDR Gold Trust , the world’s largest gold-backed</p>
      <p>exchange-traded fund, said its holdings fell 0.56% to 891.79</p>
      <p>tonnes on Monday from 896.77 tonnes on Friday.</p>
      <p>* Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the bank would</p>
      <p>keep its monetary policy bias towards additional easing, in view</p>
      <p>of overseas risks that cloud the economic outlook.</p>
      <p>* Elsewhere, silver gained 0.2% to $17.05 an ounce,</p>
      <p>while palladium fell 0.4% to $1,730.17 an ounce. Platinum</p>
