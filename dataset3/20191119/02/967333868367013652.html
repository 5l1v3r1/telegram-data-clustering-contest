      <p>China's Ministry of Natural Resources announced on Friday that<a href="https://sputniknews.com/science/201809031067721127-base-editing-used-to-fix-mutated-dna/"> a group of scientists had discovered</a> a giant cluster of natural sinkholes consisting of 19 huge caverns in a forest between the towns of Chengxiang and Longhe in the county of Napo, Guangxi Zhuang, a southern part of the country bordering Vietnam.</p>
      <blockquote>The 19 caverns are reportedly spread “like a string of beads” around the basin of the underground river of Dingye, 60 km long, with a drop of 292 metres.</blockquote>
      <p>The volume of each of the caves is over one million cubic metres, and all are located at an altitude of over 1,000 metres, <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/QsKiOtNLHySrDuhhEJQExw">according to a statement</a> published by the ministry, which also posted pictures and video from inside the caves. Researchers also discovered primitive vegetation and trees <a href="https://sputniknews.com/science/201804081063329912-china-create-pig-huntington/">standing over 50 metres tall</a>.</p>

      <p>According to the ministry, the discovery of the sinkhole cluster is hope to cause a significant leap in the economy of geological tourism in Napo, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/science/201803281062987177-chinese-scientists-fusion-reactor/">famous for its Karst</a> geological formations.</p>
      <p>Beijing claims to possess the deepest underwater cave in the world, as well as over two-thirds of the world’s known natural sinkholes, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/science/201803261062903452-chinese-scientists-develop-shape-morphing-spacecraft/">including the planet's largest</a> sinkhole cluster.</p>
