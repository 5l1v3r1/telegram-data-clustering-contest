      <p>A thug broke a woman's jaw after she told him off for urinating in the sink when she was on the toilet.</p>
      <p>William Farrell, 35, urinated on the Michelle McDonald's hand after she complained about his disgusting behaviour, the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/snivelling-yob-broke-womans-jaw-17277162">Liverpool Echo</a> reports.</p>
      <p>He had only been seeing the victim for a few weeks when he took her back to his house in Liverpool after a night out.</p>
      <p>After she pushed the cocaine-fuelled lout away from her he smashed his TV, prompting her to flee the house in fear.</p>
      <p>Farrell chased his victim down Aberdale Road and delivered a vicious punch to her jaw, breaking it in three places.</p>

      <p>He claimed he acted in self-defence during a trial, but when being cross-examined, burst into tears and confessed: "I'm sorry."</p>
      <p>Farrell, of no fixed address, had denied inflicting grievous bodily harm (GBH) with intent and an alternative charge of inflicting GBH.</p>
      <p>The court heard he had been drinking and taking cocaine before the cowardly attack, in the early hours of September 26, 2018.</p>
      <p>Giving evidence during a two-day trial, Miss McDonald said Farrell punched her once or twice with a quick combination of blows.</p>
      <p>Paul Treble, prosecuting, told a jury how a neighbour came to her rescue, as she lay stricken in the street with the serious injury.</p>
      <p>However, he said brazen Farrell then came back and asked Miss McDonald for a cigarette, which she threw at him in disbelief.</p>
      <p>The victim was taken to hospital and required surgery, with metal plates being inserted in her jaw, but is now making a good recovery.</p>
      <p>She told the court she remains upset by her ordeal and has suffered from anxiety.</p>
      <p>Farrell, who gave a no comment interview when arrested by police, tried to suggest that Miss McDonald had attacked him first.</p>
      <p>When questioned by Mr Treble, he accepted that he urinated in the sink when she was on the toilet and claimed this was "normal".</p>
      <p>He denied urinating on her hand before he started crying and apologised for his attack, to the astonishment of a shocked jury.</p>
      <p>After being given time to speak to his barrister, Brendan Carville, he admitted the lesser offence, which was accepted by prosecutors.</p>
      <p>The court heard Farrell has previous convictions for offences including assault, burglary, theft and failing to comply with court orders.</p>
      <p>Mr Carville said his client had shown "real remorse" when he broke down crying in the middle of cross-examination.</p>
      <p>He said Farrell insisted it was only one punch and argued that it was not a case of "higher culpability", as set out in sentencing guidelines.</p>
      <p>The judge, Recorder Terence Rigby, said Farrell had "undoubtedly" inflicted a serious injury on his victim.</p>
      <p>He said: "My judgment as to what happened is that having drunk a great deal, having taken cocaine, you lost your temper and you lost your head.</p>
      <p>"You chased this girl down the street and when you caught her, your hit her with one punch but very hard and broke her jaw in more than one place.</p>
      <p>"As has been said, the result of that was that she has ended up with metal plates securing her jaw.</p>
      <p>"She still has a degree of anxiety and the result of all that is it's a serious case where you have caused serious harm."</p>
      <p>However, he said "with some element of reluctance" he accepted it was not a higher culpability case, meaning a lower starting point for sentence.</p>
      <p>Recorder Rigby said he also gave him "a little bit of credit" for his guilty plea "albeit at the very last moment", which showed "a degree of remorse".</p>
      <p>He jailed Farrell for 18 months and imposed a two-year restraining order, preventing him from contacting Miss McDonald.</p>
