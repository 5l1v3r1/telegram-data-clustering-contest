      <h1>Moise Kean blasts father after he said Everton transfer 'was a mistake'</h1>
      <h2>The summer signing from Juventus has struggled to settle in England and has yet to score for the Toffees after nine Premier League appearances</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T02:54:16+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 02:54</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>Moise Kean has criticised his own father after he made comments suggesting that his son's move to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> was an error.</p>
      <p>Kean joined the Toffees for a fee of around £27m from the Serie A champions in August but has so far not made the impact he would have liked, and is yet to get off the mark for his new team.</p>
      <p>Kean's father, Jean, recently spoke to Italian radio channel Centro Suono Sport and said: "Sending my son to England was a mistake, because he's still too young, he's not feeling good at Everton, I didn't like this transfer.</p>

      <p>"I hope he can come back to Italy as soon as possible, I hope he goes to Rome, but the important thing is that he comes back here."</p>
      <p>Kean has hit back at the comments, however, by posting on his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/moise_kean/?hl=en">Instagram</a> story a message in Italian which read: "Don't talk about my life when yours is not an example. I don't fear the hard times when the best comes (after) them."</p>
      <p>While Kean appears content to stay and fight for his place at Goodison Park, reports have suggested his agent, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/moise-kean-offered-ac-milan-20894641">Mino Raiola, has offered him to AC Milan</a> in order to end his Everton nightmare.</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen whether Kean is involved in the Toffee's next game against Norwich on Saturday after he was left out of the squad for the win against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> after allegedly turning up late for a team meeting.</p>

      <p>Jean also criticised Juventus in his extraordinary radio rant for allegedly refusing to pay him two tractors he was owed as part of the deal.</p>
      <p>"I believe in God and I believe in promises," he said. "But if their word was a lie I can’t trust them anymore. They promised me two tractors and they still haven’t been given to me.</p>
