      <p>(CN) – FBI agents arrested the mayor of Muncie, Indiana, on Monday on a charge of theft of government funds in a corruption probe of his administration that has lasted for nearly four years.</p>
      <p>Dennis Tyler, 76, is accused of accepting a $5,000 bribe for steering an excavation job to a local contractor. </p>
      <p>Tyler will wrap up an eight-year tenure as mayor at the end of the year.</p>
      <p>“My office intends to prosecute Tyler to the full extent of the law,” said U.S. Attorney Josh Minkler said at a press conference in Indianapolis hours after the arrest.</p>
      <p>The FBI investigation led to former Muncie building commissioner Craig Nichols being sent to federal prison for two years after he pleaded guilty to money laundering and wire fraud.</p>
      <p>Tyler’s indictment accuses him of accepting the money from Muncie sewer district official Tracy Barton.</p>
      <p>The FBI searched City Hall and the Muncie Sewer District over the summer. Tyler is the seventh person charged in the investigation.</p>
      <p>According to the Muncie Star-Press, Tyler faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.</p>
      <p>After appearing in an initial hearing in federal court in Indianapolis Monday, Tyler was released from federal custody. He is awaiting a Jan. 21 trial.</p>
      <p>Barton is set to stand trial in April on charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, witness tampering and falsification of documents in a federal investigation.</p>
      <p>Tyler, a Muncie native, served in the city’s fire department for 42 years. He was also an Indiana state legislator for six years before he was elected mayor.</p>
      <p>The Democrat will be succeeded by Republican Dan Ridenour, who won the mayoral race earlier this month.</p>
      <p>“While this has become a pattern in our community of late, I am pleased that two weeks ago voters overwhelmingly supported turning the page for a new day in Muncie,” Ridenour said.</p>
      <p>Tyler’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.</p>
