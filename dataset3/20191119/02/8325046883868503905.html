      <p>In a rare public appearance, Christine Blasey Ford, who accused US Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, said she felt it was her “duty as a citizen” to come forward.</p>
      <p>Ford, a psychology professor at Palo Alto University in California, accepted the ACLU of Southern California’s Roger Baldwin Courage Award on Sunday for speaking out against Kavanaugh.</p>
      <p>“When I came forward last September, I did not feel courageous,” she said during her acceptance speech. “I was simply doing my duty as a citizen. I understood that not everyone would welcome my information, and I was prepared for a variety of outcomes, including being dismissed.”</p>
      <p>She has made few public appearances since she went before the Senate in September 2018 to deliver an emotional testimony during Kavanaugh’s confirmation hearings when he was a nominee for the Supreme Court by President Donald Trump. She accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were teenagers.</p>
      <p>Kavanaugh denied Ford’s allegation, and he was narrowly confirmed to the court the following month.</p>
      <p>During Sunday’s speech, Ford detailed how much her life had changed after she publicly testified before Congress, including the added security measures her family had to take after much criticism and scrutiny.</p>
      <p>“I was prepared for a variety of outcomes, including being dismissed,” Ford said. “I was not prepared for the venom, the consistent attacks, the vilification, the loss of personal privacy, and the collateral damages to my friends and my family.</p>
      <p>“I was not prepared to be physically threatened, or forced out of our home for over three months. I have learned a lot over the past year. I have learned there’s a well-financed attack machine out there ready to flood the internet and the media anytime I raise my head. And I know it’s not going to go away.”</p>
      <p>Despite the fear that ensued after her testimony, Ford said she was also met with support that gave her the strength to overcome the criticism and threats.</p>
      <p>“Though I underestimated the pain, I also underestimated the love and the support that I have received,” she said.</p>
