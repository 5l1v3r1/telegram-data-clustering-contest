      <h1>Young people and mental health: ‘We’re not shocked by suicide anymore’</h1>
      <h2>Climate change and a relentless digital revolution are taking their toll on today’s youth</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T02:55:19+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 02:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishtimes.com/profile/carl-o-brien-7.1010688" target="_blank">Carl O'Brien</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Nathan+Henchy">Nathan Henchy</a> and his friends would like to say they’re surprised by the findings of the largest study to date on youth mental health problems – but they’re not.</p>
      <p>Life these days, they say, feels like there’s a background din of anxiety over political upheaval, climate change and a relentless digital revolution.</p>
      <p>They say they see the evidence of growing levels of anxiety and depression all around them, whether it’s panic attacks, academic pressure or even self-harm and suicide.</p>
      <p>“These days, we’re not shocked by suicide anymore,” says Henchy (18) from <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Tullamore">Tullamore</a>, Co Offaly. “Not necessarily our age, but young adults where we live . . . during the summer it was like nearly every week that so-and-so had died.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Nicole+Mannion">Nicole Mannion</a> (17), also from Tullamore, agrees.</p>
      <p>She feels younger generations may be more open about discussing mental health issues – but, in many cases, lack the resilience to cope with everyday pressures.</p>
      <p>“You also see how people get very easily stressed nowadays by things like schoolwork or tests . . . Even small tests, like the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Junior+Cert">Junior Cert</a>. ”</p>
      <p>“I see social anxiety problems and panic attacks a lot, it’s a very big problem in my area . . . it’s scary to see how bad it can get. You could walk into a bathroom and someone feels they can’t leave it.”</p>
      <p>Their feelings are echoed in a new study which captures the views of more than 19,000 young people on mental health and well-being.</p>
      <blockquote>While there has been a drop in levels of self-esteem, optimism and life satisfaction, those getting support from supportive adults in their lives has increased</blockquote>
      <p>It shows rates of anxiety and depression are on the rise among young people and that levels of self-harm are significant across the adolescent and young adult age groups, with two in every five young adults having self-harmed.</p>
      <p>On a more positive note, numbers of young people drinking alcohol, being bullied in school and stressing about finances have dropped.</p>
      <p>And while there has been a drop in levels of self-esteem, optimism and life satisfaction, those getting support from supportive adults in their lives has increased.</p>
      <h3>Prevalent</h3>
      <p>When it comes to whether these issues are actually more prevalent among this generation, or whether there is simply greater awareness, there are mixed views.</p>
      <p>But what they all agree on is that younger people are growing up in a far different world compared to previous generations.</p>
      <p>“I think we’re constantly connected to different online platforms, constantly on phones . . . we never switch off and are constantly connected,” says Dean Murray (20), a student from <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Ballymun">Ballymun</a>, Dublin.</p>
      <p>“Even in school, you see students walking down corridors in a group, but they’re not talking . . . they’re constantly on phones, so there’s that disconnect and they’re not listening to what’s happening around them.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Tomas+Griffin">Tomas Griffin</a> (17) from Tullamore agrees. “It’s much easier for young people to be anxious: we can see everything and access everything,” he says.</p>
      <p>“You can’t turn anywhere without finding out something new and awful about the world. You can either be upset and angry and afraid – or you can ignore it and feel awful for ignoring it,” he says.</p>
      <p>In their own lives, he says, it feels like there is always something to worry about just around the corner.</p>
      <p>“If we’re thinking about the Leaving Cert, it’s not just about getting the points, but it’s where will I live next year, will I get a job, will I be able to have kids, can I afford that . . . and then there’ s eco-anxiety. And there’s an attitude of, maybe things will be beyond saving in any case.”</p>
      <p>A bugbear for some is that this is a generation that has been encouraged to be more open about mental health issues.</p>
      <h3>‘Snowflakes’</h3>
      <p>Yet, when they voice their opinions, they are labelled “snowflakes” and told of how previous generations had it even tougher.</p>
      <p>“When you explain to older generations, it’s seen as just anxiety. Get over it,” says Mannion. “But you need to be affected to really explain how hard it is . . . they don’t fully understand what’s going on.”</p>
      <p>So, how can we help younger people to cope?</p>
      <p>Murray says using the education system to teach resilience and how to handle stress and anxiety is one good approach.</p>
      <blockquote>While young people might have access to career guidance in school, if they need professional mental health support it can involve a long journey to an impersonal clinical setting</blockquote>
      <p>Early intervention, support and prevention is key to help prevent problems boiling over into crises, says Henchy.</p>
      <p>Making supports such as the child and adolescent mental health services available in school is important, adds Mannion.</p>
      <p>She feels that while young people might have access to career guidance in school, if they need professional mental health support it can involve a long journey to an impersonal clinical setting during school hours.</p>
      <p>Parents will doubtless worry about the report’s findings. Should they feel alarmed about what kind of pressures are facing younger people?</p>
      <p>“Yes, parents should be worried – the report doesn’t lie,” says Griffin. “We’re past the point of putting positive spins on it.</p>
      <p>“There are problems with young people. They’ve been ignored this long. If we keep going, there will be a crisis . . . we’ve identified where the problems are – we’ve done everything we can do as young people.”</p>
