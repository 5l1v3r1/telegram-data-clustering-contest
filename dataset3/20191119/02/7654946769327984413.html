      <h1>Morgan North building finds major tenant for top floors</h1>

      <p>A major bet by Tishman Speyer just a few blocks south of its rising Spiral tower has already come up aces for the developer.</p>
      <p>Just a month after it closed on a deal to take control of the six top floors of the massive 1933 building known as Morgan North, it’s already signed a major office tenant — Dentsu Aegis Network. The lease negotiation was reported by <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/01/tishman-speyer-closes-on-lease-for-morgan-north-post-office/">The Post’s Lois Weiss in early October</a>. The 320,000-square-foot deal just closed and the company is expected to break the news to employees on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The tenant is a subsidiary of Tokyo-based advertising and public relations giant Dentsu. It plans to consolidate employees from four Manhattan locations, of which the largest are 32 Sixth Ave., 115 Broadway and 150 E. 42nd St. It had earlier checked out Vornado’s Farley Post Office project.</p>
      <p>In October, Tishman Speyer bought a 99-year lease on the building at 341 Ninth Ave. from the US Postal Service, which will continue to use the lower floors. The building spans the entire block bounded by Ninth and Tenth avenues and West 29th to 30th street.</p>
      <p>Dentsu Aegis Network will occupy half of 341 Ninth’s 200,000 square-foot sixth floor and all of floors seven through 10. It will have exclusive use of an eighth-floor terrace and a rooftop amenity space, and will also share access to a 2.5-acre roof deck on the seventh floor.</p>
      <p>The new lease eats up about half of Tishman Speyer’s total 630,000 square feet of “creative offices” at the location. Tishman Speyer president/CEO Rob Speyer said that when he finalized the commitment to redevelop Morgan North last month, “We saw it as an ideal fit for companies like Dentsu Aegis powered by creative people and their innovative ideas.”</p>
      <p>Dentsu Aegis Network America CEO Nick Brien said, “We have been searching for some time for the ideal location to bring us all together under one roof. We’re excited to have found this semi-industrial building which allows for our 24 leading agencies to operate in a more fluid and dynamic environment.’”</p>
      <p>Cushman &amp; Wakefield’s Richard Bernstein, Adam Ardise and Jared Thal represented the tenant while Tishman Speyer worked the deal in-house. Sources told Realty Check that asking rents are in the $120s per square foot.</p>
