      <h1>Amur tiger at Calgary Zoo put down due to ovarian cancer and health complications</h1>

      <p>A female tiger at the Calgary Zoo has been euthanized due to ovarian cancer and related health complications, according to zoo officials.</p>
      <p>Alarms were raised when the zoo’s animal care team noticed a change in the tiger’s behaviour over the past several days. The 19-year-old Amur tiger’s activity level and appetite dropped and, after she was examined under anesthesia Monday evening, the care team determined her poor health would severely affect her quality of life, according to a news release from the zoo.</p>
      <p>“The difficult decision was made to humanely euthanize Katja,” the Zoo’s statement read.</p>

      <p>A necropsy performed Tuesday showed Katja had been living with ovarian cancer and related health issues. The loss of an Amur tiger is significant because the species is critically endangered in the wild.</p>
      <p>Katja, a mother of three tigers, lived at the Calgary Zoo since she was born April 20, 2000. Her three cubs were entered into the Association of Zoos and Aquariums’ species survival program and helped in introducing a “precious gene diversity” into the wild.</p>
      <p>“The zookeepers and veterinary team that were privileged to care for Katja are devastated by the loss of this playful tiger who was always keen to interact with her human caregivers and participate in her daily training sessions,” said the zoo.</p>
