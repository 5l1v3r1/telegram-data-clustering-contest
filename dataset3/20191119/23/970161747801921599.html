        <b>Not to burst anyone’s bubble but Celine Dion never wanted to record the Titanic hit My Heart Will Go On.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Thankfully, her husband and manager at the time, Rene Angelil, convinced her to do the song and we are so glad he did.</p>
      <p>Making an appearance on Watch What Happens Live, the superstar confessed: ‘It didn’t appeal to me. I was probably very tired that day – very tired.</p>
      <p>‘My husband said, “Let’s hold on.” He talked to the writer and he said, “Let’s try to make it, like, a little demo.”’</p>

      <p>What song would they have used in 1998 instead? Brandy and Monica’s The Boy Is Mine?</p>
      <p>In true Celine fashion, the singer only needed one take to sing the song which then went on to sell 18 million physical copies.</p>
      <p>Celine said: ‘I sang the song once and they built the orchestra around it. I never re-sang it for the recording. So the demo is the actual recording.</p>

      <p>‘But after that, I’ve sang it about 3 gazillion times.’</p>
      <p>My Heart Will Go On also won the 1998 Academy Award for Best Original song and also won Record of the year, Song of the Year, Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture at the 1999 Grammy Awards.</p>
      <p>Recently <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/celine-dion-recalls-final-words-she-told-husband-rene-angelil-just-before-he-died-of-throat-cancer-i-got-this-11149023/">Celine opened up about the death of her husband Rene</a> on Good Morning Britain, after he died of throat cancer in 2016.</p>
      <p>The singer recalled her final moments with her beloved husband as she told him: ‘I got this.’</p>
      <p>Celine also explained how her new album was the first English album she has released without him by her side.</p>
      <p>She revealed: ‘It took a while to record the album. It was a process.</p>
      <p>‘Losing a half of you, because we were partners, we were one. This is actually my first English album without him by my side, so that was emotional. At the same time something that was telling me that, “You know, it’s ok.”’</p>
