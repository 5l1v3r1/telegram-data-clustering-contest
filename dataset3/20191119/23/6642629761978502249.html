      <p>A 17th-century copy of Leonardo da Vinci's "Mona Lisa" was sold on Tuesday at Sotheby's auction house in Paris for 552,500 euros ($611,950), much more than the initial valuation of 70,000-90,000 euros ($77,545 - $99,700).</p>
      <p>The Mona Lisa itself, on which da Vinci began work in 1503, has hung at the Louvre Museum in Paris for more than 200 years. It is thought to depict Lisa Gherardini, the wife of a Florentine silk merchant, Francesco Giocondo.</p>
