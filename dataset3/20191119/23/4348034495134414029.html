      <p>The late Phife Dawg would have turned 49 years old tomorrow (November 20). Sadly, Malik Taylor passed away <a href="https://ambrosiaforheads.com/2016/03/phife-dawg-from-a-tribe-called-quest-passes-away-at-age-45/">more than three-and-a-half years ago</a>. The MC/producer was not able to see the final album from A Tribe Called Quest, 2016’s <a href="https://ambrosiaforheads.com/2016/11/a-tribe-called-quest-we-got-it-from-here-full-album-audio/"><i>We Got It from Here… Thank You 4 Your Service</i></a>. However, he worked on the release that reunited the group in the studio, unbeknownst to fans at the time.</p>
      <p>Consequence was one of A Tribe Called Quest’s closest affiliates. He played a breakthrough role in 1996’s <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0EguP4tsJurU5I8ocCxdyb?si=Bu5MpegSQbGv_fdDGTPbkw"><i>Beats, Rhymes &amp; Life</i></a> (after some previous vinyl-only work with Tribe) and appeared on the group’s following two LPs, including <i>We Got It from Here… </i>Even when Cons was an artist on Kanye West’s G.O.O.D Music imprint, he often appeared in live shows from Tribe. Although the Queens, New Yorker is cousins with Q-Tip, he also had a special bond with the 5-Foot Assassin.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The groovy, R&amp;B-tinged song represents for Linden Boulevard and the Q borough. “<i>Home is where your heart is,</i>” echoes the chorus. ItsTheCons raps about homecomings after his award tours, and why the faces in his neighborhood make it a home. In one of his final verses, Phife raps about why he too, loved Queens, even while establishing residences in California and Georgia. He shouts out his St. Albans section and points out the rich Hip-Hop history in the borough. Cons adds to the track to point out its significance, and how he misses Phife.</p>

      <p>“Phife [Dawg] and I worked on ‘No Place Like Home’ in the same time frame as the beginning stages of [<i>We Got It from</i> Here…]. Even though he was living in the Bay during the last years of his life, we kept in touch frequently and I even brought my son, Caiden, to meet him in person while he was in New York; which lead to both of us making a cameo appearance in his last solo video.”</p>
