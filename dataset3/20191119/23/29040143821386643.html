      <p><b>Best answer:</b> Yes, you can watch Disney Plus (Disney+) on your computer through a browser like Chrome, Internet Explorer, and Safari. You can also use your browser to cast to something like a Chromecast.</p>

        <li>In a galaxy not so far away: <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fdisneyplus.bn5x.net%2Fc%2F159229%2F705874%2F9358%3FsubId1%3DUUacUdUnU81844YYm%26subId2%3Ddac%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fpreview.disneyplus.com%252F&amp;token=WwLBa3Bw">Disney+</a> (From $7/mo at Disney+)</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Waves of Disney are upon us</h3>
      <p>Disney+ is finally here, and for years Disney content has been spread across various streaming services; even then, everything wasn't out there. There was what DIsney called the Disney Vault, which is where it would put movies for some time, then bring them out for a while and then put them back.</p>
      <p>Thankfully with Disney+ much of that is going away, and we now get access to what we love via streaming. While there is way more available now than there ever has been before, everything isn't going to be available right away. Disney+ will have hundreds of <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-movies-does-Disney-plus-have?_ga=2.78483092.1268950509.1571239748-1001684937.1561405340">movies</a> and <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/what-tv-shows-does-disney-plus-have?_ga=2.78483092.1268950509.1571239748-1001684937.1561405340">TV shows</a> available ranging from decades-old classics to recent releases like Moana. The goal is to have at least 500 movies and 7,500 episodes of TV available to stream through Disney+ by the end of 2019. There are even going to be some new original series and films that will be exclusive to Disney+, such as the live-action Lady and the Tramp.</p>
      <p>Original movies and television series that will be exclusive to Disney+ like Noelle, Dolphin Reef, Stargirl, Loki, and many more. There will also be plenty of Disney characters like Mickey and Goofy, Woody and Buzz, and most of the other classics. That's not to mention the offerings from Marvel, Star Wars, 20th Century Fox, and National Geographic.</p>

      <p>While the number of devices that have direct access to Disney+ via an app is a relatively comprehensive one, sometimes you just want to use a good ol' fashioned computer. While there isn't a <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/disney-needs-release-its-app-windows10">UWP app for Windows</a> yet and Mac computers haven't gotten a dedicated app either, desktop browsers will be able to stream Disney+. Now that the service is live, Disney has provided us a comprehensive list of browsers and requirements:</p>
      <h4>Windows</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Chrome 73+ is supported on Windows 7 and later</li>
