      <h1>Tottenham Hotspur Supporters' Trust release statement on Mauricio Pochettino sacking</h1>
      <h2>The Argentinean manager was fired by Tottenham on Tuesday evening following a poor run of form which has seen Spurs win just once in their last five Premier League games</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T23:48:26+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 23:48</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>Tottenham Hotspur Supporters' Trust said it was "shocked and saddened" by the club's decision to sack their manager Mauricio Pochettino on Tuesday evening.</p>
      <p>The Argentinean manager was relieved of his duties following a poor start to the season, with former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> manager Jose Mourinho expected to replace him.</p>
      <p>Pochettino has been a popular figure at Spurs since his appointment in 2014, taking the club to the Champions League final last season before eventually losing 2-0 to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a>.</p>
      <p>But chairman Daniel Levy said in a statement: "We were extremely reluctant to make this change and it is not a decision the Board has taken lightly, nor in haste.</p>

      <p>“Regrettably domestic results at the end of last season and beginning of this season have been extremely disappointing.</p>
      <p>In a following statement, THST said: "We're shocked and saddened to hear our club has sacked Mauricio Pochettino and his coaching staff.</p>
      <p>"We question why this decision was taken at the end, rather than the beginning, of the international break. We question whether the timing of the decision leaves the club with much choice in who takes over."</p>
      <p>Mourinho could be announced as Spurs' new manager within 24 hours, a decision which is likely to split opinion amongst their fanbase.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> defender Toby Alderweireld said the news of Pochettino's sacking was a shock to him.</p>

      <p>"It's a surprise for me as well," he told Sky Sports after Belgium's Euro 2020 qualifying win over Cyprus.</p>
      <p> "I think the club made a decision and we have to accept this. I think we have to be very thankful to him, for what he achieved, he brought this club to the next level."</p>
      <p>The centre-back said he expected Spurs to bring in a "big manager" to replace Pochettino.</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen whether Spurs appoint a new manager before their next game, which is a London derby against rivals <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> on Saturday.</p>
