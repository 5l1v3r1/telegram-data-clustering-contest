      <h2>The decision to sack <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mauricio-pochettino/"><b>Mauricio Pochettino</b></a> may reportedly cost <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/spurs/"><b>Tottenham Hotspur</b></a> in the region of £19m.</h2>

      <p>After a poor start to this season's Premier League, chairman <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/daniel-levy/"><b>Daniel Levy</b></a> has opted to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/spurs/sack-race/news/spurs-part-ways-with-mauricio-pochettino_379916.html">end Pochettino's five-and-a-half year stay</a> at the north London outfit.</p>
      <p>However, according to <i>The Mirror</i>, parting ways with the Argentine will lead to Levy having to shell out £19m in compensation.</p>
      <p>While Pochettino stands to receive approximately £12.5m, members of his backroom staff will also be paid lucrative sums due to holding long-term contracts at the club.</p>
      <p>Spurs are allegedly in talks with former Chelsea and Manchester United boss <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jose-mourinho/"><b>Jose Mourinho</b></a>, who is said to be regarded as <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/spurs/news/mourinho-a-strong-contender-for-spurs-job_379938.html">'a strong contender' for the vacant position.</a></p>
