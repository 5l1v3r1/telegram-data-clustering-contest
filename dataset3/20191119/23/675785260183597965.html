      <h1>Jamie Carragher makes Jose Mourinho to Tottenham declaration</h1>
      <h2>Jose Mourinho is the red-hot favourite to be named as Mauricio Pochettino's successor following the Argentine's sacking on Tuesday night</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T23:25:05+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 23:25</time> by <a rel="author">Jacob Murtagh, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jacob-murtagh/</a></address>
      <p>Jamie Carragher reckons Jose Mourinho is just the type of manager <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> need to replace Mauricio Pochettino.</p>
      <p>However, the Sky Sports pundit hopes the self-styled Special One stays in the studio rather than return to the dugout.</p>
      <p>Mourinho is open to the prospect of returning to Premier League management with Spurs, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/daniel-levy-ready-explore-jose-20918034">as revealed by Mirror Sport.</a></p>
      <p>But when asked whether Mourinho could take over the struggling north Londoners, Carragher replied: “Well I hope not because then he’d be out of our studio then!</p>
      <p>“There might be a bit of room for me then on Super Sunday, I can’t get in the Super Sunday studio at the moment with Jose and all that, there might be a bit of room for me, squad rotation.</p>

      <p>“But no I hope it’s not Jose to be honest, I think he’s been great on Sky and I’ve enjoyed listening to him, so fingers crossed it’s not him.”</p>
      <p>Pochettino departs with Tottenham 11 points off the pace in a race for a top-four spot.</p>
      <p>And <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> legend Carragher believes Mourinho has the experience to help change their fortunes.</p>

      <p>He told Sky Sports News: “But as I said if Jose wants to get back into top-level management, you look at his C.V., people question the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> job, but you have to look at his career as a whole.</p>
      <p>“He’s been hugely successful and that is the one thing Tottenham lack at this moment, no matter how well Pochettino’s done.</p>
      <p>“They haven’t quite got over the line in getting a trophy and normally that’s what Jose Mourinho does when he goes to a club.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Dele Alli has paid tribute to Pochettino following Tottenham’s decision to wield the axe on the Argentine.</p>
      <p>All was quick to praise the departing the man who handed him his debut as a teenager after Daniel Levy decided to show him the door.</p>
      <p>He wrote: “I can’t thank this man enough. He’s taught me so much and I’m so grateful for everything he’s done for me.</p>
      <p>“Good luck and hope to see you again my friend.”</p>
