      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/ben-askren">Ben Askren</a> shocked the MMA world yesterday when he announced his retirement from the sport during his appearance on Ariel Helwani's MMA Show.</p>
      <p>Reactions to his unforeseen retirement poured in from all quarters of the MMA fraternity and <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/chris-weidman">Chris Weidman</a> was one of the many fighters who took to Twitter to show some love to Askren.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/ufc">UFC</a> Middleweight Champion revealed Askren had a big influence on his career as they both come from grappling backgrounds.</p>
      <p>Askren has been an inspiration to Weidman, who has learned a lot from the former Bellator Champion's unique approach to fighting.</p>
      <p>Weidman also reminisced his high school days when he wrestled Askren.</p>
      <p>Here's what Weidman wrote in his tweet:</p>
      <blockquote>“Congrats @Benaskren on an amazing career! You were a huge inspiration to me and many more. From wrestling you in high school when I was very young to watching you throughout your wrestling and MMA careers.I learned a lot from your unique techniques as well as your mindset #funky”.</blockquote>

      <p>Askren <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/mma/ufc-news-ben-askren-reveals-how-he-wanted-his-career-to-end">may not have had a storybook UFC career</a> but the former ONE FC Champion still managed to captivate the imaginations of the UFC faithful during his short stint with the promotion.</p>
      <p>Ben Askren retires from the sport of MMA with an 18-2 record, with both his losses coming in the UFC. While he may be done as an active competitor, Askren still has a lot to offer to the sport of MMA as a wrestling coach and we'll surely be seeing him around quite often.</p>
