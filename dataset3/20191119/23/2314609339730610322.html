      <h1>Tories slammed for 'fake fact check' election debate tactic</h1>

      <p><b>London:</b> Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn have fought an entertaining but inconclusive first election debate, with both candidates’ strengths and weaknesses on display.</p>

      <p>But the biggest controversy unfolded off-screen as the Conservative Party temporarily redesigned its Twitter account, apparently to pass itself off as an independent fact-checking service.</p>
      <p>The latest polls have Johnson’s Conservatives heading for a comfortable majority, and the Prime Minister was eager to hammer ad nauseam his popular message that his was the only major party committed to the UK leaving the EU by the end of January.</p>
      <p>“The way to restore trust in politics is to get Brexit done and to move forward,” Johnson said, accusing his opponent of standing for more “dither and delay”.</p>
      <p>But the Opposition Leader, who came into the debate in need of new momentum, would have been satisfied with a snap poll of viewers that scored it a dead heat.</p>

      <p>While he repeatedly refused, under pressure, to say whether he actually wants Brexit to happen, Corbyn scored a number of hits on his occasionally angry and flustered opponent.</p>
      <p>Accused of likely forming a “chaotic coalition” with the Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon, Corbyn won applause with his retort that there had been “nine years of chaotic coalition already” under the Conservatives.</p>
      <p>And he pinned down Johnson on his claim that Brexit would be over by January, saying the Prime Minister’s course would see him bogged down for years negotiating trade deals with the US and EU.</p>
      <p>“You’re not going to get it done in a few months and you know that perfectly well,” he said.</p>

      <p>The debate confirmed, again, that the Conservatives have abandoned the levels of fiscal restraint of previous administrations in a bald push for the popular centre.</p>
      <p>“I believe in spending, investing massively in our public services,” Johnson said at one point.</p>
      <p>But he painted Labour’s plans, for even higher new spending levels, as irresponsible, saying they had discovered a “forest” of magic money trees.</p>
      <p>Corbyn attacked Johnson over claims that his post-Brexit trade deals would expose the National Health Service to new competition and privatisation. He brandished an “NHS dossier” obtained through Freedom of Information which he said exposed Tory plans to give “full market access” to American drug companies in the UK.</p>

      <p>But Johnson retorted that Labour’s plans for a four-day working week would particularly hurt the understaffed NHS.</p>
      <p>Corbyn also found himself on the back foot over anti-Semitism within his party, with his claims to have dealt with the problem falling flat with the ITV studio audience.</p>
      <p>Asked what they would give each other for Christmas, Corbyn said he would give Johnson a copy of Dickens’ <i>A Christmas Carol</i> while Johnson first suggested a copy of his Brexit deal but settled on Damson jam, which Corbyn appeared to be delighted with.</p>
      <p>The Labour leader concluded the encounter by asking the public to “vote for hope” while Johnson reiterated the need to avoid a Brexit “Groundhog Day” under Labour.</p>

      <p>Shortly before the debate the Conservative party changed their press office Twitter account’s name to “factcheckUK” and redesigned it to disguise its political origin.</p>
      <p>Twitter, which polices deceptive behaviour by verified “blue tick” accounts told the BBC it was looking into the tactic.</p>
      <p>James Cleverly, Tory Party chairman, told Sky News it was "absolutely clear it is a Conservative Party website".</p>
      <p>But fact-checking agency FullFact said it was "inappropriate and misleading".</p>
      <p>The Tories fell foul of social media earlier in the campaign when they tweeted a doctored video.</p>
