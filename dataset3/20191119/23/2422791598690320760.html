      <p>EDMONTON -- Days after addressing Don Cherry's dismissal during a "Hockey Night in Canada" broadcast, sports broadcaster Ron MacLean said that he doesn't believe his former co-host is racist.</p>
      <p>MacLean, the long-time co-host of "Coach's Corner" with Cherry, was in Edmonton Tuesday to receive an honorary doctor of laws degree at the University of Alberta.</p>
      <p>Before receiving the degree, MacLean was asked by a reporter whether he thinks Cherry is racist.</p>
      <p>"What I know is that we made the mistake ... I mean, no," he said. "Don, I think, has started to come around ... he knows we projected an idea, an attitude or a behaviour on someone. He knows, I feel like in what I've listened to, he's trying now to admit to that.</p>
      <p>"If I have one regret, it's that when I apologized on the Sunday night, I used Don's name and, if I am sitting at home watching it, that would hurt me. That might have created some resolve in Don not to apologize."</p>
      <p>Sportsnet fired Cherry on Nov. 11, two days after controversial on-air comments during "Coach's Corner."</p>
      <p>The 85-year-old broadcaster made remarks that many felt were critical of immigrants for not wearing Remembrance Day poppies.</p>
      <p>Cherry used the phrase, "You people," during the segment but later denied that he was singling out visible minorities.</p>
      <p>"You people that come here, whatever it is, you love our way of life, you love our milk and honey, at least you can pay a couple bucks for a poppy or something like that," Cherry said on the segment. "These guys paid for your way of life that you enjoy in Canada, these guys paid the biggest price."</p>
      <p>In Saturday's address, MacLean said "Coach's Corner" is no more.</p>
      <p>"We are all hurting. I have collapsed 100 times this week, if not more," he said during the broadcast. "We are all disappointed."</p>
      <p>MacLean said that he has received an email from Cherry since he spoke out Saturday.</p>
      <p>"He's upset, but we're all raw," MacLean said Tuesday in Edmonton. "As I said on the TV, I love Don. It doesn't sound like I would be there for Don, but I am.</p>
      <p>"We're just going through one of the most difficult situations because, as I said, we each made our personal decisions."</p>
      <p>MacLean said he will carry on with Sportsnet.</p>
      <p>"I can't back down from the difficulty, I was very keen to apologize, I felt very much the need to continue to represent the show," he said. "We all love hockey, we love Don, we love hockey, we love the bridge-building aspects of our game. We're caught in a situation -- it needed to be addressed."</p>
      <p>In his address to U of A graduates, MacLean used the controversy as a teaching moment.</p>
      <p>"My job is to teach you kids -- you young women and men -- how to stay out of trouble," he said. "This ought to be good."</p>
      <p>MacLean, who grew up in Red Deer, Alta., said he's struggled to find words in the past 10 days.</p>
      <p>"I've looked to certain people to influence my opinions," he said. "This week, I've talked to First Nations chiefs, people of colour, women.</p>
      <p>"While you think for yourself ... please listen to your friends, please listen to others and it will help to imbue you going forward."</p>
      <p>Other honorary degree recipients during this fall's convocation ceremonies include minority language rights advocate Claudette Tardif and award-winning poet Alice Major.</p>
