        <b>"The first thing he thinks about is Wales, then golf and after that, Real Madrid."</b>

      <p><a href="https://en.as.com/en/2019/11/16/football/1573933417_690571.html">Gareth Bale has been criticised in Spain</a> for prioritising playing for Wales - and finding time for a quick 18 holes - over turning out for his club Real Madrid, and the forward certainly enjoyed himself after helping his country to the finals of Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>Bale set up Aaron Ramsey's opener against Hungary and excelled throughout as <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50384127">Wales reached their third major tournament.</a></p>
      <p>The 30-year-old has not played for Real since 5 October and his return to international duty was dubbed by the Spanish media as the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50378786">'Miracle in Wales'</a> this week.</p>

      <p>Wales fans have turned the mantra 'Wales. Golf. Madrid' into a chant, with Bale <a href="https://twitter.com/sgorio/status/1196474490705862656">himself admitting</a> he found the song amusing.</p>
      <p>And after securing qualification Bale was front and central as the squad paraded a banner echoing that sentiment.</p>

        <figcaption>Spanish newspaper Marca ran a poll which at 23:30 GMT on Tuesday saw 75% of respondents label Bale's celebration as showing 'a lack of respect for the club and fans'</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>When asked about the sarcasm aimed at him in Spain as he previewed the game, Bale said: "I've heard some stories but I don't really take notice.</p>
      <p>"My friends tend to send me some funny pictures or whatever they write.</p>

        <figcaption>Spanish newspapers have taken a sarcastic tone in their coverage of Wales and Real Madrid forward Gareth Bale</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>"I find it hilarious to be honest, especially some of the pictures and stuff my friends send me. On one, it said 'triple bogey' and I've never had a triple bogey! At least give me an albatross! It's funny.</p>
      <p>"Maybe to them [the Spanish media] it doesn't look great but it's just a kind of coincidence that the national team comes around this week and I've returned to full training.</p>
      <p>"If I'm fit, no matter where I am, I'm going to try to play, whether it be for Wales or Madrid. For me it was a no-brainer: if I'm fit to play then I'll give it my all."</p>
