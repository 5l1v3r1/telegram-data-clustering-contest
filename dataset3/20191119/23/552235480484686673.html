      <p>Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson slugged it out over independence in the crunch TV debate that could decide the future of the UK.</p>
      <p>IndyRef2 was the centre of clashes between the two men who could be Prime Minister in three weeks’ time.</p>
      <p>The Tory PM once again accused the Labour leader of being prepared to enter a “coalition of chaos” with Nicola Sturgeon to get to No10 with SNP backing in exchange for a second independence vote next year.</p>
      <p>Johnson said: “Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour Party, be in no doubt about it, in order to secure the keys to No10, are going to do a deal, or probably have done a deal, with Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP to form a Corbyn-Sturgeon coalition. And the price of that deal would be a second referendum on the Union.”</p>
      <p>But Corbyn snapped back at the Tory leader: “Nonsense”, adding: “Coalition of chaos? We’ve had that for the last nine years.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He added: “There’s not going to be a coalition between Labour and anybody else. There are no deals that have been done and there will be no deals that are done.”</p>
      <p>Pressed to rule out IndyRef2 before the end of the first year of a Labour government, Corbyn said: “I’ve said there would be no deal with the SNP, there would be no support for a Scottish referendum in the early years of the next Labour government because I want to invest in Scotland and give it the £70billion it needs in investment.”</p>
      <p>He said it was “their choice” if the SNP leadership “chooses to put the Tory government back in office”.</p>
      <p>Johnson shot back: “I listened very carefully to Mr Corbyn. I didn’t hear him say he was going to rule out a referendum on Scotland. Did you?”</p>
      <p>With both men scoring glancing blows on Scotland in the opening clashes of the hour-long tv debate, Johnson was emphatic that the Union was more important than Brexit, even though his Brexit deal creates different trading rules for Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>He said: “The Union is the most important thing. It’s a fantastic thing.”</p>
      <p>On the Union, Corbyn said he “hoped” the UK would stay together, leading to rivals piling in to criticise him afterwards. He added: “Our country is obviously very important and we have to bring this business to a close, and that’s why we’re proposing a trade deal with Europe or staying in, one or the other, as a way of bringing this issue to a close.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>On Brexit, Johnson tried to exploit Corbyn’s stance on whether he would back or vote against a Brexit deal he‘d negotiate with the EU.</p>
      <p>But Corbyn dismissed Johnson’s pledge to “get Brexit done” by the end of January as “nonsense”.</p>
      <p>Johnson said: “As soon as we can get that deal through Parliament, we can get on with people’s priorities.”</p>
      <p>But Corbyn hit back: “The idea Johnson’s deal can be dealt with and finished by the end of January is such nonsense.</p>
      <p>“What he is proposing is a trade deal which will take at least seven years to negotiate while at the same time saying he will negotiate a special trade deal with the EU. The two things are incompatible.”</p>
      <p>The audience displayed contempt for both leaders. They sniggered at Corbyn’s stance on Brexit but laughed at Johnson when it came to questions on trust and integrity.</p>
      <p>Corbyn was at home and winning applause when he spoke about the NHS and austerity, driving home his attack with a personal story about a friend who died of cancer this week.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>There was an awkward moment when host Julie Etchingham asked the PM and Corbyn to “make a gesture” towards each other and shake hands before the ad break.</p>
      <p>Corbyn later responded well to questions on anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, saying: “Anti-Semitism is an absolute evil and scourge within our society. I have taken action in my party where anyone who has committed any anti-Semitic acts or made any anti-Semitic statements, they are either suspended or expelled from the party.”</p>
      <p>Corbyn got the tone right for the audience on the monarchy, saying: “It needs improvement.” And on the question of what he’d give Johnson for Christmas, he said he’d buy Johnson a copy of A Christmas Carol so the PM could see “what Scrooge was really like”.</p>
      <p>But Corbyn needed a break-out moment and it did not come.</p>
