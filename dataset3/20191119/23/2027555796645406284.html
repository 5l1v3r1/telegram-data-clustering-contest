      <h1>Flood victims stare at bleak future</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T23:10:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 23:10</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/adithya-k" target="_blank">Adithya K A</a></address>
      <p>While the ministers are busy with the by-elections, the flood-affected victims staying at the relief centre have been shedding tears over their uncertain future.</p>
      <p>As many as 100 days have passed and the victims are literally on the streets with no hope of their miseries coming to end.</p>
      <p>There is not even a flicker of hope that good days are ahead for the 170 flood victims from 58 families at the relief centre opened at the Public School in Nelyahudikeri near Siddapura.</p>
      <p>The condition at the centre is pathetic as it lacks proper facilities. Earlier, a cook was engaged to prepare food for the flood victims. Now, the victims themselves are preparing food in shifts.</p>
      <p>To add salt to the injury, officials issued instructions to the flood victims to vacate the relief centre and blamed them for creating a din which was hindering the study of students in the school.</p>
      <p>The bitter winter has caused much suffering to the children and elderly people. The health of many women at the shelter had worsened.</p>
      <p>A victim who relocated to the relief centre said rented houses suiting the requirement of flood-affected families was not available in the region.</p>
      <p>“Some people had shifted to the rented houses and had paid deposits by availing loans. Now, they are in deep trouble, as rental allowance had not reached beneficiaries,” he charged.</p>
      <p>“A promise to build sheds made by the government is not fulfilled so far,” a victim rued.</p>
      <p>Labour union leader Bharat pointed out that the district administration had promised to release a rental allowance of Rs 5,000. But, it is yet to reach the needy.</p>
      <p>A programme on providing Rs 10,000 to each of the 58 affected families in Siddapura Panchayat limits for purchasing necessary equipment was not implemented effectively.</p>
      <p>Nearly 10 acres of land encroached in Bettadakadu village was cleared by the administration to rehabilitate the flood victims. But, the encroachers had the last laugh by bringing a stay from the court.</p>
      <p>“Thus, permanent rehabilitation of flood victims is a mirage in the present situation,” Bharat said.</p>
      <p>He urged the government to release Rs 10 lakh to each of the families which had lost houses.</p>
      <p>Bharat said the ‘Nirashritara Niveshana Horata Samiti’ will conduct another round of protest.</p>
      <p>Another victim, Safiya, said the memorandum submitted to district administration had not received any response.</p>
      <p>“Monsoons will soon set in. And without a roof and work, our dream to provide good education to our children is not likely to be realised,” she said as tears rolled down her cheeks.</p>
