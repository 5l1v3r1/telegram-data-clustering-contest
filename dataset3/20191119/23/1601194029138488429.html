      <p>Gareth Bale risked incurring the wrath of Real Madrid with his celebration of Wales' Euro 2020 qualification.</p>
      <p>Wales – semi-finalists at Euro 2016 – booked their ticket to next year's European Championship with a 2-0 win over Hungary on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Aaron Ramsey's double in Cardiff ensured Wales leapfrogged Hungary and clinched the second automatic qualifying spot in Group E.</p>
      <p>Bale and his team-mates celebratedly wildly post-game, with the former Tottenham talisman particularly catching the eye.</p>

      <p>Tipped to leave Madrid and criticised for his priorities amid his love for golf, Wales fans have adopted the chant, "Wales, golf, Madrid", which has been heard during the international break.</p>
      <p>And on Tuesday, Bale was seen celebrating in front of a Wales flag with the words: "WALES. GOLF. MADRID... IN THAT ORDER".</p>
