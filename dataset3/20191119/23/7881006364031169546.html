      <p><b>CHENNAI: </b>Tamil film superstar Rajinikanth has expressed that he will work with Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) founder and actor Kamal Haasan, if the situation arises, for the welfare of the people of Tamil Nadu.</p>
      <p>“If the situation arises, then I will join hands with Kamal and work for the welfare of the people of Tamil Nadu,” Rajinikanth said before leaving for Goa on Tuesday night. The veteran actor was responding to Kamal's offer, during a brief interaction with reporters at the airport here.</p>

      <p>On Tuesday, Kamal conveyed his desire to "journey” with Rajinikanth for the welfare of the people of Tami Nadu. Haasan told reporters at the airport here when asked if he has any plans to stitch up an alliance with Rajini, “I don’t mind coming together with ‘Thalaiava’ for the welfare of Tamil Nadu’s people.”</p>
      <p> Despite both the ‘stars’ taking different views on various social issues, Kamal Haasan has never shied away from hinting that he might be open to joining hands with Rajinikanth.  However, the latter had remained non-committal on this subject so far.</p>
      <p>At one juncture, Haasan had said Rajini's 'saffron' politics could be a hurdle in stitching up a potential alliance with him. Recently, Rajinikanth clarified that "he is being painted in saffron colour just like it happened with Tamil poet Tiruvalluvar."</p>
      <p> While backing Rajini's comments on Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami which have drawn criticism from the ruling AIADMK, Haasan said he would "journey together" with his contemporary for Tamil Nadu's welfare. However, Kamal did not give any indication of the two aligning politically.</p>
      <p> On Sunday while lavishly praising Kamal — his friend for about 43 years — Rajini kicked up a storm when he remarked Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami would not have dreamt of becoming Chief Minister and referred to the great luck that had catapulted Mr. Palaniswami.</p>
