      <p>Don’t miss your opportunity to be part of history!</p>
      <p>Gold Coasters are being encouraged by We Are Gold Coast and Groundwater Country Music Festival to hit the beach and create a sand angel this Friday to help the city beat a world record.</p>
      <p>On  November 22, the Gold Coast will set out to break the world record for <i>Most People Making Sand Angels Simultaneously</i>.</p>
      <p>“You’ve gotta be flat on the beach, and you’ve got to wave your arms and legs as if you’re flying like an angel for 30 seconds,” Mayor Tom Tate told Flan, Emily Jade and Christo from 1029 Hot Tomato.</p>
      <p>The current record of 1,387 sand angels is held by Michigan, USA, and they don’t even have a stunning ocean beach front like ours.</p>
      <p>Locals of all ages are encouraged to get down to Kurrawa Beach at 6am for registration, with the record attempt scheduled to take place at 6.40am.</p>
      <p>The event is also a chance to raise funds for Aussie farmers and rural communities in need, with gold coin donations on the day to support <a href="https://www.droughtangels.org.au/">Drought Angels</a>.</p>
      <p>“Gold Coasters are such generous people, they are always looking to help,” said Mayor Tate.</p>
      <p>“Please come on down at 6am, we’ll be on the sand flapping by 6.40!”</p>
      <p>“Bring the whole family and make it a family affair. Not just the kids, get out there. It doesn’t matter how old you are, you can still be an angel.”</p>
      <p>Kick off the festive season with a summer twist – sand angels style! For all the details of the event, visit: <a href="http://www.facebook.com/events/1568999299907652/">www.facebook.com/events/1568999299907652/</a></p>
