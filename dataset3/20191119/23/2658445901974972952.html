      <p>GeroCare, a subscription-based healthcare service for the elderly, was among the top 10 startups handpicked as Best of Ecosystem from each of the major capitals on the continent.</p>
      <p>This was announced during the just-concluded AfricArena Summit held in South Africa.</p>

      <p>GeroCare provides affordable, easily accessible and regular checkups by physicians. The idea was born out of the need for people show love and care from anywhere they may be in the world to their parents in Nigeria.</p>
      <p>According to a statement, the startups were selected during the AfricArena Tour – a crucial element of the Summit.</p>
      <p>Over a seven-month period, the AfricArena team embarked on a tour of the 10 leading tech hubs on the continent to find the most promising tech-based startups in these areas.</p>
      <p>The statement said the third annual AfricArena Summit kicked off Cape Town Tech Week with two days of intensive pitching from over 100 of the best African and African-focused tech startups and innovators from over 20 countries. The summit was also a destination for inspiration where seasoned entrepreneurs such as Vusi Thembekwayo and venture capitalists like the founders of Breega Capital shared their experiences and thoughts with attendees wanting to enrich their knowledge.</p>

      <p>Of this year’s winning startups, AfricArena Founder, Christophe Viarnaud said: “Entrepreneurs are Africa’s number one asset and the more than 100 startups that attended the Summit this year are amongst the very best innovators on the continent, and demonstrated their desire to create innovation not only to resolve challenges in Africa, but to make the world a better place.”</p>
      <p>Silicon Cape Director, Zimkhita Buwa added: “AfricArena is a platform filled with opportunity to showcase amazing African startups like these and give local and global investors an opportunity to hear their stories and provide the necessary funding required to scale these startups.”</p>
      <p>In addition to pitching sessions for the startups, the Summit hosted a refreshing session during which three tech hubs – Nairobi, Dakar and Cape Town – pitched to attract the best entrepreneurs.  Each hub came up with creative ideas to illustrate the strengths of their ecosystem.</p>
      <p>Finally, in a reversed role pitch battle, three investors –an Angel Investor and Chairman of ABAN (Nigeria), Tomi Davies; Boldewijn Sloet from Africa Tech Ventures (Kenya) and Danai Musandu from Goodwell Investments (Netherlands) – pitched to the startups and corporates.</p>
