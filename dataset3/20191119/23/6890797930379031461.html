      <p>From the RBA sockpuppet, Terry McCrann, <a href="https://www.heraldsun.com.au/business/terry-mccrann/terry-mccrann-rba-was-and-will-keep-assessing/news-story/f4995eb432943ca4447931f596fc6792">today</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>The Reserve Bank did not “seriously ponder” a “shock” Cup Day rate cut — as some have interpreted, or rather misinterpreted, the minutes of that meeting.<br/><br/>This is not just about getting ‘yesterday right’; it is even more important about not building in a misunderstanding of what the RBA is likely to do at its last meeting for the year in two weeks time.</blockquote>
