      <p>We're back again with another story regarding <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/conor-mcgregor">Conor McGregor</a>'s return, and just like most of the articles that have preceded the one you're about to fully read, there is still no confirmation. However, there is progress and that's a great sign if you ask us.</p>
      <p>Conor McGregor's manager Audie Attar spoke to South China Morning Post and revealed that the contract negotiations for his client's proposed <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/ufc">UFC</a> 246 fight against <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/donald-cowboy-cerrone">Donald Cerrone</a> are going well.</p>
      <p>He stated that the communications have happened between all the involved parties and the fans should expect an announcement on it soon. However, he did add that it still a work in progress.</p>
      <blockquote>“I would say that talks have been progressing. We’ve met them, we’re in close communication with them. I would hope that an announcement could happen in the coming weeks, but at the end of the day, it’s still a work in progress."

      <p>Conor McGregor hasn't fought since his crushing loss to Khabib Nurmagomedov at UFC 229 in October 2018.</p>
      <p>The Notorious One has since been in the news for all the wrong reasons for his run-ins with the law. The former UFC Double Champion did reveal recently that he would be back at UFC 246, which is scheduled to take place at the T-Mobile Arena on January 18th, 2020.</p>
      <p>While the names of many potential opponents were thrown into the mix, Donald Cerrone came out as the frontrunner to welcome McGregor back inside the Octagon.</p>
      <p>Cowboy is coming off two consecutive losses to Tony Ferguson and Justin Gaethje respectively, and considering his rousing popularity, a fight against McGregor is the perfect way to kick off the new year.</p>
      <p>We now await an official confirmation.</p>
