      <h1>Jameela Jamil Tells CupcakKe To Put Down Her Twitter Post For Promoting Unrealistic And ‘Dangerous’ Diet Change</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T23:45:45+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 23:45</time> by <a rel="author">Todd Malm</a></address>
      <p>According to a report from BET.com, Jameela Jamil recently shouted out to a rapper, but not in the way that the artist would’ve liked. Jamil, who has built a reputation for herself as a warrior for social justice, shared some of her opinions regarding the unusual weight-loss tactics employed by the rapper, CupcakKe.</p>
      <p>As a consequence of her comments on Twitter, Jamil reportedly became a target for many people online who consider her as just a buzz-kill, rather than a soldier for body positivity. On the 16th of November, Saturday, the rapper took to her account to show off her new look to fans.</p>
      <p>In the caption of the social media post, CupcakKe shared that she had done a water fast for a month and she lost a lot of weight because of it.</p>
      <p>Check out her photo below:</p>

      <p>For the most part, the reactions to the rapper’s mode of weight-loss were mixed, with some people congratulating her and others condemning her instead. Regardless, Jamil’s post on the platform quickly went viral among many people on the platform.</p>
      <p>Jamil urged CupcakKe to take down her post, because most people, she argued, won’t have the knowledge or “medical supervision” to pull off such a diet in the correct way, without leading to damage and health risks.</p>
      <p>Jamil also pointed out that such a diet harms a person’s metabolism. “It’s just very unsafe,” Jameela wrote. On Twitter, again, Jamil asked for CupcakKe to consider what she was posting on her account, asking her to be “very careful.”</p>

      <p>Many people on Twitter called out Jamil for thinking she had the right to determine how the rapper went about losing weight. For instance, one user told her that it would’ve been a better move to say it in a direct message rather than in front of the whole world to see.</p>
      <p>Another Twitter user, in particular, claimed CupcakKe recently stated she was retiring from music, after struggling with mental health issues, so perhaps wasn’t the best time to put her on blast. As most know, this wouldn’t be the first time Jamil called out a celebrity. She has criticized the Kardashian-Jenner clan as well for promoting purportedly questionable products.</p>
