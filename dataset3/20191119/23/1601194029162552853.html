      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/roman-reigns">Roman Reigns</a> is among a small group of WWE Superstars who is destined to be involved in a high-profile match at every WrestleMania.</p>
      <p>In previous years, the four-time WrestleMania main-eventer’s opponent at WWE’s biggest annual show has been heavily rumoured several months in advance (e.g. Brock Lesnar, The Undertaker and Triple H).</p>
      <p>However, with the exception of people fantasy booking him in a match against The Rock, there has not been much speculation about who “The Big Dog” could face at WrestleMania 36.</p>
      <h4>Could we see “The Fiend” vs. Roman Reigns?</h4>
      <p>According to <a href="https://wrestlingnews.co/wwe-news/wwe-has-bigger-plans-for-bray-wyatt-after-survivor-series">Wrestling News Co’s Paul Davis</a>, there are big plans for “The Fiend” <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/bray-wyatt">Bray Wyatt</a> at WrestleMania 36, which will take place in Tampa, Florida on April 5, 2020, and Roman Reigns is one of the Superstars who is being considered as a possible opponent for him at the event.</p>
      <p>This year, Reigns defeated Drew McIntyre at WrestleMania 35 in his first one-on-one match since he made his return to the ring from battling leukemia, while two-time World Champion Wyatt was not involved on the show in any capacity.</p>
      <p>Both men have featured prominently on WWE programming since then, and Wyatt’s “The Fiend” character now holds SmackDown’s top male title after he recently won the Universal Championship from Seth Rollins.</p>

      <h4>Bray Wyatt and Roman Reigns’ WrestleMania history</h4>
      <p>Although he was involved in big WrestleMania matches earlier in his career, Bray Wyatt has still never won on “The Grandest Stage of Them All”.</p>
      <p>His three singles matches at the event ended in defeats against John Cena (WrestleMania 30), The Undertaker (WrestleMania 31) and Randy Orton (WrestleMania 33), and he did not compete at WrestleMania 32, WrestleMania 34 or WrestleMania 35.</p>
      <p>In contrast, Reigns picked up victories as part of The Shield against The Big Show, Randy Orton &amp; Sheamus (WrestleMania 29) and Kane &amp; The New Age Outlaws (WrestleMania 30) before going on to headline the next four shows.</p>
      <p>He failed to defeat Brock Lesnar on two occasions (WrestleMania 31 and WrestleMania 34), while he recorded victories over Triple H (WrestleMania 32), The Undertaker (WrestleMania 33) and Drew McIntyre (WrestleMania 35).</p>
