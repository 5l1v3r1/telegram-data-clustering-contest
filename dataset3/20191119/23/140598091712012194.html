      <h1>Mick McCarthy confident that Ireland can still qualify for Euro 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T23:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 23:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/luke-edwards/" target="_blank">Luke Edwards</a></address>
      <p>Mick McCarthy is confident that he can guide the Republic of Ireland to Euro 2020 qualification despite an underwhelming campaign which fizzled out with <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/18/despair-ireland-miss-automatic-euro-2020-spot-draw-denmark/">a 1-1 draw against Denmark</a> in Dublin on Monday night.</p>
      <p>Ireland scored just seven goals in their eight group games and the lack of creativity, combined with the absence of a clinical striker, means few share his confidence.</p>
      <p>But with a four-month wait until the play-off semi-final in March, McCarthy is hoping that one of his forwards, including the 17-year-old Tottenham prospect Troy Parrott, can find some form for their clubs.</p>
      <p>“I think the disappointment of drawing the game and not [automatically] qualifying for the Euros now will be a lot less in March,” said McCarthy, who has only managed three competitive wins since replacing Martin O’Neill last year: against Gibraltar twice and Georgia at home.</p>
      <p>“They have Christmas, how many games do they play over Christmas, and then it's into January. They will be forgetting all of what has happened here and when they come back in March they will be fresh for two games so that might be a positive as well.”</p>
      <p>Sheffield United’s David McGoldrick has been Ireland’s first choice centre forward under McCarthy, but admitted after the Denmark game that his finishing “has not been good enough” for club or country this season, with just one goal in 11 appearances.</p>
      <p>“He is our best striker, there is no doubt about it,” said McCarthy, in defence of the 31-year-old. “That’s not being detrimental to all of the other lads because I think they would recognise that as well. </p>
      <p>“I don’t know, March comes around, let’s hope he’s fit. Let’s hope Troy gets into the [Tottenham] team, let’s hope he scores for the Under 21s and let’s hope he plays somewhere and gets some football.”</p>
      <p>Given that Parrott is unlikely to start any games in the Premier League for Spurs, Ireland will hope the teenager is sent out on loan in January, although <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/18/mauricio-pochettino-holds-crisis-talks-daniel-levy-tottenhams/">the uncertainty surrounding Mauricio Pochettino’s future</a> makes that far from clear as a new manager would want to see him in training before deciding whether to let him leave.</p>
      <p>Despite the deflation of missing out on automatic qualification, Ireland will at least face weaker opposition in the play-offs.</p>
      <p>“They’re all in the same place,” added McCarthy. “ All these teams in the play-offs, they probably haven’t won two games back to back either, so we’re all in the same place. They’re probably doing the same things as us. They probably won’t be at the same level as Denmark because we’re all in the play-offs”</p>
