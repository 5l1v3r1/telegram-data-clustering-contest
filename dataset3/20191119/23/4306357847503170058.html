      <h1>Liverpool FC warned Man United will be back by pundit</h1>
      <h2>Graeme Souness has his say on Liverpool FC's Premier League title hopes this season</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T23:30:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 23:30</time> by <a rel="author">The Sport Review staff</a></address>
      <h3>Graeme Souness believes that the Premier League is too competitive for Liverpool FC to dominate it for a prolonged period of time – and says Manchester United “will be back”.</h3>
      <p>The Reds are currently flying high at the top of the Premier League table after having won 11 of their 12 games this season to leave them eight points clear of the chasing pack.</p>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp’s men are the heavy favourites to win the Premier League title this season after their stunning start, with defending champions Manchester City currently down in fourth place in the table.</p>
      <p>Liverpool FC are aiming to go one step further than they did last season and lift the top-flight trophy this term after they finished a point behind Pep Guardiola’s men back in May.</p>
      <p>Former Reds star Souness feels that even if Liverpool FC do win the Premier League title this season, they will face intense competition from the likes of Manchester United, Chelsea FC and Manchester City to stay at the pinnacle of English football.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an interview quoted by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/liverpool-wont-dominate-premier-league-man-utd-will-back-says-graeme-souness-11175380/">Metro</a>, Souness said: “You can never say they will go into a period of dominance because you have to look at Manchester City – they will be around for a long time.</p>
      <p>“There’s the emergence of Chelsea ’s youngsters too. Will they get better in the next few years?</p>
      <p>“And Manchester United will be back, guaranteed. It’s just a case of when. So you can’t say Liverpool are going to dominate.</p>
      <p>“But once you’ve won the first one, it does give you a taste to win it again.</p>
      <p>“When I was there I was made to feel, ‘This is what we do – win leagues’.</p>
      <p>“That was the number one aim on the first day of the season, the league, not the European Cup. They felt that said more about you as an individual and a team.”</p>
      <p>Liverpool FC will return to Premier League action on Saturday when they take on Crystal Palace away from home.</p>
      <p>The Reds were impressive 3-1 winners over Manchester City at Anfield last time out.</p>
