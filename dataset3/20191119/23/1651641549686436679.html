      <h1>Apple finally making the transition to a services company with UWP apps for Windows</h1>

      <p>The iPod did not really explode until Apple provided support for Windows, and even today the vast majority of iPhone owners also run Windows.</p>
      <p>Apple has been a company in transition, with an increased emphasis on services as its iPhone business continue to flag. Part of this is <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/apple-tvgoes-on-air-on-november-1-to-compete-with-netflix-disney/">growing into a media company</a>, and Apple has been making a greater effort to be on more platforms, such as Samsung smart TVs.</p>
      <p>Now<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/1541300853/"> a job posting</a> indicated Apple is planning to bring their new media apps to one of the largest platforms, Windows 10.</p>
      <p>The job post for a Senior Software Engineer for Windows Media Apps urges the developer to “<i>Join us and build the next generation of media apps for Windows,</i>” and specifically mentions UWP as a recommended skill.</p>
      <p>It reads:</p>
      <blockquote>The Media Apps team is looking for a creative Senior Software Engineer to work on the next generation of media apps for Windows. You will help build innovative features that will delight millions of customers around the world.<br/>You possess strong skills in the areas of application design, solid API design principles and have a strong understanding of customer and workflow issues. You have a history of shipping large volume consumer product successfully. You are a well-rounded developer who is not afraid to question assumptions. You have an excellent written and oral skills. You love collaborating under tight deadlines.<br/>If you love music and you are passionate about writing code, and want to work with world-class engineering teams that ship to millions of users, the Media Apps team is the place for you.<br/>4+ years of industry experience<br/>Experience writing software in C/C++<br/>Deep understanding of API designs principles<br/>Experience with UWP is a big plus<br/>Experience in building large client facing applications.</blockquote>
      <p>We expect iTunes and  Apple TV Plus for Windows may be one of the first apps which would come to the platform, allowing Apple to expand its audience to those who are used to watching Netflix on their laptops.</p>
      <p>Hopefully, Microsoft will take some inspiration from Apple and make their next major app a UWP app also.</p>
