      <p>Match-winner Alex Fisher has praised Exeter City’s defence after they kept another clean sheet in their FA Cup success over Cambridge.</p>
      <p>Fisher, a summer signing from Yeovil, scored in the 70 minute, turning in a Ben Seymour cross, to boom the Grecians spot in round two at home to Hartlepool United.</p>
      <p>It was his second goal for the club after also hitting the net in the first clash between the two sides 10 days ago, but speaking after Tuesday night’s replay, he was also keen to praise the Grecians defence after they restricted Cambridge to just two shots all game, neither of which were on target.</p>
      <p>“One goal Grecians, I think the tag is,” the 29-year-old joked after the game. He added: “It was another very strong defensive display from us, which they have done it consistently this year, so as a forward nice to know you’ve got that behind you, and they allowed us to get a foothold into the game</p>
      <p> “It was quite a tough fixture tonight. They sat quite deep and wanted to hit us on the counter so were quite hard to break down. Sometimes it is not most entertaining football but when a team sits as deep as they did it can be difficult to break then down.</p>

      <p>“Lee Martin put in a great shift up there with me and we shared the load quite well. It is nice to get some goals early when I’ve got my first run of games, but if I’m not scoring then I want to be part of a team that has a run of wins at least. Personally though I’m delighted to have got another goal and hope to continue the run in the league.</p>
      <p>“We have a strong team and there may be changes for Saturday, or there may not be, but I’ll take each game as it comes and was delighted to contribute to the win tonight.”</p>
      <p>In round two, the Grecians will host Hartlepool United, currently 14 in the National League, but who hammered Fisher’s former club Yeovil 4-1 in the First Round.</p>

      <p>Looking ahead to the tie, he said: “It nice to be in the next round and to have another home tie. A third round tie would be great but we’ve got a big job against Hartlepool. They had quite a convincing win so it won’t be an easy fixture, so we have to take that game as it comes and only look at one game at a time.</p>
      <p>“A cup run would be great and fantastic for the club and the fans."</p>
