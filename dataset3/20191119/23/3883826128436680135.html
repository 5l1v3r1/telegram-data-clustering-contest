        <b>Police in the Netherlands have arrested a Romanian lorry driver after 25 stowaways were found in a refrigerated container on a ferry bound for the UK.</b>
      </p>
      <p>They were found at around 19:00 (18:00 GMT), forcing the ship to return to the port of Vlaardingen near Rotterdam.</p>
      <p>The Danish-registered ferry had been en route to Felixstowe.</p>
      <p>The incident comes just weeks after the bodies of 39 people were found in a refrigerated lorry container in Essex in eastern England.</p>
      <p>The stowaways found on Tuesday received medical attention at the port of Vlaardingen, where police were waiting for the ship's arrival.</p>
      <p>Two were taken to hospital to receive extra medical care, while the other 23 people were transferred to a police facility after a medical check-up, authorities said.</p>

      <p>The stowaways, whose nationalities have not yet been confirmed, were found in a refrigerated container on a lorry on board the ferry, authorities said. The driver of the lorry was detained and was being questioned over possible involvement, police told the Dutch broadcaster NOS.</p>
      <p>Police told the broadcast that crew members found the stowaways and alerted authorities after hearing "sounds coming from the cooling container". A search of the ferry involving police dogs was carried out but no-one else was found.</p>
      <p>Seafarers' charity Stella Maris said it was important to recognise the "hugely stressful" nature of these types of incidents for crew.</p>
      <p>The bodies found in the Essex container last month were those of Vietnamese nationals who had arrived on a ferry from Zeebrugge in Belgium.</p>
      <p>Two lorry drivers have since been charged with manslaughter, and several other men have been arrested in connection with the case.</p>
