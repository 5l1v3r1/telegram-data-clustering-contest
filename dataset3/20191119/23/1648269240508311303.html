      <h1>FCA Celebrates 15 Million Minivans Sold With A Crazy Photo Collage</h1>
      <h2>That's a lot of minivans . . . and minivan photos.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T23:59:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 23:59</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.motor1.com/info/team/christopher-smith/" target="_blank">Christopher Smith</a></address>
      <p>The year was 1983. Station wagons still prowled the streets of America as the premier family vehicle. Even midsize estates had the ability to seat six adults, and the large three-row wagons with rear-facing jump seats could accommodate two more. It was the pinnacle of boring family motoring, but then came something extraordinary – the 1984 <a href="https://www.motor1.com/dodge/grand-caravan/">Dodge Caravan</a> and it’s slightly upscale sibling, the Plymouth Voyager. The minivan was born.</p>

      <p>Unlike small vans like the VW Vanagon, Chrysler’s minivan offered U.S. buyers family-size accommodations in a more mainstream package that was <i>decidedly</i> cooler than a station wagon. The Ford Aerostar and Chevrolet Astro soon followed, not to mention further evolutions of the concept like the Ford Freestar, Mercury Villager, Chevrolet Lumina APV, Oldsmobile Silhouette, and the flashy-yet-tacky Pontiac Trans Sport. The original machine, however, was the Dodge Caravan. And after 35 years, it’s the only moniker mentioned in this article that’s still alive.</p>

      <p>Not only that, 15 million minivans have sold throughout Chrysler’s various ups, downs, and partnerships through the years. To mark the occasion, FCA sent us the spiffy photo you see above which is compiled of 15 million minivan photos. Actually, we have no idea how many photos were used to make this image – FCA’s press release on the subject didn’t offer any details but hey, 15 million images would be a great homage to the minivan and when you look really close at the wheels in this photo, you’ll see that <i>every pixel is a minivan photo</i>. Maybe we’re not just blowing smoke after all?</p>

      <p>“Reaching 15 million minivans sold isn’t just about hitting a number, it’s about the memories families have made and the children who have grown up driven to school or practice or on a family road trip in a Chrysler Pacifica or Pacifica Hybrid, Dodge Caravan or Grand Caravan, Chrysler Town &amp; Country or Voyager over the past three and a half decades,” said Tim Kuniskis, Global Head of Alfa Romeo and Head of Passenger Cars – Dodge, SRT, Chrysler and FIAT, FCA – North America. “We continue to lead and innovate to keep our current minivan lineup the absolute best at hauling people and things and help this generation of owners make memories that will last a lifetime.”</p>

        <p>Special Employee Pricing now available on 2020 Chrysler Pacifica gas-powered models starting Nov. 20</p>
        <p>November 20, 2019, Auburn Hills, Mich. - FCA is celebrating 15 million minivans sold and counting since the very first minivan — a Plymouth Voyager — rolled off the line at Windsor Assembly on Nov. 2, 1983. Today, FCA continues to lead with more than half of the minivan segment in the United States, with a 54 percent share, selling twice as many minivans as any other manufacturer over more than 35 years. <br/><br/>“Reaching 15 million minivans sold isn’t just about hitting a number, it’s about the memories families have made and the children who have grown up driven to school or practice or on a family road trip in a Chrysler Pacifica or Pacifica Hybrid, Dodge Caravan or Grand Caravan, Chrysler Town &amp; Country or Voyager over the past three and a half decades,” said Tim Kuniskis, Global Head of Alfa Romeo and Head of Passenger Cars – Dodge, SRT, Chrysler and FIAT, FCA – North America. “We continue to lead and innovate to keep our current minivan lineup the absolute best at hauling people and things and help this generation of owners make memories that will last a lifetime.”<br/><br/>As the first company to introduce the minivan and through six generations of the vehicle, FCA has innovated 115 minivan firsts — features that continue to make life easier for owners and their entire families and push the segment into the future. FCA firsts include the class-exclusive Stow ‘n Go seating and storage system, Uconnect Theater, hands-free sliding doors and the only hybrid electric powertrain in the segment.<br/><br/>Today’s FCA minivan lineup includes the Chrysler Pacifica, Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid, Chrysler Voyager and Dodge Grand Caravan.<br/><br/>The Chrysler Pacifica and Pacifica Hybrid continue to revolutionize and reinvent the minivan segment. The Pacifica Hybrid is America’s first and only hybrid minivan and is among the top five best-selling plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) in the industry. Pacifica Hybrid achieves 82 miles per gallon equivalent (MPGe) in electric-only mode, has an all-electric range of 32 miles and a total range of more than 500 miles. <br/><br/>New for 2020, the award-winning FCA US minivan lineup expands with the addition of the Chrysler Voyager, which offers even more value for those who seek the quintessential family vehicle. Designed with budget-friendly family and fleet customers in mind, the Voyager delivers an exceptional driving experience. Voyager is also the latest Chrysler brand minivan to earn a five-star overall safety rating from the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), recently joining Chrysler Pacifica in the five-star category.<br/><br/>As America’s best-selling minivan ever, the Dodge Grand Caravan continues its decades-long history of offering families style, versatility and useful features at a tremendous value. The Grand Caravan has introduced nearly 80 segment firsts, including the industry-exclusive Super Stow ‘n Go seating, which can be easily operated with one hand, allowing users to convert seating for seven to a spacious cargo bed in seconds. <br/><br/><b>FCA Keeps Minivan Segment Fresh With Chrysler Pacifica Red S Edition</b><br/>FCA’s current lineup continues to dominate and innovate in the minivan segment with vehicles such as the new Chrysler Pacifica Red S Edition. The Chrysler Pacifica Red S Edition will be on exhibit during AutoMobility LA 2019 at the Los Angeles Convention Center Nov. 20-21 and will continue on display at LA Auto Show 2019, which will be open to the public on Nov. 22-Dec 1.<br/><br/>With a striking crimson appearance, the Chrysler Pacifica Red S Edition brings a new look and a huge burst of attitude and color to Pacifica’s already class-leading functional interior. The exclusive Red S interior features Rodèo Red premium Nappa leather two-tone seats accented by Light Diesel Grey stitching and piping and an “S” logo on the seatbacks. Silver Metal Brush hydro bezels embellish the instrument panel and door trim.<br/><br/>Exterior finishes include a Red S liftgate badge and Black Noise Chrysler wing badges with Velvet Red inserts. The Pacifica Red S Edition rides on 20-inch wheels (18-inch on Pacifica Hybrid) with a Black Noise finish. The package is rounded out by standard Advanced SafetyTec, featuring more than 100 safety and security features, 20-speaker Harman Kardon premium audio and KeySense.<br/><br/>The Red S Edition will be available in a range of six exterior paint color options, including the new-for-2020 Ceramic Grey Clear Coat, as well as Brilliant Black Crystal Pearl Coat, Granite Crystal Metallic Clear Coat, Billet Metallic Clear Coat, Bright White Clear Coat and Maximum Steel Clear Coat. <br/><br/>The new Red S Edition package is available on both Pacifica Limited gas and hybrid (late availability) models. Ordering for the package is now open for gas models at Chrysler dealerships at a U.S. Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) of $3,995 for the Red S Edition package.<br/><br/>A Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid S Appearance Package will also be on display in LA. One out of every three Chrysler Pacifica models sold features the popular S Appearance Package, which features black accents inside and out, creating a customized, athletic look. The package includes 18-inch wheels with a Black Noise finish and badging, Gloss Black accents throughout the exterior and an all-black interior with black seats with Light Diesel Gray accents and the “S” logo<br/><br/><b>Employee Pricing Available On 2020 Chrysler Pacifica Starting Nov. 20</b><br/>Starting Nov. 20, customers can take advantage of a special incentive to help bring home a new 2020 Chrysler Pacifica (gas-powered model only). All consumers (non-FCA employees/retirees) can purchase or lease an eligible FCA vehicle, including the Chrysler Pacifica, at a special Employee Price incentive from a participating dealership under the program.<br/><br/>The Employee Price incentive is available for eligible 2020 model-year vehicles from Nov. 20 through Jan. 2, 2020.<br/><br/><b>15 Fun Facts For 15 Million Minivans Sold</b></p>
