      <h1>CFL aims to tackle domestic violence; commissioner says more awareness needed</h1>

      <p>CFL commissioner Randy Ambrosie joined Culture, Multiculturalism and Status of Women Minister Leela Aheer on Tuesday morning in Calgary to call for greater efforts to end domestic and gender-based violence.</p>
      <p>Ambrosie, who is in Calgary for this weekend’s Grey Cup game and the festival leading up to it, said more awareness is needed when it comes to the issue. The pair met with representatives of local domestic violence organizations to discuss “best practices.”</p>
      <p>“We hope that this will be the start of a much bigger conversation that will open the doors for teams across the country to collaborate with their local organizations to make a difference,” said Aheer.</p>
      <p>Ambrosie said that while the CFL has a formal policy for violence against women, which includes mandatory awareness training for all league employees, it has more to do to become a leader in this area.</p>
      <p>He said the CFL has a responsibility to “set an example.” Part of that comes from thinking “about women differently,” according to the commissioner.</p>
      <p>“If you had that frame of reference, ‘how would I want my daughter to be treated in this moment, how would I want my mother or sister to be treated in this moment,’ I think is a fantastic way to think about it,” said Ambrosie.</p>
      <p>In a male-dominated sports league, he added that attitudes can quickly be changed with the proper education.</p>
      <p>“Somebody says something that might’ve been funny or you perceived to be funny and now a player who’s gone to a program, who’s heard a story, who’s done the training, will go now, ‘guys, that’s not funny at all.’ It just starts with that attitude,” said Ambrosie.</p>
      <p>“It starts with creating that foundation on which your perceptions of the world exist.”</p>

      <p>Aheer cited the UCP government’s commitments to helping victims of violence and abuse.</p>
      <p>In October, it introduced Bill 17, or “<a href="https://edmontonjournal.com/news/local-news/watch-clares-law-introduced-to-reduce-domestic-violence">Clare’s Law,</a>” which will allow victims or potential victims of domestic violence to obtain information from police about whether an intimate partner has a violent or abusive past.</p>
      <p>Last month’s provincial budget also included $6 million in funding for a new sexual-assault hotline.</p>
      <p>But domestic-violence experts <a href="https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/shame-on-them-domestic-violence-experts-gutted-after-provincial-budget-excludes-funding-for-electronic-monitoring">criticized the government</a> after the budget revealed there would be no funding for electronic monitoring of perpetrators, contrary to a promise made during the spring election campaign.</p>
      <p>The program prevents those serving sentences in the community from having contact with their victims. The device alerts authorities if an offender is in an area they shouldn’t be, which is considered one of the first indicators they might reoffend.</p>
      <p>The lack of funding would require agencies to continue relying on corporate sponsorship, stretched funding and community donations, groups said.</p>
