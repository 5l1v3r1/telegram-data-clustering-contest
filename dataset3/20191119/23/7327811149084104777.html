      <p>Two Illinois state troopers and a stranded driver narrowly missed being hit by a jackknifed truck.</p>
      <p>The troopers had stopped to help change a flat tire for the driver. They were all working on the side of an icy highway.</p>
      <p>On dash video, a truck can be seen losing control and barreling across the interstate.</p>
      <p>The two troopers and the stranded driver escaped uninjured. The driver of the truck was ticketed for failing to slow down to avoid the crash.</p>
      <p>Officials said they hope the crash serves as a reminder for drivers to take it slow and move over for cars stopped on the shoulder.</p>
