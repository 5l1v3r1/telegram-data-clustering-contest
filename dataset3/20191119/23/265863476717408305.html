      <h1>RHOBH – Brandi Glanville Confirms She Will Be A Part of Season 10 &amp; Calls Out Camille Grammer For Avoiding Her At Kyle Richards’ Party</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T23:19:24+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 23:19</time> by <a rel="author">Suzy Kerr</a></address>
      <p><i>Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</i> alum <a href="https://celebrityinsider.org/brandi-glanville-goes-on-crazy-rant-against-camille-grammer-keep-my-name-out-of-your-mouth-308986/">Brandi Glanville</a> revealed on the most recent episode of her podcast <i>Unfiltered</i> that she will be making an appearance in Season 10 of <i>RHOBH</i>. Glanville said that she attended Kyle Richards’ Los Angeles Children’s Hospital fundraiser last week, and Bravo cameras were on hand for the event.</p>
      <p>The fundraiser guests featured a who’s who of current and former <i>Housewives,</i> including Eileen Davidson, Adrienne Maloof, Dorit Kemsley, Teddie Mellencamp, Denise Richards, Erika Jayne, Lisa Rinna, and newbie Garcelle Beauvais. Also in attendance was Camille Grammer, but Glanville called her out for trying to hide from her the entire night.</p>

      <p>“I will be back a little bit and that is all we know right now,” explained Glanville. “There’s some stuff going down. It’s not gonna be PC, I’ll tell you that. Everyone’s like, ‘Oh, everyone loves each other.’ Not true. Sh*t’s going down right now, and we’ll all figure it out soon enough.”</p>
      <p>Glanville said Grammer wasn’t afraid to talk trash on social media, but she wouldn’t talk to her face-to-face. The <i>RHOBH</i> alum was vocal about Grammer’s tweet that suggested Richards was the mastermind behind Glanville’s appearance last season so they could irritate Lisa Vanderpump.</p>
      <p>The two also had a Twitter war last year when they argued back and forth about who had the “toughest” first season on <i>RHOBH</i>. Glanville said she has attempted to talk to Grammer in person so they could smooth things over, but Grammer has never responded.</p>
      <p>“Camille was there and Camille had previously come after me on Twitter. I have to say this, Camille and I — we’re always friends — so for her to come after me on Twitter was just weird and odd to me, but I felt like maybe it came from a British woman we won’t talk about, that was telling her what to say,” said Glanville.</p>

      <p>Glanville said that at the party she told <i>RHOBH</i> producers that she wanted to talk to Grammer, and they told her that she was afraid of her. Glanville says Grammer avoided her, and even though she saw her walk in, she never saw her again the entire night and the two ladies never spoke.</p>
      <p>After Glanville tweeted about Grammer’s behavior at the party, Grammer actually responded and said that she never told anyone at the party she was afraid of her. Grammer said she was “perplexed,” and said Glanville needs to find a new “victim” because she’s barely on <i>RHOBH.</i></p>
      <p>“If she is looking for a 💎 she needs to find another way back,” wrote Grammer.</p>
      <p>On her podcast, Glanville said that if Grammer is “gonna be a gangster on Twitter,” then she needs to come out and have a conversation. Brandi Glanville then doubled down on her original claim, and said that producers told her Grammer was hiding. However, Glanville says she likes Grammer, and they can still sit and talk things out.</p>
      <p>Season 10 of <i>Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</i> will premiere on Bravo in early 2020.</p>
