      <h1>Tommaso Ciampa and WWE United Kingdom Champion WALTER to appear for EVOLVE Wrestling in Detroit and Chicago</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T23:14:24+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 23:14</time> by <a rel="author">WWE.com</a></address>
      <p>Fans in Detroit and Chicago will get the chance to meet former NXT Champion Tommaso Ciampa and see WWE United Kingdom Champion WALTER in action, along with even more competitors from NXT, at EVOLVE Wrestling’s upcoming events in Detroit and Chicago.</p>
      <p>Following his recent appearances on Raw and SmackDown, WALTER will step into the EVOLVE ring on Dec. 6 just outside of Detroit, in Livonia, Mich.’s Monaghan Knights of Columbus Hall to battle his longtime tag team partner Timothy Thatcher. On Dec. 6, The Ring General will be at the Logan Square Auditorium to take on the brand new EVOLVE Champion, Josh Briggs. Briggs dethroned WWE Performance Center recruit Austin Theory earlier this month and retained his title one night later. How will the big man fare against the WWE United Kingdom Champion?</p>
      <p>WALTER will also be available for meet-and-greets with fans on both nights, as will former NXT Champion Tommaso Ciampa. In addition, NXT Superstars including Babatunde, Arturo Ruas, Reina Gonzalez and new WWE Performance Center recruit Shotzi Blackheart will also be in action.</p>
