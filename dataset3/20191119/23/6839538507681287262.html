      <p>Australia’s financial intelligence agency is pursuing Westpac for alleged breaches of money laundering and counter-terror laws.</p>
      <p>AUSTRAC chief executive Nicole Rose said the bank failed to report more than 19.5 million international fund transfers amounting to more than $11 billion over nearly five years.</p>
      <p>“Westpac failed to pass on information about the origin of international funds transfers and keep records as required,” she said this morning.</p>
      <p>Ms Rose said Westpac also failed to do customer due diligence on high-risk transactions to the Philippines and south-east Asia with potential child exploitation risks.</p>
      <p>“AUSTRAC alleges that Westpac’s oversight of its corresponding banking services was deficient, and that its oversight of its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing program was also deficient,” she said.</p>
      <p>Ms Rose said the failures resulted in serious and systemic breaches of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws, which were allegedly broken 23 million times.</p>
      <p>“This resulted in a significant loss of intelligence to AUSTRAC and our national security and law enforcement partners,” Ms Rose said.</p>
      <p>Any penalties will be decided in court, with civil proceedings now underway.</p>
      <p>Ms Rose said business was the first line of defence to protect the financial system from criminal abuse.</p>
      <p>“This is an important reminder to all financial services businesses to be vigilant about money-laundering and counter-terrorism financing risks and understand their obligations,” she said.</p>
      <p>Westpac said it self-reported the failure to report a large number of international funds transfer instructions to AUSTRAC.</p>
      <p>“AUSTRAC was also investigating a number of other areas relating to Westpac’s processes, procedures and oversight,” the bank said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“Westpac is currently reviewing AUSTRAC’s statement of claim and will issue a further statement to the ASX once it has been assessed.”</p>
