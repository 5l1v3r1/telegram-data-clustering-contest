      <h1>The big name manager besides Jose Mourinho that Daniel Levy will have on Tottenham shortlist</h1>
      <h2>Tottenham have parted ways with Mauricio Pochettino after the Argentinian enjoyed five years at the club</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T23:15:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 23:15</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Clarke</a></address>
      <p>Tottenham Hotspur have taken the decision to sack <a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/mauricio-pochettino">Mauricio Pochettino</a> and bring an end to his tenure which started in 2014.</p>
      <p>Pochettino oversaw four consecutive top-four finishes in the Premier League, something which is seriously under threat this season as the club sit 14th in the table.</p>
      <p>But on the back of a campaign which ended with a trip to Madrid to contest the Champions League final, which Spurs lost 2-0 to Liverpool, nobody could have expected the dramatic downfall of Pochettino and <a href="https://www.football.london/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Spurs</a>.</p>
      <p>Now the big question is who will take over the job on a permanent basis?</p>
      <p>That man could be <a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/jose-mourinho">Jose Mourinho</a>, with the 56-year-old said to be interested in replacing Pochettino.</p>
      <p>But if the former Manchester United and Chelsea boss doesn't accept any offer put to him by club chairman Daniel Levy, ex-Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp believes another big name in Carlo Ancelotti, formerly of Chelsea and currently in charge of Napoli, will be on the shortlist.</p>
      <p>"It’s a great time to walk in there as manager," <a href="https://talksport.com/football/632018/mauricio-pochettino-sacking-harry-redknapp-tottenham/">Redknapp told talkSPORT</a>.</p>
      <p>"They are as low as they can get at the moment and the only way is up. A little bit like when I took over, bottom of the league, there was only one way – up.</p>
      <p>"Mourinho, I would think is on the list. When he [Levy] got rid of me he tried to get [Carlo] Ancelotti. He offered him the job at that time and I think he would be on the list too. People talk about Eddie Howe but I can’t see him going for Eddie."</p>
