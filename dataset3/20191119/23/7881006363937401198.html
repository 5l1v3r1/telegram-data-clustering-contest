      <p><b>KOCHI: </b>The pillion riders of two-wheelers will not be allowed to enjoy a ride and risk their lives without helmets from December.</p>
      <p>A Division Bench comprising the Chief Justice on Tuesday told the state government to enforce the amendment to the Central Motor Vehicles Act which makes wearing of helmets mandatory by all riding on two-wheelers except children below the age of four. The government told the court that the rule will be implemented strictly from December.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>A single bench had in 2015 stayed the amendment to the law brought by the state government in 2003 allowing relaxation in the Central Motor Vehicles Act that stipulated wearing of helmets. The Division Bench heard the appeal filed by the government against this order and also transferred to it and heard another petition filed by an individual before the single judge bench.</p>
      <p>The Centre which on August 9 last repealed the authority given to the state government on rules governing helmet-wearing, brought out an amendment making it clear that all riders of two-wheelers should wear helmets. The Division Bench said that following this, the state government cannot give any...<br/>relaxation. It also said that the helmet should be worn fully protecting the head.</p>
      <p>The state government in its response said a circular on the rule will be prepared and the notification will be issued soon. The Division Bench said more time cannot be allowed on the matter and asked the government not to invite contempt of court proceedings in this regard.</p>
