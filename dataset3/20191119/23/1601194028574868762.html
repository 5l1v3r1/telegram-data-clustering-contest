      <p>It is the Survivor Series week and things are heating up! Today's roundup has a lot of interesting stories and it's easily the biggest one I've had the pleasure of presenting in a long time!</p>
      <p>We take a look at a major spoiler for Survivor Series right at the end but before that, there are a few things that need to be taken note of as well. Nia Jax has taken a shot at Becky Lynch, Triple H is set to make his in-ring return, and finally, one particular RAW Superstar who went off script on the show last night!</p>
      <p>Let's kick things off with the two headline-makers of the day:</p>
      <h4>Vince McMahon's plans for Bray Wyatt</h4>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/vince-mcmahon">Vince McMahon</a> might not be the most popular figure among the WWE Universe but the man is a genius. This company wouldn't be anything without him and he is proving time and again that he has ideas that nobody can match in this industry.</p>
      <p>Now, Vince is reportedly set to keep <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/bray-wyatt">Bray Wyatt</a> on a winning run for the foreseeable future. <a href="https://wrestlingnews.co/wwe-news/wwe-has-bigger-plans-for-bray-wyatt-after-survivor-series">Wrestling News Co’s Paul Davis</a> has reported that the chairman is keen on keeping Wyatt's momentum going and will not have him pinned by anyone until he finds the right guy.</p>
      <h4>CM Punk on Royal Rumble rumors</h4>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/cm-punk">CM Punk</a> is on WWE Backstage and the WWE Universe is excited. The fans want him to return to the ring soon and rumors/fan theories have been doing the rounds indicating that he could be involved in the Royal Rumble.</p>

      <p>However, Punk has put an end to all that and said that he has no plans of entering the Rumble. He also revealed that he will be talking about it but won't be participating.</p>
      <p>He has also made it clear that he is working for FOX and not WWE! His contract is just with the network and not with the wrestling company.</p>
