      <h2>After a row between Adele and Roman in the celebrity jungle, the public voted them for the next eating Bushtucker trial</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T23:19:24+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 23:19</time> by <a rel="author">Verity Sulway, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/verity-sulway/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm a Celebrity</a> stars Adele Roberts and Roman Kemp will be the next campmates subjected to a horrifying Bushtucker trial.</p>
      <p>They found out their fate after a public vote which revealed viewers turned on Adele and Roman following their row.</p>
      <p>Adele was upset by Roman's questioning that she brought in a framed photo of Loose Women's Jane McDonald as her luxury item.</p>
      <p>Roman apologised for upsetting her, and they embraced in an awkward hug.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow night, the two radio presenters will go head to head in Just Desserts, the first eating trial of the series.</p>

      <p>The pair will have to eat whatever the show bosses put in front of them, in order to win meals for the camp.</p>
      <p>Viewers took to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> to voice their glee at the warring campmates being voted for the horror challenge.</p>
      <p>"The fact Adele and Roman have been voted for this trial together already says the public are loving the tension (and...over Jane McDonald LOL)", said one.</p>
      <p>"Everyone defo put Roman in the trial with Adele cos she didnt like how he spoke about Jane", predicted another.</p>

      <p>"Finding it so funny adele got the trial with Roman after his 'prejudice'", laughed another.</p>
      <p>A fourth pondered: "I’m guessing Roman was voted for the trial as he’s a favourite, and Adele was voted because she’s annoying people?"</p>
      <p>The clash started when Roman admitted he was puzzled why Adele chose a picture of Jane McDonald as her luxury item.</p>
      <p>When asked if she knows any of her songs, Adele said: “I know her off Loose Women, I don’t know her actual songs but I know her from the cruising show when she does covers.”</p>

      <p>Giggling Roman caused offence when he claimed: "No one knows what she does."</p>
      <p>Adele strongly insisted: "That’s prejudice, I’m allowed to like what I want."</p>
      <p>Realising he had upset Adele, Roman said: "I wasn't saying that at all, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to."</p>

      <p>But the bickering did not stop there as Roman claimed he found the situation "funny".</p>
      <p>Adele sarcastically asked: "I’m not allowed to like what I want?"</p>
      <p>The DJ got Kate's backing and Roman apologised once again for winding Adele up.</p>
      <p>She said: "It’s fine, you are just going on about it so much…"</p>
