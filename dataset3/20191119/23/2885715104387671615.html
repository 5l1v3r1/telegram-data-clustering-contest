      <h1>Excluded from regularisation plan: Homes on Yamuna O-Zone, ASI land</h1>
      <h2>Parts of several areas in East and North East Delhi like Okhla, Karawal Nagar, Yamuna Vihar come under the O-Zone of the Yamuna floodplains.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T23:49:52+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 23:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/express-news-service/" target="_blank">Express News Service</a></address>
      <p>Houses built on the Yamuna O-Zone, land belonging to the Archaeological Survey of India, land earmarked for roads in the Master Plan and houses built under high-tension lines will not be part of the Delhi Development Authority’s (DDA) plan to give ownership rights in unauthorised colonies, a senior DDA official said.</p>
      <p>Flood-prone areas come under the O-Zone and, hence, there is an embargo on any construction in this zone by the DDA. However, illegal constructions have proliferated in these areas over the last several years.</p>
      <p>Parts of several areas in East and North East Delhi like Okhla, Karawal Nagar, Yamuna Vihar come under the O-Zone of the Yamuna floodplains.</p>
      <p>As per estimates, around 4 lakh people are likely to be left out with these rules, mainly people who built houses on encroached government land. Last month, the Union Cabinet approved grant of ownership rights to people living in 1,797 identified unauthorised colonies in Delhi — a move that will benefit 40 lakh people mostly belonging to lower income groups.</p>
