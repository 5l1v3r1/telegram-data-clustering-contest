      <p>SANAA: Yemen's Iran-backed Huthi rebels seized a Saudi-flagged tug and two South Korean vessels at the weekend, the insurgents and Seoul officials said on Tuesday (Nov 19).</p>
      <p>The incident follows a lull in Huthi attacks on Saudi Arabia as one Riyadh official said the kingdom had established an "open channel" with the rebels in a bid to end the four-year conflict.</p>

      <p>The Huthis acknowledged they had seized three ships, including a Saudi one, in the Red Sea a few miles off Uqban island, west of the rebel-held capital Sanaa.</p>
      <p>Seoul's foreign ministry said a South Korean dredger was being towed by one Korean and one Saudi-flagged tug when they were seized by the Huthis.</p>
      <p>It added that a total of 16 crew, two of them South Korean, had been taken to the Red Sea port of Saleef, where they were being held by the rebels.</p>
      <p>"All of our citizens ... are healthy and safe," ministry officials said in a statement. "We are doing our very best for the early release of our citizens."</p>
      <p>Seoul has sent the South Korean navy ship Cheonghae, which had been on anti-piracy standby off the coast of Oman, to waters near where the incident took place.</p>
      <p>The Saudi-led military coalition backing Yemen's internationally recognised government accused the rebels of "hijacking" the Rabigh-3, which a global tracking website described as a Saudi-flagged vessel.</p>
      <p>A Saudi cabinet session, chaired by King Salman, also condemned the rebels on Tuesday, saying such incidents pose a threat to the freedom of international navigation and trade.</p>
      <p>The rebels sought to defend their action, saying in a statement carried by their Al-Masirah television channel that the three ships were seized off Uqban island after they entered "territorial waters without prior notice".</p>
      <p>The ships were taken to Saleef, it added, without disclosing the nationalities or number of crew members.</p>
      <p>The Huthi rebels have been fighting the government and its allies for more than four years in a war that has pushed the country to the brink of famine.</p>
      <p>A year after the Huthis seized Sanaa, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and their allies intervened in the conflict in support of President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi.</p>
      <p>Since 2015, tens of thousands of people - most of them civilians - have been killed in a conflict that has triggered what the United Nations has described as the world's worst humanitarian crisis.</p>
