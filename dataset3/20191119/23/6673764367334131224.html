      <p>Shinzo Abe became Japan’s longest-serving prime minister by marking his 2,887th day in office on Wednesday, overtaking Taro Katsura, who led the country for 2,886 days in the early 1900s.</p>
      <p>Enjoying stable political footing even nearly seven years after returning to power in 2012, Abe may continue rewriting all-time records until his current term of office as president of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party expires in September 2021.</p>
      <p>Abe has denied his intention to seek another term as LDP president, although some party members want him to stay in power.</p>
      <p>During the current remaining term as LDP leader, Abe aims to pave the way for realizing his political ambitions, including constitutional revisions.</p>
      <p>Abe first took the post of prime minister in September 2006 at the age of 52, becoming the country’s youngest leader in the post-World War II era. But he stepped down only a year later due to a series of resignations by ministers of his Cabinet as well as his health problems.</p>
      <p>After returning to power in December 2012, Abe visited Tokyo’s Yasukuni Shrine as he regretted not visiting the Shinto shrine during his first stint as prime minister.</p>
      <p>The shrine is regarded as a symbol of Japan’s past militarism by China and South Korea as it honors Class-A World War II criminals along with the war dead.</p>
      <p>In 2014, the Abe Cabinet approved a plan to allow Japan to exercise the right to collective self-defense.</p>
      <p>Still, Abe is halfway to accomplishing many of his goals.</p>
      <p>It now seems difficult for him to realize a goal of putting a revised Constitution into force in 2020 due to persistent resistance from opposition lawmakers.</p>
      <p>Negotiations on a territorial dispute between Tokyo and Moscow over four Russian-held islands off Hokkaido have been stalled, although Abe has been vowing to put an end to the decades-old row by himself.</p>
      <p>Abe has also been struggling to resolve the issue of abductions of Japanese nationals by North Korea decades ago, one of his most important challenges.</p>
      <p>If Abe stays in power, his consecutive days in office since returning to power will hit an all-time record next August, surpassing the record 2,798 days set by Eisaku Sato.</p>
