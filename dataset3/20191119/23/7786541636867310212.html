      <p>This began in March, when the officers gave John Efford a jaywalking citation on Holcomb Bridge Road in Gwinnett County. </p>
      <p>Efford said that a couple of minutes later, the same officers approached him again, saying he jaywalked again. He said that's when they refused to answer his questions and began using a Taser on him.</p>
      <p>"I was terrified," Efford told<a href="https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/gwinnett-county/man-on-way-to-job-interview-says-he-was-tasered-by-officers-for-jaywalking/1010354876"> WSB-TV.</a></p>
      <p>He was charged with two counts of obstruction and improper crossing a roadway.</p>
      <p>Police sent <a href="https://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/gwinnett-county/man-on-way-to-job-interview-says-he-was-tasered-by-officers-for-jaywalking/1010354876">WSB-TV</a> a use of force report that indicated the level of force used was within policy. It said Efford refused to follow verbal commands and physically resisted.</p>
      <p>An officer's body cam video recorded the incident. </p>
      <p>"Hands behind your back now! Cuff him. You're going to get Tased again," an officer is heard on video. </p>
      <p>Once officers arrested Efford, he asked what he did</p>
      <p>"You jaywalked again right in front of us. Again, bro," the officer said. </p>
      <p>"Y'all doing all that over jaywalking?" Efford responded. </p>
      <p>Efford said the officers used excessive force and he said it was unlawful arrest.</p>
      <p>"This video is a classic case of police brutality," said his attorney, Jackie Patterson. </p>
      <p>Patterson said officers terrorized his client for no reason.</p>
      <p>"All you had to do was write him a ticket and let him go," Patterson said.</p>
      <p>Patterson said the charges were dropped after prosecutors saw the video.</p>
      <p>Efford is not letting this go.</p>
      <p>"I want them to lose their jobs," Efford said.</p>
      <p>In the use of force report, a major said Officer Charles Bynum was counseled on the importance of advising suspects they are under arrest.</p>
      <p>Another major said the officer's version of what happened and the video were not consistent. Still, it said the use of force was within policy.</p>
      <p>Efford said he plans to file a lawsuit.</p>
