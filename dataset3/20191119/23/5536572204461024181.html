      <p>This story is literally a scene out of White Men Can’t Jump.</p>
      <p>In a LaMelo Ball profile by Bleacher Report’s <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2862307-the-life-of-lamelo">Mirin Fader</a> titled The Life of LaMelo, the 18-year-old basketball phenom told a heroic story of the time his father, LaVar Ball, saved him and his brothers after shots rang out during a basketball game.</p>
      <blockquote>“LaMelo remembers one afternoon in a gym in a rough neighborhood in Los Angeles when he was four. He remembers shooting off to the side with LaVar while Lonzo and Gelo were playing pickup with grown men. Someone fouled hard, and a verbal altercation broke out. “All right! All right! I’mma be back!” one man threatened.<br/><br/>He did come back. He slid through the back door with a black hoodie on, carrying a gun. “Shot the whole gym up,” LaMelo says. “Pop pop pop pop.” He remembers how in a split second, his feet dangled in the air, his tiny body sheltered by his father’s stomach. LaVar had scooped him, Lonzo and Gelo up in his arms, somehow carrying all three while running, running so hard, out of the gym.”</blockquote>
      <p>Imagine the panic and commotion that went on while some idiot shoots bullets indiscriminately into a crowd of people because he was upset over a game.</p>
      <p>Seriously, literally the scene in White Men Can’t Jump.</p>
