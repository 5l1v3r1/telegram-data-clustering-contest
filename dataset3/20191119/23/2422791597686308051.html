      <p>BOSTON - "Full House" actress Lori Loughlin and her fashion designer husband are contesting expanded charges against them in the college admissions bribery scandal.</p>
      <p>Lawyers for Loughlin and Mossimo Giannulli entered not guilty pleas on their behalf Tuesday to charges of conspiracy to commit federal program bribery.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, the couple waived their right to appear in federal court in Boston to answer to the latest counts.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors added the bribery charge for 11 parents who previously pleaded not guilty in the case. Another 19 parents have pleaded guilty or agreed to do so.</p>
      <p>Loughlin and Giannulli are accused of paying $500,000 to get their two daughters into the University of Southern California as fake athletic recruits. Their daughters no longer attend USC.</p>
      <p>The couple previously pleaded not guilty to fraud and money laundering.</p>
