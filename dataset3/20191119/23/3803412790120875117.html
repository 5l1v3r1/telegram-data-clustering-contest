      <p><b>Best Answer:</b> Disney Plus (Disney+) is available on Amazon Fire TV devices and Amazon Fire tablets right now, after a few months of uncertainty. Shortly before the launch. Disney confirmed that Amazon devices would be supported.</p>
      <p>Get your Disney fix: <a href="https://www.imore.com/e?link=https%3A%2F%2Fdisneyplus.bn5x.net%2Fc%2F159229%2F705874%2F9358%3FsubId1%3DUUimUdUnU59758YYw%26subId2%3Ddim%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fpreview.disneyplus.com%252F%26ourl%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.disneyplus.com&amp;token=KIm4v6Cp">Disney+</a> (starting at $7 a month)</p>
      <h4>So I will be able to access Disney+ on my Amazon Fire devices?</h4>
      <p>Previously, Amazon Fire TV and Amazon Fire tablets were not included in the list of launch day devices. However, it was recently announced that an agreement was reached between Disney and Amazon, so Amazon Fire TV devices and Amazon Fire tablets are able to download Disney+ directly.</p>
      <p>As part of that deal, subscribers also get the opportunity to pay through Amazon. Customers can try out Disney+ for seven days free. If they decide to opt in, they can continue paying for the service through Amazon. If you've subscribed elsewhere, you can log-in with your Disney+ credentials on Amazon devices. Disney+ TV shows and movies will also be integrated into the Fire TV's universal search.</p>
      <h4>I'm getting some connection or playback issues while watching</h4>
      <p>Disney+ is a streaming service, and like the rest, you will encounter occasional hiccups with the service while you use and watch it. This involves <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-fix-connection-issues-disney">connectivity issues</a> with your internet connection, the <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/error-83-disney-plus">Disney+ servers</a>, or other <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/how-fix-playback-issues-disney-plus">playback issues</a>. Usually, any issues you have can be easily resolved by restarting devices, quitting the app and launching it again, or just checking to make sure your Internet is working. If you're having issues, make sure to check out our troubleshooting guides.</p>
      <h4>What is Disney+?</h4>
      <p>Disney+ is an entertainment streaming service from Disney. Users can access pretty much all of Disney's original and classic family-friendly content, including offerings from Marvel, Star Wars, Pixar, Fox, and National Geographic. A lot of existing Disney content has been pulled or will be removed from competing streaming services (such as Netflix) so that it's all in one place.</p>
      <p>The Disney+ service includes Disney classics, but will also have exclusive Disney+ movies and television shows, especially from the Star Wars and Marvel universes. For Marvel, there is the upcoming Loki and Wanda Vision series, and Star Wars fans are getting The Mandalorian and a new series about Obi-Wan Kenobi.</p>
      <h4>How much does Disney+ cost?</h4>
      <p>Disney+ starts at a mere $7 a month, or $70 annually. There is also a bundle deal available, where you can get Disney+, ESPN, and Hulu (with ads) for just $13 a month. It is unknown if there will be other bundles with ad-free Hulu.</p>
      <h4>When is Disney+ available?</h4>
      <p>Disney+ launched on Nov. 12, 2019 in the U.S., Canada, and the Netherlands. Austraila and New Zealand also got Disney+ on Nov. 19. It'll release on March 31, 2020 in the U.K., France, Spain, Italy, Germany, and Ireland.</p>
      <h4>All Disney, all the time</h4>
