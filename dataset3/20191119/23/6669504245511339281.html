      <p>NEW YORK - CBS won the television ratings crown last week despite being without the most valuable ratings commodity in this era, a prime-time football game.</p>
      <p>Two relatively lacklustre games on NBC and Fox last week enabled CBS' strong entertainment schedule to rule the week, the Nielsen company said. The long-running "60 Minutes" newsmagazine was CBS' top-rated program.</p>
      <p>The week's best prime-time football game was the "Monday Night Football" matchup between Seattle and San Francisco on ESPN, making it the rare week where a program on cable was the most-watched television show.</p>
      <p>CBS averaged 5.2 million viewers last week. NBC had 4.7 million viewers, ABC had 4.3 million, Fox had 3.5 million, Univision had 1.1 million, ION Television had 1 million, Telemundo had 850,000 and the CW had 610,000.</p>
      <p>ESPN was the week's most popular cable network, averaging 3.17 million viewers in prime time. In a strong news week, Fox News Channel averaged 2.75 million viewers and MSNBC had 1.96 million. Hallmark had 1.65 million viewers and HGTV had 1.04 million.</p>
      <p>ABC's "World News Tonight" topped the evening newscasts with an average of 9.1 million viewers. NBC's "Nightly News" was second with 8.4 million and the "CBS Evening News" had 6 million viewers.</p>
      <p>For the week of Nov. 11-17, the top 10 shows, their networks and viewerships: NFL Football: Seattle at San Francisco, ESPN, 16.95 million; NFL Football: Chicago at L.A. Rams, NBC, 16.85 million; NFL Football: Pittsburgh at Cleveland, Fox, 15.66 million; "60 Minutes," CBS, 13.2 million; "Sunday Night NFL Pre-Kick," NBC, 12.2 million; "NCIS," CBS, 11.66 million; "CMA Awards," ABC, 11.28 million; "NFL Pregame Show," Fox, 9.64 million; "Football Night in America, Part 3," NBC, 9.47 million; "Young Sheldon, CBS, 9.06 million.</p>
