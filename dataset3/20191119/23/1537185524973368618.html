      <p>CLOVIS, N.M. (KFDA) - A Clovis man has pleaded guilty to charges of extreme cruelty to animals.</p>
      <p>In January, the Curry County Sheriff’s Office found dead and decaying puppies and dogs at the property of 64-year-old John Davis.</p>
      <p>Officials say they also found a greyhound with a severely embedded collar.</p>
      <p>All the animals were seized, and the greyhound was taken to a veterinarian where it had to be euthanized.</p>
      <p>The remaining dogs were taken to the City of Clovis Animal Shelter.</p>
      <p>Judge Drew Tatum sentenced Davis to 18 months, suspended in favor of supervised probation. The judge also ordered that Davis pay $1,000 to the animal rescue group Cindy’s Hope for Precious Paws.</p>
      <p>He will also pay restitution to the veterinarian and was ordered not to possess any animals.</p>
      <p>Judge Tatum stated that he had been warned about the living conditions and breeding of his animals.</p>
      <p>In 2009, the sheriff’s office seized dogs from his home, and the deputies had attempted to work with him regarding his animals.</p>
