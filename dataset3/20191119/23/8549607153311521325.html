        <b>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) of the U.S. is mulling a distributed ledger technology-powered registry to accelerate the process of disaster relief payments. This was reported in a draft text of the National Advisory Council’s (NAC) November <a href="https://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/1572880188002-31454e3c26dff6922fde9d34cbe19e26/November_2019_NAC_Report_Draft_v5.pdf">report</a>, November 18, 2019.</b>

      <h3>Tapping Blockchain for Disaster Management</h3>
      <p>In a bid to speed up the cumbersome and time-consuming process of disaster relief payments, the U.S. NAC has recommended the development of a blockchain-enabled platform.</p>
      <p>Per sources close to the matter, the NAC’s draft text has requested FEMA Administrator Peter Gaynor to test the proposed initiative with a pilot project that would leverage blockchain technology to register land records. The NAC states that DLT can bring a large degree of streamlining and simplification to the process of government payouts that the affected rely on during instances of natural calamities.</p>
      <p>The draft reads in part:</p>
      <blockquote>“<b>In many disasters, such as Hurricanes Maria in Puerto Rico or Harvey in Texas, affected communities may lose the type of information needed to file a claim, such as policy documents, land ownership records, and personal identification, among others.</b>”</blockquote>
      <p>Adding:</p>
      <blockquote>“<b>By piloting a blockchain-based registry in this manner, FEMA can catalyze cross-sector engagement and develop technology-enabled use cases that can improve the speed of disaster responses and insurance claim payments, without sacrificing accuracy or increasing the risk of fraud.</b>”</blockquote>
      <p>In addition to developing a blockchain-enabled land/property registry, the NAC has also asked FEMA to partner with insurance entities to “consider making the triggering event a federal disaster declaration or the buildup to an impending threat or hazard.”</p>
      <p>According to the NAC, the aforementioned measures would allow for easier liquidation of insurance policies when the affected apply for a “disaster dividend” or “harm’s way” claim. For the uninitiated, such claims in the U.S. can be used to compensate the impacted individuals for evacuated related expenses.</p>
      <h4>Blockchain for Humanitarian Purposes</h4>
      <p>While blockchain technology can often be observed making rounds of the Wall Street and other financial hubs across the world, the list of its use-cases for humanitarian purposes is <a href="https://btcmanager.com/how-the-blockchain-could-help-to-save-lives-when-disaster-strikes/">seemingly</a> picking up the steam too.</p>
      <p>As <a href="https://btcmanager.com/fighting-global-poverty-blockchain-chocolate/?q=/fighting-global-poverty-blockchain-chocolate/&amp;">reported</a> by <i>BTCManager</i> on October 7, 2019, Dutch blockchain startup FairChain Foundation – in tandem with the United Nations Development Programme – has launched a DLT pilot to tackle global poverty.</p>
