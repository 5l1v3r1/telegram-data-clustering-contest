      <h1>Noah Baumbach Swears Ex-Wife Jennifer Jason Leigh Liked <i>Marriage Story</i></h1>

      <p>If you haven’t heard by now, <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/best-noah-baumbach-movies-ranked.html">Noah Baumbach</a>’s concept for his new movie <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/marriage-story-movie-review-noah-baumbach-divorce.html"><i>Marriage Story</i></a> didn’t come out of thin air: It’s inspired in part by <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2010/11/jennifer_jason_leigh_and_noam.html">the director’s own 2013 divorce</a> from <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2015/12/jennifer-jason-leigh-hateful-eight-quentin-tarantino.html">actress Jennifer Jason Leigh</a>. And though you’ll definitely leave the theater (or couch, once it hits Netflix) siding with one member of the film’s couple or the other (*cough* Charlie *cough*), Baumbach wants you to know there are no sides to be taken in real life. “I showed her the movie a little bit ago,” he told <i>WSJ</i> magazine of Leigh, who also read the script. “She likes it a lot.” But come on, can we ever really trust a man? Jennifer, if you’re reading this: Is that true? We can be a little more sure that Baumbach’s current partner, fellow film auteur Greta Gerwig, enjoyed the movie: “I think the first time I showed it to her, she watched it in the cutting room and sent a photo of herself crying after the opening montage,” he added. We’ll be awaiting Baumbach’s review of <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/08/little-women-trailer-with-timothe-chalamet-saoirse-ronan.html"><i>Little Women</i></a><i> </i>now.</p>
