      <h1>Juventus 'to offer two players in Paul Pogba deal'</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/juventus/"><b>Juventus</b></a> are reportedly prepared to include two players in any deal for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/"><b>Manchester United</b></a> midfielder <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/paul-pogba/"><b>Paul Pogba</b></a>.</h2>

      <p>Since the summer, Juventus and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/real-madrid/"><b>Real Madrid</b></a> have allegedly been keen to secure the signature of the Frenchman, who is keen to leave Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>United have frequently maintained that the 26-year-old, who effectively has just over two-and-a-half years left on his contract, remains not for sale.</p>
      <p>According to <i>Tuttosport</i>, Juventus may attempt to make the breakthrough by including each of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/emre-can/"><b>Emre Can</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mario-mandzukic/"><b>Mario Mandzukic</b></a> in any proposal put forward to the Premier League giants.</p>
      <p>After finding themselves down the pecking order under <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/maurizio-sarri/"><b>Maurizio Sarri</b></a>, the fringe duo have each been linked with a switch to the north-west of England in recent months.</p>
