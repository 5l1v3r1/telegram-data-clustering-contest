      <p>Taking the investigation forward in the case of a Delhi fertility clinic allegedly offering sex selection services to couples, a meeting was held with officials of the Delhi government’s health and home departments to chalk out a plan.</p>
      <p>The officials, along with the sub-divisional magistrate, collected laptops, files, CDs and other crucial documents from the Karol Bagh clinic.</p>
      <p>The clinic was sealed last month after a central investigation team raided it. The clinic would offer in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) to people in India and promise to take them to countries such as Thailand, Singapore and UAE, promising a male child.</p>
      <p>“During the meeting, it was decided that we should monitor the area and the clinic on a regular basis. It was decided to place CCTV cameras outside the clinic to ensure that services are not started again. We had asked the health department to form a special investigation team in the case; the file is yet to be approved,” said Dr Nitin Kumar, special programme officer of PC-PNDT, Delhi government.</p>
      <p>As per the complaint received by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, a team of 14 members was formed and it was decided that decoys would be used for the raid. The team found around 300 computer systems allegedly used to make calls to couples who wanted a child.The state PC-PNDT cell had said the call centre was started by an IIT graduate.</p>
