      <h1>Ireland Set To Face Slovakia Away In Euro 2020 Playoff</h1>

        <b>Ireland look set for an away trip to Slovakia in their first Euro 2020 playoff after Wales defeated Hungry to qualify automatically for the tournament.</b>
      </p>
      <p>UEFA may change Ireland into Path A from Path B if they wish to, however it is thought that they will keep the four teams in Path B as they currently are.</p>
      <p>That means that Slovakia look like Ireland’s opponents in either Bratislava or Trnava on March 26th next year, with the winners facing whichever nation is victorious when Northern Ireland take on Bosnia what is set to be the other semi-final.</p>

      <p>The game has a 50/50 chance of being in Dublin <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/soccer/ireland-set-to-face-slovakia-in-euro-2020-playoffs-1.4088808">according to The Irish Times,</a> with UEFA set to conduct a draw on Friday to determine the potential location for the final which will be played on March 31st.</p>
      <p>Slovakia away will no doubt represent a tricky task for McCarthy’s side, with Ireland’s potential opponents finishing third in their group behind Wales and Croatia and winning their final game against Azerbaijan.</p>
      <p>They won four group games, drawing one and losing three scoring 13 goals in the process while conceding 11.</p>
      <p>Ireland were denied an automatic spot in Euro 2020 <a href="https://punditarena.com/football/oisinmcqueirns2758/five-definitive-conclusions-as-ireland-fall-just-short-against-denmark/">when they drew with Denmark</a> at the Aviva Stadium on Monday night meaning it was the Danes along with Switzerland who qualified from the group.</p>
