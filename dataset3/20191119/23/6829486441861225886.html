      <h1>Meet Triple J’s New Hosts For 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T23:35:01+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 23:35</time> by <a rel="author">Jared Richards</a></address>
      <p>With triple j heavy-hitting hosts Tom Tilley, Gen Fricker and Linda Marigliano <a href="https://junkee.com/triple-j-marigliano-fricker/230628">all announcing</a> they’re leaving the station at the end of this year, the airwaves are going to sound pretty different next year. Here’s who you’ll be hearing on the airwaves in 2020.</p>
      <p>As <a href="https://junkee.com/ben-liam-triple-j-breakfast-2020/225741">previously announced</a>, <i>Weekend Arvos</i> hosts Sally &amp; Erica will take over <i>Breakfast</i> from Ben &amp; Liam, who are heading home to Adelaide to work at Nova. In the meantime, fellow FBi Radio alum Lucy Smith has been covering the 6-9am slot, and she’ll be moving over to a permanent spot manning <i>Mornings</i>, taking over from Marigliano.</p>

      <p>“I’m so unbelievably excited to spend each weekday flexing my music muscle and diving a little deeper into the tunes you’re hearing on triple j, plus the stories from the artists behind them,” Smith said in a statement. “<i>Mornings</i> is a music lover’s haven, and it’s an honour to follow in the footsteps of two of my broadcast heroes Linda Marigliano and Zan Rowe.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile,<i> Bachelor</i> podcaster Bryce Mills will take over Sally &amp; Erica’s former spot on <i>Weekend Arvos</i>.</p>
      <p>As for <i>Hack</i>, another familiar voice will take over: Avani Dias has been filling in for Tilley on-and-off all year while he’s been busy with other projects, as well as regularly hosting the show’s <i>Friday Shakeup</i>. Dias clearly has the chops for the role, recently being nominated for a Young Journalist Of The Year Walkley for <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/unsw-terror-case/10580886">a <i>Hack</i> story</a> about an UNSW student who was arrested after a colleague framed him as a terrorist.</p>
      <p>Fricker’s replacement on Lunch will be comedian Dave Woodhead, a 21-year-old Torres Strait Islander man who you might’ve spotted on <i>Get Krack!n</i> or <i>Black Comedy</i>, or heard fill in on <i>Breakfast</i> during 2019 NAIDOC week<i>.</i> “I’m looking forward to joining the triple j fam, spinning the best tunes and playing ‘Treaty’ by Yothu Yindi at every possible opportunity”, he says.</p>
      <p>Sounds good to us.</p>
