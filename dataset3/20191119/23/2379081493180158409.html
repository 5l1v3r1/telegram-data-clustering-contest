      <p>DENVER — <b>Royal Gold, Inc. (NASDAQ: RGLD) </b>(“Royal Gold” or the “Company”) today announced that its Board of Directors increased the Company’s annual calendar year dividend for its shares of common stock from $1.06 to $1.12 per share, payable on a quarterly basis of $0.28 per share. This increase represents the 19<sup>th</sup> consecutive annual increase to Royal Gold’s dividend since dividend payments began in 2000.</p>
      <p>The dividend is payable on January 17, 2020 to shareholders of record at the close of business on January 3, 2020.</p>
