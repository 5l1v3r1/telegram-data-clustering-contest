      <p>During a visit to "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/search-results/foxnews.com/category/entertainment/genres/comedy">The Tonight Show</a>," on Monday, Meyers, 45, discussed what it was like hosting the 31-year-old singer for a popular day drinking-themed segment of his show.</p>
      <p>"She was so much fun and she's the nicest person in the world," Meyers said of the pop superstar. "It was a blast."</p>

      <p>Meyer's segment, called "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3n5Pk8fkLg">Seth &amp; Rihanna Go Day Drinking</a>," aired this summer and featured the duo downing shots, beers and cocktails while making jokes and playing games.</p>

      <p>Meyers also revealed that while shooting the segment, he learned that there is one thing Rihanna -- most revered for her music, fashion design, acting and activism -- can't do very well.</p>
      <p>"She, at one point, took my phone and took a bunch of pictures while we were day drinking," the comedian offered. "When I went through and looked at them, I'm like 'Rihanna's bad at taking pictures.'"</p>

      <p>"I disagree," said "Tonight Show" host <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/jimmy-fallon-austin-students-college-tuition">Jimmy Fallon</a>, holding up an out-of-focus photo of Meyers that Rihanna snapped. "I think this is a great picture."</p>
      <p>"I think that's not a good picture," Meyers joked as the audience laughed. "I think that's poorly framed."</p>
      <p>When asked if he's now a friend of Rihanna's Meyers quickly said "no."</p>

      <p>"I think we're friendly, but I wouldn't want (her cell phone number)," revealed Meyers. "I think it would be too dangerous to have. I would spend all day thinking, 'whats a funny thing to text Rihanna?'"</p>
