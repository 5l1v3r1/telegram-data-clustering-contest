      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T23:06:16+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 23:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/express-news-service/" target="_blank">Express News Service</a></address>
      <p>Days after police in Gautam Budh Nagar filed an FIR over allegations of Home Guards faking attendance records to withdraw more salary than they are due, attendance records seized by the probe team were gutted in a fire Tuesday morning. The blaze, which broke out at the District Commandant Home Guard office, has prompted Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath to order a probe.</p>
      <p>According to police, after the FIR into the alleged scam was filed, officers had seized attendance records dating back to 2014 to ascertain the extent of the alleged scam.</p>
      <p>Police suspect the records, containing attendance information from 2014-2017, may have been destroyed on purpose. Police said that prima facie, it appears that the locks of the room, almirah and containers were broken and that more than one person may be involved.</p>
      <p>“We received information that a fire broke out in one of the rooms inside the Home Guard district office. Prima facie, it appears someone broke in. The target was the muster rolls, which contained information about the attendance of Home Guard officials. There is an ongoing case into allegations that the guards showed inflated attendance records to withdraw higher salary. A separate case has been filed for alleged destruction of evidence and investigation has begun,” said Navneet Jaiswal, SP City, Gautam Budh Nagar.</p>
      <p>In one instance, police had found that while there were 10 Home Guards at a particular police station, a request was being made for 20 and money being withdrawn accordingly.</p>
      <p>According to police, data pertaining to duty schedules of Home Guards for May-June was analysed to reveal seven police stations where the fraud may have taken place. In another instance, a Home Guard was present on duty for two-three days while the salary was withdrawn for the entire month, said police.</p>
      <p>“The CM has instructed the district magistrate and senior superintendent of police in Gautam Budh Nagar to ensure the culprits are arrested by this evening. He has also asked officials to deploy forensic teams for investigation,” said a government spokesperson in Lucknow.</p>
      <p>The alleged scam runs into lakhs, police said. A state-wide enquiry of Home Guards in every district has also been initiated by the Home Guard department. Home Guards serve as an auxiliary to the police force. They are provided daily wages.</p>
