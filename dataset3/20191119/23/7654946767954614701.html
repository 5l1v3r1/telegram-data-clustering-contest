      <h1>This hotel costs less than $1 a night — but there’s a creepy catch</h1>

      <p>Privacy doesn’t come cheap at this hotel.</p>
      <p>A Japanese hotel is offering rooms for under $1, but there’s a catch: Guests will be livestreamed during their stay.</p>
      <p>Nicknamed the “One Dollar Hotel,” a room at <a href="https://website-2466167782178721348122-hotel.business.site/?m=true">Business Ryokan Asahi</a> in Fukuoka, Japan, costs only 100 yen, or about $0.92, but part of the “price” of staying is that guests must agree to be featured on the hotel’s YouTube for 24 hours, <a href="https://www.insider.com/dollar-hotel-japan-livestreams-guests-stay-2019-11">reports Insider</a>.</p>
      <p>However, don’t expect any free X-rated voyeuristic footage from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfGp5tr2rRZCWhALrp9BBkw">hotel’s YouTube channel</a>. No nudity, sexual activity or any other “lewd acts” are allowed while staying in room No. 8. Guests are required to sign an “<a href="https://get.google.com/albumarchive/103526377688173606091/album/AF1QipOnH6uQnfU7DSysLnhYD16cv9erVFGBWVTQiVCY/AF1QipN0oqQbE8FD--DJErPyf2h56fssUGr6YvCWrJks?hl=ja">Accommodation Pledge</a>” during their stay and must get changed in the hotel’s shared bathrooms.</p>
      <p>The small room comes with a traditional Japenese tatami floor mat, a foldable sleeping mat, a small coffee table, a TV and a kettle.</p>
      <p>Livestream video does not have any sound and guests are permitted to turn off the lights, although the video cannot be turned off.</p>

      <p>As <a href="https://soranews24.com/2019/11/13/japans-cheapest-hotel-charges-just-130-yen-us1-20-for-a-room-with-a-huge-no-privacy-catch/">local Japanese site Sora News 24</a> points out, guests are not required to “give a performance or really do anything that makes for compelling viewing” during their stay, although some visitors have had fun holding up signs asking to interact with YouTube followers.</p>
      <p>The hotel says its livestreamed room isn’t a publicity stunt, but rather a way to book a room that’s rarely rented, according to a reporter who documented his stay for Sora News 24.</p>
      <p>“The management told us that room eight is the least-often booked room in the hotel, and they thought this would be a good way to convince people to stay in it,” he says.</p>
