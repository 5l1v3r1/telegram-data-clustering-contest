      <h1>Migrants found alive in refrigerated truck on Dutch-UK ferry</h1>

      <p>A ferry crew found 25 migrants in a refrigerated container on a boat sailing from the Netherlands to Britain on Tuesday, emergency services said.</p>
      <p>The cargo vessel bound for Felixstowe returned to the Dutch port of Vlaardingen, near Rotterdam, as soon as the stowaways were found, they said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The people found in the container received medical attention at the port and two were taken to hospital for further treatment for possible hypothermia.</p>
      <p>The discovery comes the month after 39 Vietnamese people were found dead in a refrigerated truck in Britain, again laying bare the risks of illegal migrant routes to Europe.</p>
      <p>"On board a ship it turned out that several people were found in a cooling container. The ship returned to the harbour," said the Rotterdam region emergency services on Twitter.</p>
      <p>"The 25 people were taken off the ship and given the medical care they need. Earlier the message came from the ship that no people died.</p>
      <p>"Two people were transported to hospital for extra medical care. Twenty-three people were transferred to a police location after a medical check-up."</p>
      <p>DFDS Seaways, which operates the cargo ferry, said that the migrants had come on board on a lorry trailer, De Telegraaf newspaper said.</p>
      <p>The driver of the truck had been arrested, it added.</p>

      <p>A bus took away the mainly male group, some of whom were wrapped in silver thermal blankets.</p>
      <p>Their nationalities were not immediately known.</p>
      <p>The mayor of Vlaardingen, Annemiek Jetten, said "more and more" people were trying to cross the Channel and had not been put off by the deaths of the Vietnamese migrants.</p>
      <p>"I think people are so desperate that they keep trying, despite the tragic events in the UK not so long ago," Jetten told broadcaster NOS.</p>
      <p>She added that it was not clear if more people were trying to get to Britain before immigration laws become tougher after its scheduled exit from the EU next year.</p>
      <p>Separately on Tuesday Dutch border police intercepted a bus carrying 65 Moldovan nationals including children who were planning to claim asylum, Dutch media reported.</p>
