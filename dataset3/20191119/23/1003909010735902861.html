      <p>Alberta Innovates, the provincially funded research and innovation agency, is eliminating up to 125 jobs as a result of government budget cuts.</p>
      <p>The agency — which had 670 employees in Edmonton, Calgary, Devon, Vegreville and Victoria, B.C., at the time of its 2019 annual report — confirmed the job cuts Tuesday. Spokesman Dwayne Brunner said in an email that Alberta Innovates’ budget for 2019-20 is just over $202 million, down from $278 million in 2018-19.</p>
      <p>“This presents a challenge and an opportunity, for us and for the whole of the provincial innovation system,” Brunner said. “We will be looking at various scenarios to align our operations with the priorities of this government and the realities of a smaller budget.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://albertainnovates.ca/">Alberta Innovates</a> offers a wide range of supports, grants and programs aimed at helping the province’s entrepreneurs in a variety of industries. According to its annual report, the agency had 1,040 clients in 2018-19 and more than 3,600 active projects. However, following its election last spring, the UCP government placed a number of these programs — including the Alberta Small Business Innovation and Research Initiative and the Alberta Entrepreneurship Incubator program — under review.</p>
      <p>Some of the 125 job losses will also come out of InnoTech Alberta, the wholly owned subsidiary of Alberta Innovates whose mandate was to facilitate the commercialization of applied research in the province. Brunner said as a result of the budget cuts, InnoTech Alberta will be shifting focus to “target greater industry investment” in innovation that offers sustained future economic upside for Alberta.</p>
      <p>Alberta Innovates remains committed to enabling Alberta’s innovators and entrepreneurs to launch and grow new ventures and develop solutions that create new jobs and opportunities for Albertans, Brunner said, and the organization’s focus right now is on the people who have been affected by the budget decisions.</p>
