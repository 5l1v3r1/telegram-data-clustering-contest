      <h1>Notts County to install two new scoreboards after significant donations</h1>
      <h2>Work set to be carried out in the New Year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T23:46:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 23:46</time> by <a rel="author">Leigh Curtis</a></address>
      <p>Notts County are to have two new scoreboards installed in January thanks to help from Lifeline and the Official Supporters’ Association.</p>
      <p>The current scoreboard is out of action due to a number of longstanding technical issues which the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/notts-county-fc">Magpies</a> has tried to resolve.</p>
      <p>But it was revealed during a fans’ forum last night that they will be replaced at <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/meadow-lane">Meadow Lane</a> in the New Year.</p>
      <p>Lifeline, a club membership scheme which raises funds to help the club's infrastructure, and the Official Supporters’ Association have donated £20,000 each while Notts will bear the other costs involved.</p>
      <p>A club statement confirmed: “We are delighted to announce that, thanks to the generosity of both Lifeline and Notts County Official Supporters’ Association, two new scoreboards will be installed at Meadow Lane in January next year.</p>

      <p>“The old scoreboard on the Haydn Green Family Stand, which has been out of action for some time, will be replaced with a new Lifeline-funded board, while the second new addition to Meadow Lane is going to be positioned centrally on the Air-IT Kop and donated by the OSA.</p>
      <p>“These welcome additions to the matchday experience will ensure supporters on all four sides of the stadium will see key information and messages before, during and after each game. <br/><br/>“We are extremely grateful to Lifeline and NCFCOSA for their magnificent fundraising efforts, allowing us to proceed with this important project.”</p>
