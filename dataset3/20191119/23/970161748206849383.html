        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/real-madrid/">Real Madrid</a> supporters are calling for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/gareth-bale/">Gareth Bale</a> to be sold after he posed with a controversial flag emblazoned with the words ‘WALES. GOLF. MADRID. IN THAT ORDER’ on Tuesday night.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Bale, 30, assisted the first of Aaron Ramsey’s two goals as Wales secured qualification for Euro 2020 with a 2-0 victory over Hungary at a raucous Cardiff City Stadium.</p>
      <p>Before the qualifier, former Madrid star Pedja Mijatovic criticised Bale for apparently prioritising golf and his country over club duties – and it was these comments which prompted the creation of the now famous flag.</p>
      <p>‘The first thing he thinks about is Wales, then golf and after that, Real Madrid,’ Mijatovic wrote in his <i>AS</i> column.</p>

      <p>Bale added fuel to the fire by admitting that representing Wales gave him more ‘joy’ than playing for Madrid ahead of Tuesday’s clash with Hungary.</p>

      <p>‘Yes definitely. It’s like playing with your mates down the park on a Sunday,’ he said.</p>
      <p>‘I’ve been with most of the older players since we were in Under-17s.</p>
      <p>‘It’s normal – with Wales, I’m speaking my own language and feel more comfortable. I definitely have a bit more excitement playing with Wales.</p>
      <p>‘But it doesn’t change what I give on the pitch. I always give 100 per cent on the pitch wherever I am.’</p>
      <p>The sight of Bale dancing with the flag – which somehow made its way down onto the pitch amid Wales’ celebrations – is hardly going to help the forward’s situation at the Bernabeu.</p>

      <p>Unsurprisingly, Madrid fans across social media reacted to Bale’s antics by calling for his time at the club to be brought to an end.</p>

      <p>Bale’s emotions got the better of him in the aftermath of Wales’ victory as he accidentally swore live on <i>Sky Sports</i> while poking fun at team-mate Ramsey.</p>
      <p>‘It’s about time he contributed. F***ing hell. No, he was brilliant tonight,’ Bale joked.</p>

      <p>‘We knew all along that this would be a tough group and it would be close so we didn’t want to get carried away from the start but now we are there.</p>
      <p>‘We had the best time of our lives in France and we can enjoy it again with these amazing fans.’</p>

      <p>On Wales’ qualification for next summer’s tournament, manager Ryan Giggs said: ‘It doesn’t get any better than this. It’s amazing.</p>
      <p>‘To come from where we were. All credit to the lads to show the determination they have.</p>
      <p>‘We always believed. And I’m just so happy we managed to do it. It’s one of the best days of my life.’</p>
