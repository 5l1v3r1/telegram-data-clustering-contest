      <p>Davie police said Walton had been charged with aggravated battery of a pregnant person.</p>
      <p>The Herald quoted a police report as saying Walton shoved his partner “against a wall and punched her several times in the head and face.”</p>
      <p>Walton has faced repeated legal issues since being picked by the Cincinnati Bengals in the 2018 NFL Draft.</p>
      <p>He was waived by the Bengals in April after being arrested three times during the off-season for offences ranging from misdemeanour marijuana possession, misdemeanour battery and unlawful possession of a firearm.</p>
      <p>He was handed a four-game suspension on November 4 for violating the NFL’s personal conduct and substance abuse policies in relation to his multiple arrests.</p>
