      <p>Any hopes that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) will cut interest rates in the near term have been dashed by signs of rising inflationary pressures.</p>
      <p>Senior Research Analyst, FXTM, Lukman Otunuga, said with the recent increase in inflation rate, the apex bank might retain existing interest rate regime over the next months.</p>
      <p>Inflation rate jumped to a 17-month high at 11.6 per cent in October 2019, from the 11.24 per cent in September 2019 due largely to rising food prices.</p>
      <p>“The CBN is unlikely to cut interest rates from 13.5 per cent this month due to the uptick in inflation and this sentiment is likely to roll over into 2020. Although one of the central bank’s objectives is to achieve price stability, an interest rate cut has the potential to stimulate consumption which accounts for roughly 80 per cent of Gross Domestic Products (GDP),” Otunuga said.</p>
      <p>He added that given how the Federal Reserve has signalled a pause on further rate cuts, this may also complicate the CBN’s efforts to ease monetary policy in 2020.</p>
      <p>The next major economic release from the Nigerian economy will be the third-quarter GDP figures scheduled for release on Monday November 25, 2019.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>“Markets are predicting growth to expand 2.0 per cent during third quarter. Should the report disappoint, the CBN could be forced to take action despite the threat of rising inflation,” Otunuga said.</p>
      <p>According to him, rising inflationary pressures are certainly weakening the case for the Central Bank of Nigeria to cut interest rates from 13.5 per cent anytime soon.</p>
      <p>He noted that should inflation accelerate more than expected, the apex bank is likely to leave interest rates unchanged throughout the first quarter of 2020.</p>
      <p>He however argued that although the CBN governor has stated that inflation must slow to nine per cent or less before examining a rate cut, signs of economic weakness due to low oil prices and external risks could force the central bank to take action.</p>
      <p>He said a combination of trade uncertainty and global growth concerns have the potential to accelerate the flight to safety, consequently boosting appetite for safe-haven assets like the Dollar at the expense of emerging markets like Nigeria.</p>
