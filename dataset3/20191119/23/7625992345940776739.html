      <p>A 16-year-old U.S. citizen was arrested Sunday after he attempted to use a remote-controlled car to <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cocaine-worth-more-than-1-million-found-hidden-in-banana-shipments-in-washington/">smuggle</a> methamphetamine across the U.S.-Mexico border. The bundle is estimated to be worth more than $100,000.</p>
      <p>Agents with <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/border-wall-smugglers-are-sawing-through-the-border-wall-but-officials-say-its-not-an-issue-2019-11-02/">U.S. Customs and Border Protection</a>Â (CBP) stationed in San Diego saw a person with duffel bags walking along the secondary border wall. Other agents responded to the scene and found the suspect hiding in thick brush near the border.</p>

      <p>When an agent approached the boy, he had a remote-controlled car and two large duffel bags in his possession. The agent questioned the boy and searched his bags, discovering he is a 16-year-old U.S citizen.</p>
      <p>The agent found 50 packages of <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/psa-gaffe-or-genius-slogan-twitter-divides-over-south-dakotas-new-anti-meth-ad/">methamphetamine</a> and arrested the teen on drug smuggling charges. CBP said the 55.84-pound bundle has an estimated value of $106,096.</p>

      <p>"I am extremely proud of the agents' heightened vigilance and hard work in stopping this unusual smuggling scheme," San Diego Sector Chief Patrol Agent Douglas Harrison <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/local-media-release/smuggler-uses-remote-controlled-car-transport-meth">said in a press release Tuesday</a>.</p>
      <p>This isn't the first time a remote-controlled device was used to attempt to transport drugs across the border. <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/local-media-release/smuggler-using-drone-busted-border-patrol">According to CBP</a>, a 25-year-old man was arrested for flying a remote-controlled drone carrying 12 packages of meth across the border in 2017.</p>
