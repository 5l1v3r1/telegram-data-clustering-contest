      <h1>Tom Hanks just found out he’s related to Mister Rogers</h1>

      <p>(CNN) — <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/11/entertainment/tom-hanks-mister-rogers/index.html">Tom Hanks</a> is taking getting into character to a whole new level. He’s actually related to one.</p>
      <p>Hanks just found out Sunday that he’s related to Fred Rogers, who played <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/23/us/mister-rogers-pennsylvania-143-day-trnd/index.html">Mister Rogers</a> on the children’s TV show.</p>
      <p>The two are sixth cousins, Ancestry.com discovered. “It all just comes together, you see,” Hanks told Access Hollywood when the show informed him of the relation.</p>
      <p>Here’s why it’s especially notable: Hanks is playing Mister Rogers in the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/28/entertainment/tom-hanks-mister-rogers-movie/index.html">upcoming film</a>, “A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.” He says he didn’t know they were related when he took the role.</p>
      <p>Ancestry figured out the two are sixth cousins, and their common ancestor was Johannes Meffert. Their subsequent ancestors had the last name of Mefford.</p>
      <p>“Fred Rogers and Tom Hanks are sixth cousins sharing the same 5x great-grandfather … who immigrated from Germany to America in the 18th century,” Ancestry spokeswoman Keri Madonna told CNN on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Hanks and Rita Wilson, his wife, couldn’t believe the news.</p>
      <p>“No, impossible! You’re pulling our leg,” Wilson said when Access Hollywood told the duo.</p>
      <p>Many fans have said Hanks makes a perfect Mister Rogers, and perhaps this is why.</p>
      <p>The film premieres November 22.</p>
