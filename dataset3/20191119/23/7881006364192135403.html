      <p><b>Hyderabad: </b>The Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC) Employees Joint Action Committee (JAC) on Tuesday decided to continue its strike till the labour court pronounces its decision on the legality of the strike.</p>
      <p>The central committees of all the trade unions in the JAC had convened meetings independently here Hyderabad on Tuesday.  Later in the evening, the leaders of all the unions met under the JAC leadership to discuss the ongoing issues and the future course of action. A majority number of the leaders opined that the strike has to continue until they received a positive response from either the labour court or from the state government.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Some leaders were apprehensive that if the workers call off the strike and want to resume the duty, the corporation may raise objections, which could create problems for the workers.</p>
      <p>Later, JAC convener E. Ashwathama Reddy, speaking to the media, said “Within a couple of days, the JAC will announce about further decisions. Until such time, the strike will continue. We will take into consideration various aspects, including judgment of the High Court, seeking legal opinions and options, and the labour court’s ruling on the strike. All the unions have discussed the issues and would stick to the decision of the JAC on the strike."</p>
      <p>He said, “we have not received the copy of the High Court judgment yet. Lawyers and legal experts will be consulted after the copy is received."</p>
      <p>Responding to a query, Reddy said that none of workers are pressurising the JAC to call off the strike as they had confidence in JAC leadership’s decisions, which were meant for the overall good of the employees.</p>
