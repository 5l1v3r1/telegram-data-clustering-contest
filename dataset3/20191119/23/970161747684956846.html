      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a> Hotspur are confident of appointing <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jose-mourinho/">Jose Mourinho</a> as their new manager on Wednesday after the Portuguese coach accepted the club’s offer to replace <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/mauricio-pochettino/">Mauricio Pochettino</a>.</p>
      <p>The 56-year-old has been out of work since being sacked by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a> in December 2018 and he’s been working as a pundit for Sky Sports as he waits for an opportunity to return to management.</p>
      <p>Mourinho made it clear that his preference was remaining in England and he was recently linked with replacing Unai Emery at Arsenal.</p>
      <p>However, Spurs’ shock decision has opened up the possibility of joining another top six club and Sky Sports News report Mourinho’s representatives met with the club late on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>It’s claimed the talks were at an advanced stage and that Mourinho could be announced as Pochettino’s replacement on Wednesday after he agreed to take charge.</p>

      <p>Pochettino leaves Spurs with a 55% win percentage and the club will pay him £12m in compensation given he was only 18 months into a new deal.</p>

      <p>Mourinho showed interest in Harry Kane, Eric Dier, Toby Alderweireld and Danny Rose while manager at Manchester United but he faces an uphill task in getting the club to finish in the top fou.</p>
      <p>Spurs are currently 14th and sit just six points above the relegation zone. They’re 11 points off Manchester City, who currently occupy the last spot in the top four.</p>
      <p>Should Mourinho be announced on Wednesday, he’s likely to take charge of Spurs’ match against West Ham at the Olympic Stadium on Saturday.</p>
