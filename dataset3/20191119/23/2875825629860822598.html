      <h1>Mauricio Pochettino's assistant manager sends heartfelt message to Tottenham fans after axe</h1>
      <h2>Tottenham axed Mauricio Pochettino - along with assistant Jesus Perez and coaches Miguel D'Agostino and Antoni Jimenez - on Tuesday night</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T23:00:03+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 23:00</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Mauricio Pochettino's assistant Jesus Perez has paid tribute to Tottenham supporters - just hours after his heartbreaking sacking.</p>
      <p>Spurs have axed Pochettino - along with right-hand man Perez and coaches Miguel D'Agostino and Antoni Jimenez - less than six months after he took the club to the Champions League final.</p>
      <p>The Argentine boss has ultimately paid the price for a poor run of domestic form in 2019, bringing an end to a five-and-a-half-year spell at the club.</p>
      <p>Pochettino joined from <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> in 2014 and delivered four top-four finishes across his five full seasons in charge - but leaves with Spurs 14th in the Premier League and having won only three of their opening league games.</p>

      <p>Perez, though, holds no hard feelings and was quick to praise the Spurs faithful.</p>
      <p>He wrote on <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> : "COYS. Thank you from our heart to our players, staff, and special thanks to you all, lovely Spurs Fans" - and accompanied his post with a 'heartbroken' emoji.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> defender Toby Alderweireld, meanwhile, said the news of Pochettino's sacking was a shock to him.</p>
      <p>"It's a surprise for me as well," he told Sky Sports after Belgium's Euro 2020 qualifying win over Cyprus. "I think the club made a decision and we have to accept this.</p>

      <p>"I think we have to be very thankful to him, for what he achieved, he brought this club to the next level."</p>
      <p>The centre-back said he expected Spurs to bring in a "big manager" to replace Pochettino.</p>
      <p>Spurs say they will announce their new coaching staff "in due course", with former <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> manager Jose Mourinho an early favourite to take the reins.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese is admired by Levy, who has tried to appoint him in the past, and Mourinho has always spoken positively about Spurs. He has been seen watching some of their games this season.</p>

      <p>If Mourinho is the man to replace Pochettino, he may have to work under financial constraints that he is not used to.</p>
      <p>While Spurs have competed at the top end of the Premier League for the last four seasons, they have not matched their rivals in the spending department.</p>
      <p>They became the first ever Premier League side not to make a signing during the summer transfer window in 2018 and then followed that up with another blank window in January.</p>
