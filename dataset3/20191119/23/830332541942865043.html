      <p>MADISON, Wis. - The Forward Madison FC soccer team is giving fans the chance to name one of the new flamingos at Henry Vilas Zoo.</p>
      <p>According to a news release from Tuesday, the name will be decided through an online contest.</p>
      <p>The contest comes after the zoo announced it will be adding <a href="https://www.channel3000.com/news/henry-vilas-zoo-adding-new-flamingos-bison/1143364935">five flamingos and a bison this winter</a>. The soccer team's Twitter page received a number of name suggestions after asking fans in a post. </p>
      <p>Those who would like to share their name ideas can submit suggestions to the <a href="https://www.forwardmadisonfc.com/news_article/show/1065948">Forward Madison website</a>. Suggestions will be narrowed down to a final public vote.</p>
      <p>The winner will receive a prize, and the actual flamingo will have a pink leg band tied to it with its new name.</p>
