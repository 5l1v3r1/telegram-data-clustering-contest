        <li>Microsoft fixed an issue resulting in the Other People section under Storage Settings not displaying the correct size used.</li>

        <li>Microsoft fixed an issue that could result in the Photos app crashing when interacting with HEVC images.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Knowns issues</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>BattlEye and Microsoft have found incompatibility issues due to changes in the operating system between some Insider Preview builds and certain versions of BattlEye anti-cheat software. To safeguard Insiders who might have these versions installed on their PC, Microsoft have applied a compatibility hold on these devices from being offered affected builds of Windows Insider Preview. <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4526620/updating-to-some-windows-insider-preview-builds-on-devices-with-certai">See this article for details</a>.</li>

        <li>Microsoft has heard that Settings still isn’t available outside of launching via the URI (ms-settings:) for some Insiders and are investigating.</li>
        <li>Some Insiders are reporting that after successfully installing printer drivers from the Optional Updates section, the same driver is still showing as available for install. Microsoft has looking into the issue.</li>
        <li>Microsoft has looking into reports of certain external USB 3.0 drives not responding with Start Code 10 or 38 after they’re attached.</li>
      </ul>
