      <p>Nine homes have been raided across Greater Manchester as part of a police investigation into illegal puppy breeding.</p>
      <p>101 dachshunds were seized after a complaint led to a two month probe into unlicensed puppy sales.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dogs/">dogs</a> are now under the care of the RSPCA while police interrogate a number of individuals.</p>
      <p>The dogs were seized in Rochdale, Oldham and Salford.</p>
      <p>Rochdale Council urged people who have bought a dachshund locally within in the last year to contact the authority.</p>
      <p>Mark Widdup, director of neighbourhoods, said: ‘It is really pleasing we have been able to execute the warrants successfully and place the dogs into care’.</p>
