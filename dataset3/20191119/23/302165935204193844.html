      <p>CARDIFF, Nov 20 ― Wales reached their second straight European Championship finals after a goal in each half by midfielder Aaron Ramsey gave them a 2-0 home win over Hungary in their decisive Group E qualifier today.</p>
      <p>The Welsh, who reached the Euro 2016 semi-finals, finished runners-up on 14 points from eight games, three behind Croatia who sealed their berth on Saturday with a 3-1 win over Slovakia.</p>
      <p>Having previously gone 58 years without reaching a major tournament after the 1958 World Cup, there were joyous scenes at the Cardiff City Stadium as Wales produced a dominant display to wrap up qualification.</p>
      <p>The outcome was a triumph for manager Ryan Giggs, who never kicked a ball at a World Cup or European Championship as a player but can now revel in guiding his country to Euro 2020 after taking over from Chris Coleman in January 2018.</p>
      <p>Former Manchester United winger Giggs, who won 13 Premier League titles and two Champions League trophies with the club, was delighted.</p>
      <p>“It doesn't get any better, it's amazing,” Giggs was quoted as saying by the BBC.</p>
      <p>“From where we were in the summer, all credit to the lads for coming back. One of the best days of my life.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>First blood</b>
      </p>
      <p>Both sides needed victory to progress and Wales drew first blood when Ramsey rose to head home from six metres in the 15th minute after a perfect Gareth Bale cross from the right.</p>
      <p>With Hungary pressing for an equaliser, goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey made a crucial double save in the 34th minute when he parried a Dominik Szoboszlai shot from eight metres and then smothered Roland Sallai’s follow up.</p>
      <p>Ramsey, who tore Hungary's midfield apart with crisp passing, struck again in the 47th with a close-range drive into the top corner after Kieffer Moore scrambled a Ben Davies free kick into his path.</p>
      <p>Hungary were fortunate not to concede more goals as Daniel James curled a shot from the edge of the penalty area inches wide before Hungary keeper Peter Gulacsi denied Ramsey a hat-trick with a reflex save.</p>
      <p>Ramsey, who had struggled at club and international level since his close-season move from Arsenal to Juventus, hoped for a campaign similar to the one in 2016 when the Welsh emerged as the tournament's surprise package.</p>
      <p>“We had the best time of our lives in France (at Euro 2016) so we wanted to make sure we got there again,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I missed a lot of this campaign but I've chipped in now and it's worthwhile.”</p>
      <p>Bale added: “It's about time he contributed! He's a world class player, it's great to have him back and his goals helped us through.</p>
      <p>“We have been getting better throughout the campaign and this is where we want to be. We will go there and have some fun again.”</p>
      <p>The Hungarians will have another chance to reach next year's 24-nation tournament via the playoffs and so will Slovakia, who beat Azerbaijan 2-0 at home in the group's other fixture.</p>
      <p>The Slovakians needed Wales and Hungary to draw in order to progress with a win against the Azeris but goals from Robert Bozenik and Marek Hamsik turned out to be a mere consolation in light of a magnificent Welsh performance. ― Reuters</p>
