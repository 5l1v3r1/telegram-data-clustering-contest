      <p>The Alberta government is calling on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to immediately recall Parliament and enact legislation forcing striking Canadian National Railway Co. employees back to work.</p>
      <p>Provincial Energy Minister Sonya Savage and Agriculture Minister Devin Dreeshen made the request Tuesday, less than 12 hours after conductors and rail yard operators at Canada’s largest railway walked off the job. The union and the railway failed to reach an agreement over issues including working conditions and drug benefits.</p>
      <p>Historically, rail strikes haven’t lasted long as the federal government has typically been quick to enforce back-to-work legislation. However, this time, Parliament is not scheduled to convene until Dec. 5, which could delay the process.</p>
      <p>Savage told reporters that even a short wait could result in serious damage to the Alberta economy, as CN ships more than 170,000 barrels of western Canadian oil each day.</p>
      <p>“We’re very concerned . . . we’re already under extreme capacity constraints because of the failure to build pipelines,” Savage said. “The entire economy of Alberta and Canada could be extremely impacted by the failure to move, not only our energy products, but every single product.”</p>
      <p>Dreeshen said the strike is particularly worrisome in farm country, where producers have already been grappling with a difficult harvest plagued by weather delays and the ongoing trade dispute with China that has cost Canadian canola growers their largest market.</p>
      <p>“They’ve had a very difficult year this year and a bottleneck in our rail system is something we’ve seen before on the Prairies,” Dreeshen told reporters. “Once those shipments start to stop and get delayed it piles up like a snowball. It has ripple effects and it has lasting effects . . . at the end of the day, farmers pay all those contract delays.”</p>
      <p>Tom Steve, general manager of the Alberta Wheat Commission and Alberta Barley, said the timing of the CN strike will leave a bad taste in the mouths of those farmers who have half this year’s crop still sitting out on snow-covered fields.</p>

      <p>“It’s like, ‘What else can go wrong this year?’ ” Steve said, adding he supports any measure that would quickly get striking rail workers back to work. “If we go to Dec. 5, it would be catastrophic for western Canadian farmers. The government needs to find some sort of solution, and if it’s not recalling Parliament, they need to find some other way of getting in there and getting the grain pipeline moving.”</p>
      <p>In an emailed statement, Ben Brunnen — vice-president with the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers — said the organization will be monitoring the situation to assess potential effects on Canada’s global competitiveness.</p>
      <p>“The oil industry is concerned about any developments that can negatively impact the availability of rail capacity, particularly in light of the current shortage of available pipeline capacity relative to oil production in Western Canada,” Brunnen said.</p>

      <p>The government of Saskatchewan, along with federal Opposition Leader Andrew Scheer, also urged Trudeau to move quickly to put an end to the strike.</p>
      <p>“For farmers in Alberta, Saskatchewan and across Canada, every day counts. They need to move their product to markets now,” Scheer said Tuesday afternoon on Twitter. “I join the Alberta government’s call for Justin Trudeau to immediately recall Parliament to enact emergency legislation and get the CN Rail shipments moving.”</p>
      <p>Workers at CN have been without a contract since July and served a strike notice on Saturday. The Teamsters Canada Rail Conference union said that workers are being forced to operate trains alone from outside the locomotive, hanging on to moving trains with one hand and working a remote-control device in the other, creating a safety hazard. The union is also balking at a lifetime cap on prescription drug coverage and said the company is making it more difficult to take time off and work longer hours.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, the Montreal-based railway said it had offered the union binding arbitration and the union declined.</p>
      <p>Federal Labour Minister Patty Hajdu said in a statement Tuesday that she supports and has faith in the collective bargaining process.</p>
      <p>“The Government of Canada understands the importance of the rail industry and its workers to the Canadian economy. While we are concerned about the impact of a work stoppage on Canadians, we remain hopeful they will reach an agreement,” Hajdu said.</p>
