      <p>Youth dominates the Buffalo Bills' tight end meeting room, thanks to the presence of two rookies on the 53-man roster and one on the practice squad.</p>
      <p>You'd think that might make the job of tight ends coach Rob Boras more difficult, but he relishes it.</p>
      <p>"The energy that they bring every day has really re-energized the entire room," Boras said of Dawson Knox, Tommy Sweeney and practice-squad member Nate Becker. "We have great veteran leadership with Lee (Smith) and Tyler (Kroft), but these (rookies) come to work every day with the vigor of 22-, 23-, 24-year-olds. It's refreshing. This is my 16th year in the league, and just to have that 'every day is a new day' and they're going to attack that day attitude makes me feel like I'm doing this for the first time again.</p>
      <p>"Sometimes, no matter what you do in your career, you need to have that kind of re-energized (feeling)."</p>
      <p>Energy is good. So is the guidance of a ninth-year veteran such as Smith, who Boras describes as "a big brother and a father to those guys wrapped up in one, especially as far as helping them with all the off-the-field things, how to be a pro, how to take care of your body, how to get ready for a Sunday game or a Thursday game."</p>
      <p>Success in games is even better. The Bills' offense, by design, calls for tight ends to make a significant contribution.</p>
      <p>It hasn't always been pretty. Smith has been frequently penalized. Knox had a key drop in the 19-16 loss to the Cleveland Browns on Nov. 10.</p>
      <p>But the offense had its best showing of the season in the 37-20 victory over the Miami Dolphins Sunday, and the tight ends contributed significantly. Knox, the Bills' third-round draft pick from Mississippi, caught a 23-yard touchdown pass. It was his second scoring reception of the year.</p>
      <p>The third-down play was an example of how quickly Knox has grasped the concept that players sometimes need to think outside of how plays are diagrammed and rehearsed in practice. Knox was supposed to run a 12-yard pattern before turning toward quarterback Josh Allen.</p>
      <p>However, the tight end could see that the Dolphins were going to be attacking Allen with an aggressive "blitz zero," so he looked back at the QB at 7 yards.</p>
      <p>"If he ran it by the letter of the law and waited to 12 yards, we're probably sacked or the ball's going somewhere else," Boras said. "So it's not only knowing what to do, but more importantly, knowing how to do it and doing it at the right time. With some guys, it takes years. I had (Carolina Panthers tight end) Greg Olsen as a rookie (with the Chicago Bears), and Greg was another guy that could function like that. And Dawson's done a nice job with those opportunities. It's never perfect, but he does learn from his mistakes and is moving on."</p>
      <p>The coach describes Knox, Sweeney and Becker as "very intelligent young men" in and out of football. He's especially impressed with their ability to process information.</p>
      <p>"There's a difference between being able to learn it and regurgitate it, and learn it and be able to go react," Boras said. "And these three -- especially Dawson and Tommy because they've been the ones that have seen the (playing) time -- they can take it from the classroom to the field. I don't care what position you are, that's hard to do, where they don't need to have maybe all the additional walk-through reps and they can process the verbal information and get able to go out there and function at a level.</p>
      <p>"Now, is it a good enough level all the time? No, but they're not making mental errors, and that's been the biggest thing. They're running the right routes, they're blocking the correct guys. It doesn't mean that they're going to win every time, but their being in the right place at the right time gives us a chance."</p>
      <p>Sweeney, a seventh-round choice from Boston College, has been inactive for the past five games.</p>
      <p>Despite that, Boras is effusive in his praise for Sweeney.</p>
      <p>"He has exceeded any expectation and every expectation that I had," the coach said. "He recognizes what his weaknesses are right now, and he's determined to go out there and find a way -- pre-practice, post-practice -- to try to get better. In the last five weeks that he's been inactive, I think he'd tell you that he's gotten better . . . which ultimately is what it has to be. We need him to continue to develop to be a good player, whether it's soon for us or whether it's later for us."</p>
      <p>Tyler Kroft, signed as a free agent in the offseason from the Cincinnati Bengals, is another tight end on the 53-man roster whose contributions have been limited. Kroft was sidelined after re-breaking his foot during offseason workouts. He has played in the last five games after being inactive through the first five.</p>
      <p>"He really went from October to October without playing any football," Boras said. "We go through all those (offseason practices) just to get ready to play a game. He went out and had about two padded practices and maybe six total practices, and all of a sudden you're going to go compete at the ultimate highest level? It takes a second to get your legs back underneath you.</p>
      <p>"We all need to continue to build our confidence, one in ourselves. 'Am I going to get hurt again?' And then, as soon as you start creating that confidence in yourself, then you start to play a little bit bigger and stronger and faster. I don't want to speak for Tyler, but I would think he would say he's not where he knows he can be, but he's going in the correct direction. He did some really good things for us Sunday in the run game."</p>
