      <p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/aubrey-oday/">Aubrey O’Day</a> posted a brand new Instagram update today, and it showed her striking a sexy pose. She was seen spreading her legs, as she sat with her knees up and her toes pointed towards the ground. The singer wore a black teddy, which featured a triangular cut-out below her chest. It had thin straps and a low v-cut neckline, so her cleavage was on full display. The teddy also had textured accents throughout. In addition to the lingerie, Aubrey wore a silver jacket on top. It had extra-large and pronounced shoulders, along with sides that billowed down behind her. She maintained the symmetry of the shot by placing her hands on the sides of her knees.</p>
      <p>The Danity Kane singer slicked her hair down in a middle part, and gave a sultry look. Her hair looked like she gelled it down. She tilted her head up slightly, as she parted her lips. Her lipstick was light pink and shimmery, while her eyeshadow was metallic silver. Her dark eyeliner also popped in the shot.</p>
      <p>This update also had another dimension to it, which is that it was Photoshopped to make it appear as though Aubrey was straddling the moon. The backdrop was navy blue, with a white moon on the bottom. Above the <i>Ex on the Beach</i> star were yellow stars, along with white dots. It was animated with a video filter too, which made the backdrop appear to be sparkling. The geotag added to the theme, as she noted that it was taken in “OuterSpace.”</p>

      <p>Fans left tons of compliments for the stunner in the comments section.</p>
      <p>“Divine,” declared a follower.</p>
      <p>“Hot hot hot hot,” raved an admirer.</p>
      <p>“Love you to the moon and back My beautiful queen,” gushed a fan.</p>

      <p>“Hope those voices also tell you to release a second solo record!” exclaimed a fourth Instagram user, referring to her captions.</p>
      <p>Aubrey’s latest album, <i>Between Two Evils</i>, was released in August 2013. So it has been a while since fans have been able to enjoy new tracks.</p>
      <p>In addition, the singer shared a photo in mid-July that showed her spreading her legs. This time, she <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5544617/aubrey-oday-straddles-crown-floaty-wearing-cleavage-baring-gold-bikini/">straddled</a> a crown-shaped floatie while laying on her back. Aubrey wore a yellow bikini, as she played with the long straps with her hands. She glanced up at the camera with a sultry look. She used a filter that made it appear as though she was wearing a crown on her head. The bombshell completed her look with a pair of boots.</p>
