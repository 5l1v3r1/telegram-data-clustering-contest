      </p>
      <p>Some members of staff of Ekiti State University, Ado Ekiti, were jittery on Monday over the  alleged plans by the school  to sack no fewer than  500 workers.</p>
      <p>Workers, who spoke to our correspondent on condition of anonymity,  alleged that  the university had decided  to sack those  employed by the immediate past Vice-Chancellor, Prof Samuel Oye Bandele.</p>
      <p>They also alleged that “some professors, who were promoted during  the period  may  be demoted over  the allegations that due process was not followed when they were promoted”.</p>
      <p>One of the workers  said the university management and council had consistently complained of  a bloated workforce and the need to downsize.</p>
      <p>The source said, “The management will soon issue sack letters to over 500 workers  because of  the complains that the university is overstaffed.</p>
      <p>“We have been notified and any moment from now,  letters  will be distributed and this has been creating panic  in the university.”</p>
      <p>But the Head, EKSU Directorate of Information, Bode Olofinmuagun, denied the school was planning to sack workers.</p>
      <p> He said, “The management has no plan to sack nor demote any worker.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“There is no tension on campus over the  issue. I am on campus as I speak with you. The university is peaceful and I am not aware of any plan like that.”</i>
