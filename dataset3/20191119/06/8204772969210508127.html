      <p><b>Ladies’ All-Ireland Club Football Finals</b><br/>Those brave enough to brace the chilly wintry conditions this weekend can expect a feast of football for their efforts. In the intermediate final St Paul’s (Antrim) will take on Naomh Ciarán (Offaly) in Kingspan Breffni, Cavan on Saturday at 2.30pm while the heavyweights of Mourneabbey (Cork) and Kilkerrin-Clonberne (Galway) will contest the senior final in Limerick’s Gaelic Grounds at 5.00pm. If spectators still want more CL MacHale Rovers (Mayo) play Donoughmore (Cork) in the junior final on Sunday in Duggan Park, Ballinasloe at 2pm.<br/><b>Where</b>: Multiple venues<br/><b>When</b>: Saturday and Sunday, November 23rd–24th</p>
      <p><b>Ireland (vs Scotland) – Women’s Six Nations</b><br/>2019 hasn’t been a vintage year for the Irish women’s rugby team. A single win was all they could muster during the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/six-nations">Six Nations</a> and a loss against Wales in their sole November international only compounded their struggle for form. But every February constructs a new well of hope and Scotland, the only side Ireland beat last spring, could provide the side with just the confidence they need as they begin a new campaign.<br/><b>Where:</b> Energia Park, Donnybrook<br/><b>When:</b> Sunday, February 2nd</p>
      <p><b>Republic of Ireland (vs Greece) – 2021 Women’s European Championship Qualification</b><br/>It was a late volley that cruelly denied the Republic of Ireland full points from a trip to Athens last Tuesday afternoon. But it was far from a disaster and Vera Pauw’s side are still in with a significant chance of qualifying for the 2021 tournament. Their next game is another duel with the Greeks where they will be hoping to get back to winning ways in their South Dublin fortress.<br/><b>Where</b>: Tallaght Stadium<br/><b>When:</b> Friday, March 6th</p>
      <p><b>Vhi Women’s Mini Marathon</b><br/>Sport is a participatory as well as an observatory exercise, and the event dubbed as “largest all-women’s event of its kind in the world” is just the event to ensure you kickstart the summer with a clean bill of health. Entries open in the New Year with the entrance fee set at €25.00. For more information about the event visit www.vhiwomensminimarathon.ie<br/><b>Where:</b> Dublin City<br/><b>When:</b> Sunday, May 31st</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Arnold+Palmer">Arnold Palmer</a> Cup</b><br/>It’s the only event on this list that is not female-only, yet it’s worthy of inclusion for the sheer originality of the concept. Male and female collegiate students will play together on the legendary Clare links course in the Ryder Cup-style competition between the USA and an International team. The tournament only expanded in 2018 to include female participants but, thus far, it has been a fine success.<br/><b>Where:</b> <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=Lahinch">Lahinch</a> Golf Course<br/><b>When:</b> Friday, July 3rd – Sunday, July 5th</p>
