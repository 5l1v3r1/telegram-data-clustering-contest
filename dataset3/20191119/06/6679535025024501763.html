      <p>Following an outrage from military veterans and many Parliamentarians over the new uniform of marshals, Rajya Sabha Chairman Venkaiah Naidu on Tuesday said that the Secretariat would revisit the design.</p>
      <p>Mr. Naidu said he had received <a href="http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/parliament-proceedings-rajya-sabha-marshals-uniform-goes-military-green/article30009328.ece">objections about the new dress code from political leaders</a> and some “well-meaning persons”. “I have decided to ask the Rajya Sabha Secretariat to revisit the same and take it forward,” he said.</p>
      <p>The military veteran community on Monday had expressed concern and anguish on social media on the striking resemblance of the uniform of the marshals who flank the Chairman’s chair to a military uniform complete with its peak cap and lanyard.</p>
      <p>On the 250th session of Rajya Sabha, the marshals came wearing new olive green uniform in place of the safari suits they wore during the summer months and Indian ‘bandhgalas’ during the winter along with turban. The peak cap with two oak leaves resembles that of a Colonel and above. There is also the red band, Army officials said.</p>
      <p>The Rajya Sabha members too were taken by surprise. Congress MP Jairam Ramesh raised the issue but was not allowed to complete his statement. “Sir the Marshals...” to which Mr. Naidu immediately retorted, “We are in the midst of a condolence motion.” Not willing to let go, Mr. Ramesh said “But this is a very significant change.” Mr. Naidu, however, stalled any further discussion on the issue, saying “You always make insignificant points at such a significant time.”</p>
      <p>Speaking to <i>The Hindu</i>, Mr. Ramesh later said, “It seems 'marshal' law has been imposed in Rajya Sabha.” He will be raising the issue again in Parliament. Sources said that many BJP MPs too are planning to raise the issue in Rajya Sabha in the coming days.</p>
      <p>RJD MP Manoj K. Jha described the change in uniform as bizarre. “A military uniform doesn’t have place in Parliament,” he said.</p>
      <p>BJP MPs too have objected to the uniform. Senior officials at the Rajya Sabha Secretariat said that the uniform was designed in-house without help of any outside institute. And the change was brought about on the demand of the marshals themselves.</p>
