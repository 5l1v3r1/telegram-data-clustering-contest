      <h2>Jerez could become the next Spanish GP host.</h2>

      <p>For 2020, Spain is only remaining on the calendar because Barcelona concluded eleventh-hour negotiations for a single-year deal that involved pushing out the calendar to an unprecedented 22 races.</p>
      <p>But for 2021, there could be a change of venues.</p>
      <p>Citing local sources, newspapers El Mundo Deportivo and Marca claim that Jerez - which was the scene of the climactic finale of the 1997 season - is in talks with Liberty Media about a three-year deal for 2021-2023.</p>
      <p>Reportedly, an agreement in principle may already have been signed for a $25 million annual fee, payable by the regional government Junta de Andalucia.</p>
      <p>The news reportedly follows a meeting in London between Spanish officials and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/chase-carey/"><b>Chase Carey</b></a>.</p>
      <p>Jerez de la Frontera mayor Mamen Sanchez said she regrets that the information has leaked into the public.</p>
      <p>"The council has been working for two years so that Formula 1 returns to Jerez," she told Diario de Jerez newspaper.</p>
      <p>"I want to issue a reminder that we have a confidentiality agreement and I hope and wish that any ambition to tell the news does not frustrate the negotiations," Sanchez added.</p>
