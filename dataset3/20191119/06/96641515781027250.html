      <h1>Facebook quietly released a meme creation app called Whale</h1>
      <h2>The experimental app was built by the company's NPE Team.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T06:02:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 06:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.engadget.com/editors/nick-summers" target="_blank">Nick Summers</a></address>
      <p>The internet is built on glorious, glorious memes. It's no surprise, therefore, that Facebook wants to own the creation of these wonderful jokes alongside messaging, photo-sharing and everything else that's currently part of the Zuckerberg empire. As <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/12ecc6"><i>The Information</i> reports</a>, the company's internal NPE team has quietly released a meme-making app called Whale <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/whale-meme-creator/id1482865335">in the Canadian App Store</a>. You can upload your own photos or choose from the company's stock library before adding a hopefully-viral combination of text, emojis and filters. Whale also comes with various grid layouts and, if you're feeling really creative, a freeform drawing tool.</p>
      <p>NPE (which stands for New Product Experimentation) was set up <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/07/09/facebook-npe-new-product-experimentation-team/">a few months back</a> to work on, you guessed it, experimental Facebook apps. The team's previous efforts include <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/bump/id1474661920">Bump</a>, a chat app that helps strangers connect over simple ice breaker questions, and <a href="https://musically.com/2019/11/11/facebooks-experimental-apps-team-launches-aux-music-app/">Aux</a>, a group listening app that lets you pick songs and compete for their group's virtual auxiliary cable. All three applications are targeting younger smartphone owners -- the type who are currently obsessed with TikTok and Twitch. While the Instagram team <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/12/instagram-reels-scenes-video-editing-tiktok/">adds TikTok-inspired features</a> to its app, it makes sense for Facebook to place a few smaller and arguably more original bets on mobile.</p>
      <p>Will Whale ever be released worldwide? We wouldn't bet on it. Facebook is quick to launch experimental apps and even quicker to shut them down (<a href="https://www.engadget.com/2015/12/07/rip-facebook-creative-labs-slingshot/">remember Slingshot?</a>) if they don't take off in their initial test markets.</p>
