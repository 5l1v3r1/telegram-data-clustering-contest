      <h1>Sequence of note | Masaan: Deepak mourns Shalu’s death</h1>
      <h2>In this week's Sequence of note, we revisit a heartbreaking moment from Vicky Kaushal starrer Masaan.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T06:46:09+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 06:46</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/anvita-singh/" target="_blank">Anvita Singh</a></address>
      <p>How do you mourn someone who you loved but for a brief period of time? How do you mourn a person who you dreamt of getting married to and spending the rest of your days with? What if that person suddenly dies in an accident, leaving you all alone? How do you deal with that kind of grief and insurmountable loss?</p>
      <p>Vicky Kaushal’s character in Masaan, Deepak, goes through that pain as his partner Shalu dies in an accident. He cannot concentrate on life, work and friends. Everything is a blur. The only thing that seems real to him is that he will not be able to talk to his lover and see her face ever again. That is the only frighteningly permanent aspect of life he has to deal with on his own.</p>
      <p>The three-minute sequence sees Deepak trying to drink his sorrows away as he is surrounded by a group of well-meaning friends. The pyre is burning and a train rushes past in the background. Deepak delivers a couplet, as he remembers his love for the deceased Shalu. And immediately after that, he breaks down, unable to hold the gates of grief any longer. He howls in pain and his close friends try to comfort him as he continues to sob mercilessly into the night.</p>
      <p>It is difficult to describe what Vicky does as an actor in the aforementioned scene. The words poignant, powerful and touching seem to mock the honesty of his portrayal, and so I will not use them. You will have to watch it to believe it.</p>

      <p>Screenwriter Varun Grover, in an interview with the Film Companion, had said, “He (Vicky) got so involved in the scene and interpreted on his own. Deepak was not meant to cry in this scene, but Vicky cried so much that he made everyone cry on the set. Vicky basically took that scene on that paper as an airstrip and he just flew. It’s one of my favourite scenes from the film.”</p>
