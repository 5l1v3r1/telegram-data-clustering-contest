      <p>Officially, the Japanese engine manufacturer - like others on the grid - are yet to sign up for the sweeping new regulations of 2021.</p>
      <p>But after a difficult return to the sport with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/formula-1/mclaren/"><b>McLaren</b></a> in 2015, Honda is now making clear progress, closing the gap to the other engines and winning three of the 20 grands prix so far in 2019.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/toyoharu-tanabe/"><b>Toyoharu Tanabe</b></a>, Honda's F1 technical boss, told the Dutch publication Formule 1 that he hopes the one-two in Brazil "has a positive impact" as the carmaker makes its decision about the future.</p>
      <p>"I hope this result has a positive impact on our future," the Japanese said.</p>
      <p>De Limburger, a Dutch newspaper, said Red Bull's Dr <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/helmut-marko/"><b>Helmut Marko</b></a> travelled directly from Brazil to Japan after the weekend's Interlagos race.</p>
      <p>"Sources in the paddock know that a deal to deliver engines in 2021 is in the works," the report said.</p>
      <p>"In Abu Dhabi, where the last race of the season will be held in two weeks, the Japanese would like to have news."</p>
      <p>Honda's Tanabe commented: "I am not involved in this process, but our board is working on it."</p>
