      <p>The actress and presenter, who is one of Matalan's brand ambassadors, visited the shop in Walsall to present customer Christine Wilkes with a new Fiat 500.</p>
      <p>Christine, from Walsall, was automatically entered into the prize draw after using her Matalan Reward Card in store.</p>
      <p>She said: "I couldn't believe it when Matalan contacted me to tell me I had won a brand new car.</p>
      <p>"I am a regular Matalan customer and always swipe my Reward Card, but I never in a million years thought that I would be the star prize winner.</p>
      <p>"It has been brilliant meeting Denise and the Matalan team, the icing on the cake."</p>
      <p>Denise said: "It has been so much fun meeting Christine and her family today, as well as the amazing staff and customers at Matalan's Walsall store.</p>
      <p>"What an incredible prize, I hope Christine enjoys her lovely new car."</p>
      <p>Jan Chapman, Matalan Walsall North store manager, added: "We are so excited that the star prize Reward Card winner is a Walsall North shopper. Not only that, but this is the biggest prize that Matalan has had up for grabs so far, so this is truly extra special.</p>
      <p>"We had another Reward Card winner at the store a few years ago, so I definitely think this is a lucky store.</p>
      <p>"I hope Christine enjoys her prize and I look forward to seeing her and her family in store again soon.”</p>
      <p>Matalan customers are automatically entered into the prize draw as soon as they shop at Matalan and use their Reward Card. Prizes are on offer each month, from a £5 gift card to a star prize worth between £500 to £10,000.</p>
      <p>The Fiat 500 is the biggest prize to be won so far as part of the Matalan Reward Card programme.</p>
