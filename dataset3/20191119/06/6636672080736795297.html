      <p>Samsung increased Q3 bit shipments by 30% and quarterly revenue by 5% QoQ but its profit margin fell to 33% from 41% in Q2.</p>
      <p>Hynix grew bit shipments by 20% and revenue by 3.5% but saw profit margin fall to 24% from 28% in Q2 which would have been worse had it not been for a production shift from server DRAM to mobile DRAM.</p>
      <p>Micron increased bit shipments by almost 30% but saw its market share slip to under 20%.</p>
