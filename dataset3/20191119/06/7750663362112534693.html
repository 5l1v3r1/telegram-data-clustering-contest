      <h1>Alonso could still win F1 title - Verstappen</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/fernando-alonso/"><b>Fernando Alonso</b></a> would return to Formula 1 as a clear top-three driver.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T06:50:42+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 06:50</time> by <a rel="author">GMM F1</a></address>
      <p>That is the view of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/max-verstappen/"><b>Max Verstappen</b></a>, who was recently complimented by former F1 driver Alonso for his constant "attack mode" at the wheel of his <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/formula-1/red-bull/"><b>Red Bull</b></a>.</p>
      <p>Now, Verstappen is returning the compliment by predicting that a 2021 return to F1 for the 38-year-old Spaniard would be a success.</p>
      <p>"For me, Fernando is one of the best drivers," the Dutchman told the Spanish edition of Auto Bild.</p>
      <p>"It is a pity that I never really raced against him, because he did not have a very competitive car at the time.</p>
      <p>"But I think if Alonso was here with a top car, he would be among the top three to win the world championship," Verstappen added.</p>
