      <h1>Look at more than the monthly premium when choosing a health care policy</h1>

      <p>When it comes to choosing a health insurance plan, it's easy to focus solely on the premium. That’s an important consideration, but not the only one.</p>
      <p>“You need to sign up for a plan that you know you can afford otherwise, you might lose coverage, but you also have to look at the other details of the plan, like the deductible, copayments and coinsurance,” said Cynthia Cox, vice president of the <a href="https://www.kff.org/">Kaiser Family Foundation</a>.</p>
      <p>To keep those monthly premiums low, many policies have high deductibles. In some cases, they can be thousands of dollars for an individual.</p>
      <p>"Looking at a high-deductible plan, you just need to consider: Do I you have enough money in my savings to pay off this deductible, if I have an urgent health care need that I need to get care right away,” Cox said.</p>
      <p>You also need to compare coinsurance vs copay and know the difference between the two.</p>
      <p>"Copays are set dollar amounts, like $20 or $50. Coinsurance is a percentage of the overall bill,” Cox explained.</p>
      <p>With coinsurance, you’ll have to pay a percentage of a doctor’s bill or hospitalization cost, no matter how much it is.</p>
      <p>“Copays are much more predictable than coinsurance,” she said.</p>
