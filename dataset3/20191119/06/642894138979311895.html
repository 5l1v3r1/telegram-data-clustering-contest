      <p>Titus, the expert in <a href="https://www.titus.com/data-classification">data classification</a> and a Blackstone portfolio company, today unveiled its top 10 data security predictions for 2020. </p>
      <p>These timely insights are based on surveys and conversations with both public and private enterprises around the world, as well as executive participation at major events, including ISF 30th Annual World Congress, Cyber Security Connect UK, InfoSecurity Europe, Transglobal Secure Collaboration and Les Assises de la Securite.</p>
      <p>“Titus customers around the world are ideal sounding boards for the biggest trends and threats that can impact their long-term data security vision,” said Mark Cassetta, SVP Strategy at Titus. “Our ability to coalesce different points of view across military, government, financial, retail and healthcare organisations is invaluable to solving the toughest security problems today while anticipating and alleviating emerging pain points.” </p>
      <p>Titus has developed the following top 10 predictions for 2020 through this customer lens:</p>
      <h3>1. The value of business data will continue to rise</h3>
      <p>“Data is more valuable than oil,” said Andrew Yang, US presidential candidate, during the 15 October Democratic Presidential Debate. Vital data insights actually are more valuable than oil, which is why astute data security pros increasingly are assessing the value of business data that needs protecting first.</p>
      <h3>2. Companies will ramp up personal data identification</h3>
      <p>Most CISOs simply don’t know all the places where personal data exists within their organisations. Still, you can’t protect what you can’t find, so some companies will grapple with their personal data problems, while others will make headway with policies that protect personal data as it’s created and moves throughout the organisation, including where it’s stored and archived.</p>
      <h3>3. Organisations will realise that e-mail is the greatest threat to privacy</h3>
      <p>According to TechJury, office workers typically send about 40 work-related e-mails and receive about 90 e-mails daily. Extrapolate that number across a 1 000-person company and imagine the impact of 40 000 to 90 000 e-mails with potential personal data moving in/out of an organisation every day. Reviewing e-mails for sensitive personal data as they’re being created is the only effective way to reduce the risk of personal data that can be mishandled in the course of sending/receiving e-mails.</p>
      <h3>4. Stricter regulation enforcement will lead to bigger fines and jail time</h3>
      <p>Many data protection acts across Africa are fast approaching and companies that don’t comply could face consequences well beyond the “slap on the wrist” favoured by GDPR regulators. The expectation is that harsher fines and possible jail time will be doled out for non-compliance.</p>
      <h3>5. Cloud migrations will pick up speed</h3>
      <p>Cloud migrations will continue to pick up speed in the year ahead and so will the steady migration of lingering data security problems. Even after the move, security issues persist as most companies maintain both on-premises and cloud environments. The inability to support hybrid clouds is the biggest shortcoming in <a href="https://www.titus.com/platform-play-or-best-breed-choosing-data-classification-solution-thats-right-your-enterprise">many large platform offerings</a>.</p>
      <h3>6. CDOs and CISOs will find common ground</h3>
      <p>As data security, personal data privacy and compliance demands escalate, so will the opportunities for chief data officers (CDOs) to partner with chief information security officers (CISOs). Companies should encourage these two stakeholders to find common ground, align on priorities and build value-based recommendations to ensure that budget-focused CFOs actually green-light important projects.</p>
      <h3>7. Zero Trust, the ‘North Star’ of security architecture, will come into focus</h3>
      <p>Over the past year, <a href="https://www.titus.com/lets-talk-about-zero-trust">the concept of “Zero Trust”</a> has moved from cyber security buzzword into a concept that could serve as a unifying force in the industry. Aside from lingering definition debates, Zero Trust is evolving into a “North Star” framework for connecting different data security solutions as part of an overarching, best practices approach.</p>
      <h3>8. Machine learning will become more effective</h3>
      <p>Stricter opt-in and limited data-sharing agreements could diminish the effectiveness of artificial intelligence and <a href="https://www.titus.com/machinelearning">machine learning</a> solutions. But, it’s important to remember that automation can significantly ease the identification and protection of sensitive data. Even military and government agencies appreciate the value of machine learning in helping build better data security frameworks. In 2020, the focus should be on helping organisations normalise their machine learning usage as it relates to data management and data protection.</p>
      <h3>9. A new set of data superheroes will emerge</h3>
      <p>A new breed of data scientist can elevate a company’s security strategies by analysing the complete life cycle of data with a critical eye to security implications. As this viewpoint doesn’t exist typically today, expect to see this role rise through the ranks to take on increasingly important profiles in defining and deploying security policies.</p>
      <h3>10. Data management and data protection will converge</h3>
      <p>The rise of the data security scientist mirrors a broader convergence taking place among data management and data protection stakeholders. Traditionally separate organisations, there’s growing consensus that stronger alliances between data management and data protection teams will lead to better decision-making. In addition to establishing best practices for data stewardship across the entire data life cycle, there are ample opportunities for skills cross-pollination and strategic collaboration.</p>
