      <p>REUTERS: Louisiana state government computers were knocked out following a ransomware attack, the governor said on Monday, as results from the close gubernatorial election in the southern state await certification.</p>
      <p>Many state agencies had their servers taken down in response to the attack, Governor John Bel Edwards said in a series of messages posted to Twitter. He said the agencies were coming back online but that full restoration could take "several days."</p>

      <p>"There is no anticipated data loss and the state did not pay a ransom," he said. Ransomware works by scrambling data held on vulnerable computers and demanding a payment to unlock it.</p>
      <p>Louisiana Secretary of State spokesman Tyler Brey said that while his office's website was briefly offline, the tallying of Saturday's vote, in which Bel Edwards narrowly won re-election, was unaffected.</p>
      <p>The vote drew national attention following U.S. President Donald Trump's well-publicized endorsement of Bel Edward's Republican challenger, Eddie Rispone.</p>
      <p>Louisiana's candidates have until next week to contest the results and ask for a recount.</p>
      <p>A person familiar with the matter identified the particular breed of ransomware that struck Louisiana as Ryuk, a variant which cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike said has earned its operators US$3.7 million since its appearance last year. Experts believe that Ryuk is used by financially motivated criminals rather than foreign governments.</p>
      <p>Louisiana is one of a long list of local jurisdictions that have been bedeviled by ransomware attacks. The state made headlines in July after it declared a state of emergency following an outbreak that disrupted several school districts.</p>
      <p>The state has also drawn criticism for its failure to implement a paper audit of its voting machines.</p>
      <p>Messages seeking comment from Louisiana's Division of Administration and the Louisiana branches of the Democratic and Republican parties were not immediately returned.</p>
