      <p>TAIPEI (Taiwan News) – The military launched a new series of exercises Tuesday (November 19), just two days after China sent its first domestically built aircraft carrier through the Taiwan Strait.</p>
      <p>The <anchor name="https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3819043"/><a href="https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/3819043">north-to-south passage </a>of the Type 002 carrier was widely seen as another attempt by the communist regime to influence the January 11, 2020 presidential and legislative elections on the island.</p>
      <p>The drills, named “Lien Hsiang” (聯翔), were directed against an air attack and would involve F-16 fighter jets from a base in Hualien County pretending to be enemy aircraft, the Ministry of National Defense said.</p>
      <p>Army, Navy, Air Force and missile units would cooperate in testing their joined response to the simulated attack, according to a report by the Central News Agency.</p>
      <p>Chief of the General Staff Shen Yi-ming (沈一鳴), who hails from the Air Force, represented President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) at the special command center to oversee the developments in Tuesday’s military drills, according to the CNA.</p>
