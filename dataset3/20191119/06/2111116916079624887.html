        <i> Honor India reached out to us mentioning that these press images are incorrect, and are likely to be different from the final product. We will update this story once we have more information.</i>

      <p>Honor has a big event <a href="https://www.techradar.com/in/news/honor-v30-pro-with-5g-set-to-be-unveiled-on-november-26-in-china">scheduled for next week</a>, where its next flagship, the V30, will be unveiled. Some press renders of the phone have surfaced, which confirm a few design elements as well as a triple camera setup on the back.</p>
      <p>The<a href="https://www.techradar.com/in/news/honor-v30-pro-with-5g-set-to-be-unveiled-on-november-26-in-china"> Honor V30</a> will launch in China on November 26, alongside a few other products. The teasers confirmed that it would sport a punch-hole display with two selfie cameras, but the back was still a mystery. It seems like we can stop the guesswork, as <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/honor-v30-press-render-design-punch-hole-dual-selfie-camera-exclusive/">91mobiles </a>was able to source the official press images of the device before the launch. </p>

      <p>These renders also show a pill-shaped notch for the front cameras, in line with the previous teasers. The back sports a big rectangular-shaped island for what seems like a triple camera setup and a lot of wasted space. Some rumors suggested that it will sport a 60MP primary camera, flanked by an ultra-wide and a telephoto shooter.</p>
      <p>We can also see a side-mounted fingerprint scanner, which will double as the power/lock button. There’s no headphone jack in sight.</p>
      <p>On the inside, the Honor V30 will be powered by the new 7nm <a href="https://www.techradar.com/in/news/kirin-990-chipset-announced-at-ifa-2019-and-itll-probably-power-the-huawei-mate-30">Kirin 990 chipset</a> and will have native 5G capabilities. A non-5G variant could also tag along. A 4,000 mAh battery with support for  SuperCharge will round things up.</p>

      <p>The display will be an LCD panel with a Full HD+ resolution and a tall aspect ratio. It will run on EMUI 10 based on Android 10, but Google Play Services are unlikely to be available out-of-the-box.</p>
      <p>An Honor V30 Pro was also rumored, which will add another camera to the back, ship with a slightly bigger battery that can SuperCharge at 40W, and will come with an OLED display instead of an LCD.</p>
      <p>The same November 26 event will <a href="https://twitter.com/RODENT950/status/1196366985283719170">also see</a> the debut of the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/in/news/honor-watch-magic-2-launch-date-confirmed-and-weve-got-the-first-images">Honor Magic Watch 2</a>, Magic Book 14 laptop, a 40W wireless SuperCharger, and a few other lifestyle products.</p>
