      <p>They have taken place across the country. From Georgia to California. At elementary, middle and high schools. On college and university campuses.</p>
      <p>In 46 weeks this year, there have been 45 school shootings. That's nearly an average of one school shooting a week.</p>
      <p>Of those, 32 of them were at facilities serving Kindergarten through 12th grade.</p>
      <p>Since there is no single definition for what qualifies as a school shooting, CNN set the following parameters:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The shooting must involve at least one person being shot (not including the shooter).</li>
        <li>The shooting must occur on school property, which includes but is not limited to buildings, athletic fields, parking lots, stadiums and buses.</li>
        <li>We included accidental discharge of a firearm as long as the first two parameters are met, except in instances where the sole shooter is law enforcement or a security officer.</li>
        <li>We included injuries sustained from BB guns, since the Consumer Product Safety Commission has identified them as potentially lethal.</li>
      </ul>
