      </p>
      <p>The proposed National Executive Council meeting of the All Progressives Congress earlier slated for Friday is still uncertain as President Muhammadu Buhari’s has yet to give his consent.</p>
      <p>But the national caucus meeting will still hold on Thursday as proposed, our correspondent gathered on Monday night.</p>
      <p>According to Article 12.5 of the APC constitution, members of the national caucus include 10 members of the National Working Committee, past and present presidents and vice-presidents, current presidential and vice-presidential candidates of the party as well as the Secretary to the Government of the Federation.</p>
      <p>Others are the past and present Senate presidents and their deputies, and past and present speakers of the House of Representatives and their deputies, among others.</p>
      <p>A member of the NWC, who spoke in confidence with our correspondent after their meeting in Abuja on Monday, said the committee reviewed the governorship elections in Kogi and Bayelsa states and commended the leadership of the party.</p>
      <p>“We reviewed the progress made so far in our electoral fortunes and gave ourselves a pass mark but not without noting some areas that we need to improve in future elections. We did our best and the result is there for everyone to see.”</p>
      <p>Asked if the NWC set agenda for the NEC meeting, he said that would only come up at the national caucus meeting where such issues would be addressed.</p>
      <p>Another source, however, told our correspondent that the NWC would at the caucus meeting present financial books of the party to stakeholders for review before presentation at the NEC meeting.</p>
      <p>“We are also going to set agenda for the NEC meeting at the national caucus meeting. That will serve as the preparatory ground,” the source added.</p>
      <p>The APC National Publicity Secretary, Lanre Issa-Onilu, refused to comment on the outcome of the NWC meeting on Monday.</p>
      <p>“Yes, we met but the issues are not for public consumption,” he simply said.</p>
      <p>He, however, confirmed that the national caucus meeting would hold on Thursday while the NEC meeting “is tentative” without giving reasons.</p>
      <p>But a source within the top hierarchy said the NEC meeting was still in doubt because the President’s consent had not been sought.</p>
      <p>“The President just returned from abroad; so the leadership of the party needs to meet him and know his schedules to know the time that will be most convenient for him. It is an important meeting that the president and vice-president have to be in attendance since it is the first in a while,” the source added.</p>
