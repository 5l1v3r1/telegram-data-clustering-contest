      <p>REUTERS: Louisiana state government computers were hit by ransomware, two people familiar with the matter said on Monday, as results from the closely-fought election for governor in the southern state are still awaiting certification.</p>
      <p>The extent of the outbreak is not yet clear, although Louisiana Secretary of State spokesman Tyler Brey said the tallying of Saturday's vote, which happens on a different system, was not affected.</p>

      <p>The Secretary of State's website was briefly down earlier on Monday, "as were all state websites that ended in LA.gov," Brey said.</p>
      <p>The vote, which saw Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards win re-election, drew national attention following U.S. President Donald Trump's well-publicized endorsement of the Republican challenger, Eddie Rispone.</p>
      <p>Louisiana's candidates have until next week to contest the results and ask for a recount.</p>
      <p>Ransomware works by scrambling data held on vulnerable computers and demanding a payment to unlock it.</p>
      <p>A person familiar with the matter identified the particular breed of ransomware that struck Louisiana as Ryuk, a variant which cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike said has earned its operators US$3.7 million since its appearance last year. Experts believe that Ryuk is used by financially motivated criminals rather than foreign governments.</p>
      <p>Messages seeking comment from Louisiana's Division of Administration and the Louisiana branches of the Democratic and Republican parties were not immediately returned.</p>
