      <p>The lights around the town were the centrepiece of the annual festival of lights, held in and around Cheshire Street on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The official switch-on followed a day full of entertainment which included choir singing, fire eating and a visit from Santa Claus.</p>
      <p>Outside the library and under the buttercross, groups including the Grove School's choir Voicebox and the Harmonettes treated shoppers to festive tunes.</p>
      <p>There were also vintage vehicles on display in the town centre.</p>
      <p>It culminated in the big switch-on at 5pm by mayor Roger Smith and a team from the event sponsors, the Leek United Building Society.</p>
      <h3>'The best yet'</h3>
      <p>Town councillor Mike Smith said: "It was very, very busy, the best yet to be fair. Loads more stalls, the music side was good, the old transport items added interest. Overall a really good day."</p>
      <p>Town clerk Julie Jones agreed that the event was one of their busiest ever, if not the busiest.</p>
      <p>"It went really well, it was very, very busy," she said.</p>
      <p>"Lots of entertainment, it all went down well.</p>
      <p>"The singers were all very good, the switch-on was very busy.</p>
      <p>"We got lucky with the weather, just about. It was a reasonable day.</p>
      <p>"The feedback we've had was very positive."</p>
      <p>She said that through the rest of the year the Christmas lights in the town will come on at about 2pm every day.</p>
