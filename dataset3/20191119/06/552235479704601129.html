      <h1>Graeme Murty's Rangers manager stint broke him but he's back to his best with Colts - Gavin Berry</h1>
      <h2>Gavin reckons he looked a bit out of his depth when in caretaker charge but his work with the reserves and youths shouldn't go unnoticed.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T06:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Gavin Berry, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/gavin-berry/</a></address>
      <p>Graeme Murty joked he had to wipe the custard from his face after <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/daniel-candeias">Daniel Candeias</a> snubbed him during a goal celebration.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese winger netted the winner against Hearts at Ibrox in April 2018.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/graeme-murty">Murty</a> said Candeias “ran straight past me” as he made a beeline for sub Andy Halliday who had suffered Hampden humiliation the previous week when he was hooked before half-time in a 4-0 Scottish Cup semi-final loss to Celtic.</p>
      <p>That game was the last time Murty was in the Ibrox dugout before his Rangers Colts side’s 2-0 win over Wrexham in the Challenge Cup on Saturday.</p>
      <p>It was an eventul 19-month period with the Candeias snub nothing compared to the humiliation he suffered the following week after a 5-0 mauling at the hands of Celtic at Parkhead.</p>
      <p>That proved to be his last match in caretaker charge of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rangers-fc">Rangers</a> with Jimmy Nicholl stepping up for the final three games before Steven Gerrard’s arrival.</p>

      <p>It was a tough learning curve for the former Scotland full-back who answered the club’s call after Pedro Caixinha’s sacking – the second time he’d stepped up after an interim spell following Mark Warburton’s axing.</p>
      <p>That led to chairman Dave King calling Murty his “man of the year” at the club’s agm.</p>
      <p>Lee Wallace and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/kenny-miller">Kenny Miller</a> might beg to differ after their alleged bust-up with Murty in the aftermath of that Scottish Cup semi-final loss. It remains a mystery what took place inside the dressing room that day with conflicting rumours of just how heated it got.</p>
      <p>Ironically, Murty’s victorious return could see him on a collision course with Miller after the veteran striker scored for Partick Thistle in their 4-1 Challenge Cup win at Stenhousemuir to secure a semi-final spot.</p>
      <p>But Murty’s success in guiding his young Light Blues into the semis is just a reminder of his own career rehabilitation since that traumatic end to his time in the hot-seat.</p>
      <p>Many believed a clean break from the club would have been the easiest solution – it couldn’t have been easy walking the corridors of the Rangers Training Centre when Wallace and Miller were still around – for all.</p>
      <p>But to his credit the 45-year-old returned to the Academy where he was first appointed three years ago after forging an impressive reputation with Norwich’s youths.</p>
      <p>Under Academy chief Craig Mulholland and alongside Brian Gilmour, Peter Lovenkrands, David McCallum and Kevin Thomson he is helping to create a sense of excite-ment for the future – the job he was brought in to do in the first place.</p>
