      <p>Former England striker John Fashanu believes that Joe Aribo will become a “key player” for the Super Eagles according to an interview in The Sun of Scotland.</p>
      <p>Fashanu spoke during the international break during which Nigeria defeated Benin Republic and Lesotho that saw Aribo impressing again before he substituted late in the game.</p>
      <p>When asked about the long-term prospects for Aribo, Fashanu said: “Aribo is going to be a very important player for Nigeria. He is going to be one of our key players for years. He’s been doing very well for Rangers and has been exceptional since his debut for Nigeria”.</p>
      <p>“Joe is going to be targeted by the opposition because they know what he can do. It’s important he is used properly by us because he’s vital for the team”.</p>
      <p>“Nigeria have very strong and skillful players. Joe Aribo is one of them. He has been doing well at his club and everyone knows he is a very dangerous player. He’s one we have to watch”.</p>
      <p>Aribo has made an immediate impact at Ibrox since arriving from Charlton on a development fee after his contract ran out, scoring 5 goals and 3 assists in 23 appearances.</p>
      <p>Not only has he scored important Europa League goals but he has made his debut for Nigeria including a well-taken goal against Brazil, despite former manager Lee Bowyer saying he had made “the wrong move”, he appears to be doing alright for himself.</p>
      <p>Fashanu has been impressed with Aribo since he made his Nigeria debut and just a few games in has predicted a big future for him. The young midfielder is adept in a few roles and is capable of winning the ball back and playing a part in building attacks.</p>
