      <p>Since missing your periods remains one of the major tell-tale signs of pregnancy, it gets a little tricky for those battling irregular menstruation cycle. There are a lot of women who do not realise that they are <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/relationships/love-sex/best-sex-positions-to-get-pregnant/articleshow/5317909.cms">pregnant</a> right away as they miss out on the subtle signs of pregnancy. Yes, even before you miss your periods and feel the need to take a <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/relationships/love-sex/5-Best-positions-to-get-pregnant-fast/articleshow/5317909.cms">pregnancy</a> test, there are certain sneaky ways your body tells you that there is little life growing inside you. Take a look.</p>
      <p>
        <b>1.You are rushing to the washroom frequently</b>
      </p>
      <p>Feeling the need to pee frequently is one of the earliest signs of pregnancy. If you have beginning to feel that you are spending a considerably large amount of time in your washroom, maybe it is time to pee on the stick. You can thank the host of hormonal changes and a growing uterus for the increased production of urine.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2. Everything smells off</b>
      </p>
      <p>Are you suddenly revolted with the way boiled eggs smell in the morning and cannot stand the fragrance of your favourite pumpkin latte? When you are pregnant, it is common to have a love-hate relationship with the food items you could not have enough of before. You may even find certain fragrances increasingly revolting. You can blame the increased levels of hCG and progesterone for your heightened sense of smell.</p>
      <p>
        <b>3. Your dreams are weird</b>
      </p>
      <p>While everyone has bizarre dreams once in a blue moon, pregnancy can bring a host of really weird visions on a regular basis. So, in case you have been experiencing extremely vivid and unusual dreams while gearing up for the arrival of the newborn, do not get spooked out. For an expectant mother, it is common to get weird and strange dreams.</p>
      <p>
        <b>4. Your boobs weigh A LOT</b>
      </p>
      <p>You feel that your twins have started to ache a lot and have grown bigger. While PMS is known to cause swollen, tender breasts, pregnancy can mimic the same behaviour. Since your body gears up your mammary glands to provide enough food for the little one, breast enlargement is common.</p>
      <p>
        <b>5. You are EXHAUSTED</b>
      </p>
      <p>You feel tired, drained out and sleepy--everything you may experience on your periods. However, the periods have gone missing and youâ€™re exhausted due to no apparent reason. The simplest explanation here is that your body is working overtime to prepare your body for giving birth.</p>
