      <p>Mistura Durosinlorun emerged the best players at the 3rd Ex-pro Diaspora Squash tournament winning the Under 13 and Under 16 categories in the female cadre at Teslim Balogun, Lagos at the weekend.</p>
      <p>She defeated Jennifer Madukozo, 3-1 (U13) and Favour Utukpe, 3-2 (U16) to emerge champion.</p>
      <p>Durosinlorun won a trophy and medals for her efforts. The 12 years old who has won the under 13 category for three consecutive years said she wasn’t scared of her opponents and knew their weak point which gave her the edge.</p>
      <p>An exited Durosinlorun said: “I am happy to win in two categories. It has never happened before. I wasn’t really scared because I have played my opponents many times. I thank the organisers for the opportunity.”</p>
      <p>In the U13 boys, Dominion Utukpe beat Daniel Nzei in straight set 11-6, 11-3, 11-8. Wisdom Nzei from Akwa Ibom defeated Joseph Enaifoghe 11-8, 8-11, 11-8, 7-11, 12-10 to emerge champion in the Under 16 boys’ category.</p>
      <p>President Nigeria Squash Federation (NSF), Boye Oyerinde told NationSport that he is impressed with the players’ development and the outcome of tournaments organised by the NSF in recent time. He also said the grassroots programmes have helped nurture young talents in the country.</p>
      <p>Boye also said that the young talents need consistency to improve in their game.</p>
