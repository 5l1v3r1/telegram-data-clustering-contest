      <h1>Adama Traore a joy to have at Wolves, says Conor Coady</h1>
      <h2>Skipper Conor Coady insists it is a pleasure to have the ‘brilliant’ Adama Traore at Wolves.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T06:06:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 06:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/joe-edwards/" target="_blank">Joe Edwards</a></address>
      <p>Traore has caught the eye so far this campaign with his ferocious speed and improved end-product.</p>
      <p>His form even saw him receive his first Spain call-up – after interest from Mali – before he had to pull out through injury.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old was instrumental in the 2-1 victory over old club Villa before the international break, but Coady said: “It is not just the big games he is doing it in. He is improving in every single game.</p>
      <p>“He is a brilliant professional, he works so hard.</p>
      <p>“It is a pleasure to have him at the club.”</p>
      <p>Traore struggled to make an impact last season for Wolves after being snapped up from Middlesbrough for £18million.</p>
      <p>But, this season, he has chipped in with two goals – a double in the 2-0 masterclass at reigning Premier League champions Manchester City – and five assists across all competitions.</p>
      <p>Traore was then reported to have agreed to represent Mali internationally, but he told the Express &amp; Star that was not the case.</p>
      <p>Spain later called him up in place of the injured Valencia striker Rodrigo.</p>
      <p>However, a hamstring injury picked up against Villa meant he had to pull out.</p>
      <p>Traore, though, is expected to be fit for Saturday’s trip to Bournemouth as Wolves return to league action – looking to extend their unbeaten run in the top flight to eight games.</p>
      <p>“He can run and run. He is improving game on game and he is a brilliant person,” added Coady.</p>
      <p>“He trains so hard every single day to get better and better.</p>
      <p>“He attracts people to him to help him get better.</p>
      <p>“I think when you have players like that in your team you are always a threat on the counter-attack.”</p>
