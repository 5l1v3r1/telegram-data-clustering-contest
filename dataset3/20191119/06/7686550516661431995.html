      <p>The woman who has accused <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/prince-andrew-duke-of-york">Prince Andrew</a> of sleeping with her when she was just 17 has given an interview to BBC’s Panorama.</p>
      <p>Virginia Giuffre, now 35, is said to reiterate her claims he slept with her when she was just 17 after allegedly being trafficked from the US by the royal’s billionaire paedophile pal Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>But she is believed to be furious that her interview, filmed three weeks before Andrew’s denials about having sex with Virginia on BBC ­Newsnight with Emily Maitlis last week, has not been aired</p>
      <p>It comes as accountancy giant KPMG announced it has dropped sponsorship for one of the prince’s schemes.</p>
      <p>And the calls for him to speak to FBI agents investigating Epstein grew.</p>
      <p>A source close to Virginia said: “She has made no bones about her thoughts on the duke’s denial, and did not to ­Panorama. She has asked him to ‘come clean’, but she feels if anything he’s put more dirt in the water.”</p>
      <p>There is speculation in the US that Virginia’s chat with the BBC was held back so as not to jeopardise 59-year-old Andrew’s appearance on Newsnight.</p>
      <p>The source added: “Her legal team are at a loss as to why the interviews have not been broadcast.</p>
      <p>“All other broadcasters have aired their interviews almost immediately but not the BBC. Several people working on Virginia’s case question why it has been held back and wonder if it was not to jeopardise the ­interview with the duke. During her interview, she was asked why she thought Andrew had remained silent. Of course that now is no longer the case.”</p>

      <p>Sources close to the BBC said the Panorama interview has not yet been aired as it forms “part of a larger ­investigation” – words that will send the Palace into panic.</p>
      <p>The BBC travelled to America to ­interview Virginia. Producers are ­undecided as to whether to see her again after Andrew’s denials. A spokesman said: “We never comment on an ongoing investigation.”</p>
      <p>A lawyer for three of Epstein’s victims called on the duke to testify to the FBI under oath, after he denied any ­knowledge of the ­financier’s perverted behaviour. Gloria Allred said: “I would like Prince Andrew to really feel what these victims was suffered, because he seemed to hardly mention the victims and how they were harmed. I don’t see how he could have not known Mr Epstein was around underage minors because he visited several of his homes where they were.</p>
      <p>“Why didn’t he ask the right questions. ‘Why are you here?’ ‘Why aren’t you in school?’. I guess if he didn’t want to see them, he could have not seen them but I don’t know how he couldn’t know when there were so many of them there.</p>
      <p>“Now he’s been in the court of public opinion, he should testify to the FBI.”</p>
      <p>Fellow US lawyer Spencer Kulvin, who also represents an Epstein victim, added: “I was shocked he would go on camera like this because anything he says can be utilised in a cross-examination of him, should he come forward allow himself to be interviewed by the US authorities, which I believe he should do.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think there’s any way that a man who’s been to all three of Mr Epstein’s homes could avoid seeing what was going on in them, with people going in and out and young girls being shuttled in and out of those homes.”</p>
      <p>And a victim of the paedophile called on anyone who had information on his vile sex trafficking or abuse to come forward and help the FBI.</p>

      <p>Calling herself Jane Doe 15, she said: “It is upsetting to me to think that anyone who was closely associate with Jeffrey Epstein might argue that they didn’t suspect that he might have been ­sexually abusing children.</p>
      <p>“Any others who are close to Epstein should come forward and give a ­statement under oath on what ­information they have.”</p>
      <p>KPMG revealed yesterday the firm would no longer sponsor Andrew’s Pitch@Palace mentoring initiative.</p>
      <p>Others, including Anglo-Swedish drugmaker AstraZenec and youth programme The Outward Bound Trust are holding meetings to discuss their affiliation with the duke. And students at the University of Huddersfield were last night due to vote on a motion to lobby the prince to resign as its chancellor, a post he has held since 2015.</p>
      <p>The outcome is due to be published in the next few days. Stephen Dorril, a former lecturer, said: “Students are very concerned about things like sexual harassment and to be associated with someone who at the least was a friend of a convicted sex trafficker, is not a good thing for the university.”</p>
      <p>A Sky News poll last night found only 6% believed the explanations Andrew gave Newsnight, with 51% saying he was being untruthful and 43% unsure.</p>
      <p>Sabah Kaiser, an ambassador to the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse, said of his performance: “I found the Prince’s demeanour, his rhetoric, it was diminishing.</p>
      <p>“There was no mention of the victims. He had nothing to offer them. I found it upsetting.”</p>

      <p>Sabah, who was abused as a child, added: “When you have someone in his position excusing, explaining away, it makes you feel you are insignificant, that you are never going to be believed.</p>
      <p>“You are never going to be listened to and if you do come forward you are going to be dismissed.”</p>
      <p>Andrew has denied any wrongdoing and insists he has never met Virginia, despite a picture showing him with his arm around her at the London flat of British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell.</p>
      <p>The prince has suggested the photo was doctored. He met Epstein in 1999 but kept on seeing him after the tycoon was jailed in 2008 for procuring a minor for sex, even staying at his home.</p>
      <p>Epstein died earlier this year in a US prison while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.</p>
