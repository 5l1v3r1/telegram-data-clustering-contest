      <p>The Coordinator of the One District One (1D1F)Factory Secretariat, Gifty Ohene Konadu has assured that, each district in the country would have at least, one functioning factory, with some chalking a whopping seven (7) before the 2020 elections, <a href="http://MyNewsGh.com/">MyNewsGh.com</a> reports.</p>
      <p>She says some districts may even have more than the stipulated number of at least one; citing Nkawkaw alone to be having up to seven factories.</p>
      <p>“There are seven factories under construction at Nkawkaw; this is seven in one; so the establishment of the factories are ongoing and I dare say we will deliver all of them before election 2020; but the only thing is that, some have started, some are at a certain stage of completion while others are already running; that’s how it’s going to be. We will build of all them; fear not, for I’m the one telling you”, she told Afia Pokuah in an interview on Okay FM monitored by <a href="http://MyNewsGh.com/">MyNewsGh.com</a> on Monday.</p>
      <p>“You will be surprised; in Asante Akim South, my constituency, we have two big projects currently ongoing; if you go to Nsawam-Adoagyir they are abundance; when they are completed, we shall call the press and point them one by one for Ghanaians to see</p>
      <p>This follows the display and test sale of the first batch of pineapple juice from the Ekumfi Pineapple Factory under the 1D1F initiative.</p>
      <p>Pictures of the nicely packaged fruit juices in paper packs broke the internet on Saturday when the Minister of Food and Agriculture, Dr Owusu Afriyie Akoto posted them on Facebook.</p>
      <p>“Eku Juice” according to the manufacturers does not include concentrates but squeezed from natural juices of fresh pineapples grown by Ghanaian farmers.</p>
      <p>The $8 million project which officially commenced in March 2018 now has 400 workers including out-growers.</p>
      <p>It is the biggest pineapple juice processing factory in West Africa and the first to be completed under the government’s flagship One District One Factory initiative.</p>
      <p>At full capacity, it can process 10 tonnes of fruits per hour.</p>
