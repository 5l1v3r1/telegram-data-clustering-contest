      <p><b>Dear Ellie:</b> My boyfriend and I have lost our passion.</p>
      <p>Physically, I look the same as five years ago, though we both agree I want to get more fit.</p>
      <p>He always says I have bad breath. But my brutally honest friends don’t think my breath smells. Yet unless I’ve just brushed my teeth/used an oral strip, he insists it smells bad. I feel awful and helpless.</p>
      <p>I’ve said that if he loves me, has passion toward me, this shouldn’t be such a huge issue. What should I or we do?</p>
      <p>
        <b>Helpless</b>
      </p>
      <p>It may be tempting for many readers to just think, “Dump him.”</p>
      <p>But let’s first consider some basic facts about bad breath (halitosis):</p>
      <p>It can be caused by poor oral hygiene, strong-smelling foods and dental-health problems.</p>
      <p>Chronic bad breath usually results from bacteria on the tongue and mouth surfaces, releasing unpleasant odours.</p>
      <p>Short-term bad breath is associated with strong-smelling foods and drinks e.g. fish, onions, garlic and coffee.</p>
      <p>You and a caring boyfriend should’ve already researched these facts online, then checked further if needed.</p>
      <p>Poor dental care can cause bad odour, as can health problems like postnasal drip, chronic reflux (heartburn) and some more serious diseases.</p>
      <p>However, what else could be going on here?</p>
      <p>Why is he so critical of your physical shape and so persistent about your breath being bad when no one else agrees?</p>
      <p>Most important, why does he make you feel helpless?</p>
      <p>Here’s what you can do now: Get to a dental clinic, fast. If fine, see your doctor.</p>
      <p>If there’s no dental/medical/food-related cause, drop the bad-breath label by dumping him.</p>
      <p>You deserve better. Someone who makes you feel awful and helpless is no longer a good partner for you, passion or not.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><b>Dear Ellie: </b>My wife is smart, and has been a terrific mother for our kids from day one.</p>
      <p>The problem is, she’s always right. When we need to discuss something, she always begins with her final answer. It isn’t easy to get a real exchange of views.</p>
      <p>Also, these impasses often arise when the kids are around. I’ll raise a topic and she’ll make a pronouncement before I finish the sentence.</p>
      <p>I then tense up, and we’re all uncomfortable.</p>
      <p>There are times when her decision on what’s right is not right for us, as a couple or family.</p>
      <p>But she clings so hard to her first opinion, that even when she occasionally accepts my view, she never apologizes.</p>
      <p>I love her, but it’s tough being only a so-called partner.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Frustrated</b>
      </p>
      <p>Some would call it a power play, since she clearly feels she has to be right.</p>
      <p>But that can also mean that, for reasons you either don’t know or don’t get, she’s insecure.</p>
      <p>Living together, raising children, working at a job or at home, all require a constant stream of decisions.</p>
      <p>Sometimes, the early years of raising newborns and small children moves one parent to adapt quickly and choose what seems the best practices.</p>
      <p>The feeling of being the responsible one, can lead to inflexibility about the ways of doing things.</p>
      <p>Over time, it can create a sometimes-dominant personality.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, in your particular situation, you’ve stayed together and you admire your wife for her positive qualities.</p>
      <p>Tell her so, and raise the idea of couples’ counselling as a new look together at how you can both learn to improve your communication and make decisions that leave you both feeling satisfied (instead of stressing who’s “right” or not).</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>Ellie’s tip of the day</b>
      </p>
      <p>A loving partner helps you find out why your breath smells bad, rather than just shaming you.</p>
