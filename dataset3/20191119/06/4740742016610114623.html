      <h1>School bosses in Bristol area get paid more than £100k per year</h1>
      <h2>A government agency is challenging trusts which offer high salaries</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T06:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Andrew McQuarrie</a></address>
      <p>A schools trust has defended the payment of salaries of more than £100,000 to several executives.</p>
      <p>Wellsway Multi-Academy Trust (MAT) runs schools in Bristol and nearby areas, including <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/keynsham">Keynsham</a> and Oldland Common.</p>
      <p>The trust has twice received letters from a government agency expressing concern about the amount of money given to executives in 2017/18.</p>
      <p>But a trust spokesman has told Bristol Live they are “confident” their salary spend is not unusual, adding: “It has increased because our trust has grown, with more schools choosing to join our trust.”</p>
      <p>Local schools under the control of Wellsway MAT include Wansdyke Primary School in <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/whitchurch">Whitchurch</a> and Sir Bernard Lovell Academy in Oldland Common.</p>
      <p>In October, the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/education">Education</a> and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA) wrote to 14 academy trusts about high salaries, with 12 of those having been contacted already, including Wellsway MAT.</p>
      <p>In the letter to Wellsway MAT, ESFA chief executive Eileen Milner explained the trust was one of a “very small number” that had paid “multiple salaries” of between £100,000 and £150,000 in 2017/2018.</p>
      <p>She wrote: “I originally wrote to you about the issue of high pay …  I am writing to you now… to request further information on your process and the rationale for setting these levels of salaries within your academy trust.”</p>
      <p>Ms Milner added: “This forms part of our ongoing campaign to challenge academy trusts with high levels of executive pay.”</p>

      <p>A Wellsway MAT spokeswoman told Bristol Live that three employees were paid between £100,000 and £150,000 in 2017/2018, up from two employees in 2016/17, while the figures for 2018/19 have not yet been audited and published.</p>
      <p>The highest salary in 2017/18 went to the trust’s chief executive officer Andrea Arlidge.</p>
      <p>A Wellsway MAT spokesman said: "We welcome the scrutiny of multi academy trust (MAT) finances.</p>
      <p>“Our trust seeks at all times to minimise our overheads so that maximum funding goes directly to our schools.</p>
      <p>"The Board regularly benchmarks our spending against other trusts and is confident that our salary spend is in line with MATs of a similar size, nature and stage of growth.</p>
      <p>“It has increased because our trust has grown, with more schools choosing to join our trust."</p>
      <p>Other schools run by Wellsway MAT include <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bedminster">Bedminster</a> Down School (joined the trust after 2016/17), Saltford CofE Primary School and IKB Academy in Keynsham.</p>
