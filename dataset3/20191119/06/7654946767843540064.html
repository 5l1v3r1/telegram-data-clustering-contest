      <h1>Obama mail bomber busted thanks to cat hair gets 10 years behind bars</h1>

      <p>The Texas woman who sent former President Barack Obama an explosive package — only to be tracked down because of a <a href="https://nypost.com/2017/11/23/cat-hair-lead-officials-to-woman-who-allegedly-sent-explosives-to-obama/">cat hair on the parcel</a> — was sentenced to 10 years in prison on Monday, authorities said.</p>
      <p>Julia Poff, who pleaded guilty in July to transporting explosives with intent to kill, was sentenced to 120 months behind bars by District Judge Vanessa Gilmore for the caper, according to the FBI.</p>
      <p>Poff, who reportedly worked for a number of years at a fireworks stand, assembled the explosives and sent them to President Obama, Texas Governor Greg Abbott, and Security Administration Commissioner Carolyn Colvin​ in October 2016.</p>
      <p>The bomb sent to Abbott didn’t detonate because the governor didn’t open it “as designed,” according to court papers.</p>
      <p>​Security screeners intercepted the packages sent to Obama and Colvin.​</p>
      <p>Federal investigators were able to track the devices back to Poff after they found shipping labels, a salad dressing cap used in one of the bombs and cat hair that was traced to one of her cats.</p>
      <p>“All I can say is I’m sorry,” Poff said at her sentencing on Friday,<a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Brookshire-woman-who-mailed-explosives-to-Obama-14843999.php"> the Houston Chronicle reported</a>. “I’m sorry to the people I’ve hurt.”</p>
