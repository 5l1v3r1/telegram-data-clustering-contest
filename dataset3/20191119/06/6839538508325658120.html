      <p>Cottesloe’s upmarket Napoleon Street is closed after a truck hit and brought down low-hanging Christmas lights about 12.30pm today.</p>
      <p>“I warned Cottesloe Council a week ago that the street lights were going to get caught because a dump truck coming down nearly hit them and had to reverse into dangerous Stirling Highway in the rain,” Peppermint Grove Jewellers owner Giuseppe Algeri told communitynews.com.au.</p>
      <p>Several strings of lights now litter the road.</p>

      <p>The annual decorations are organised by the council.</p>
      <p>Allied Pickfords removal truck driver Robert, who would not give his surname, said there should have been a sign on the street for tall vehicles.</p>
      <p>“There’s supposed to be a height warning, and there wasn’t one,” he said.</p>

      <p>He said his truck got some distance along the street, before one length of lights caught the top of the vehicle.</p>
      <p>He and a colleague used a ladder to remove some of the lights from the truck.</p>
      <p>Cottesloe Council acting deputy-chief executive officer Neil Hartley said the lights were a project by business lobby ProCott, which has been contacted for comment.</p>
