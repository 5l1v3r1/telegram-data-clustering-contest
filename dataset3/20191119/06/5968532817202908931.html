      <p>The <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/fitbit-versa-2-review-1023127/">Fitbit Versa 2</a> is one of the better wearable experiences of 2019, coming in at a reasonable $200 price tag. Still a little too dear for you? Then this deal is definitely up your alley.</p>
      <p>Amazon has slashed the price of the smartwatch from $199.95 to <a href="http://tyvm.ly/h9keTw">$149</a>, saving you $50.95 in the process. That equates to a 25% discount, and it applies to all variants bar the Special Edition (which has seen a price drop from $229 to $179 anyway).</p>
      <p>Opt for this Fitbit Versa 2 deal and you’re getting a smartwatch with <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/amazon-alexa-878058/">Amazon Alexa</a> integration, smartphone notifications, quick replies via voice, and a sleep mode to save juice and kill notifications.</p>
      <p>Fitbit’s smartwatch also has quite a few fitness-related features (as you’d expect), including step tracking, heart-rate monitoring, goal-based exercises, and support for generic exercises. The one downside is that the Versa 2 uses connected GPS rather than built-in GPS, so you’ll need to take your phone along if you want more accurate metrics.</p>
      <p>“It’s safe to say the Fitbit Versa 2 is one of the best smartwatches available for $200, especially for Android users,” our own Jimmy Westenberg noted in his <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/fitbit-versa-2-review-1023127/">Fitbit Versa 2 review</a>. Jimmy also said similarly priced Wear OS watches are “a little clunky” and noted that the $200 <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/samsung-galaxy-watch-active-review-970667/">Galaxy Watch Active</a> has issues with fitness tracking accuracy. </p>
      <p>In other words, the Fitbit smartwatch is a good deal at $200 and it’s even better at $149. Want to take advantage of this promotion? Then you can check out the Fitbit Versa 2 deal on Amazon via the button below.</p>
