      <p>Gordon Ramsay reportedly spent almost $65,000 to secure Ed Sheeran to perform at his daughter Tilly'sÂ 18th birthday party.<br/><br/>The celebrity chef, 53, hosted an extravagant James Bond-themed bash for his daughter, full name Matilda, at London's exclusive Cuckoo Club on Saturday, which included chart-topper Ed performing a five-song set, according to Britain's The Sun newspaper.<br/><br/>Following his main performance, the star, who charges $64,740 for private shows, apparently led the crowd, including the teenager's pals Brooklyn and Romeo Beckham, to sing a rendition of Happy Birthday.<br/><br/>A source told the publication: "Tilly's bash was next level. It was clear Gordon had spared no expense in making sure it really was a night to remember.<br/><br/>"Ed is Tilly's favorite singer so it meant the world to her that he was there, even though his set didn't come cheap," they continued. "The whole party had a James Bond theme, with drinks topped with her face or the 007 logo and guests encouraged to come in black tie. There was even a 007 ice sculpture which you could drink shots out of."<br/><br/>Prior to the celebrations, the pair spent some quality father-daughter time together, and shared a fun clip on Instagram of them changing from their everyday clothes into their costumes for the big night out.<br/><br/>Gordon shares five kids with his wife Tana, 45, including daughter Megan, 21, twins Jack and Holly, 19, and son Oscar, seven months.</p>
