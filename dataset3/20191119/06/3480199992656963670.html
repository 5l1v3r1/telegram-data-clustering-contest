      <p>Steven Frederick Jackson, 57, sent messages to the ‘girl’ over the course of six weeks in February and March last year.</p>
      <p>Over the course of the communication, the decoy, an adult woman, constantly reminded him she was aged 13, but Jackson continued to send messages.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Wendy Miller told Shrewsbury Crown Court: “He made references to her bottom, said she could be a model and that he wanted to kiss her.</p>
      <p>“He was messaging her nearly on a daily basis and asked her to send photos.</p>
      <p>“He said he wished he was the same age as her and that he wanted a relationship.</p>
      <p>“He later said she should block him because he had dangerous ideas.”</p>
      <p>But the messages didn’t stop, and Jackson booked a hotel room in Derby, asked her if she was bringing her pyjamas and arranged to meet her at McDonald’s.</p>
      <h3>Motivations</h3>
      <p>At this point the decoy handed the information to police. She arrived at the fast food restaurant with two men to confront Jackson. He was then arrested.</p>
      <p>Police also seized his laptop which revealed three Category C images of child sexual abuse.</p>
      <p>Jackson, of Benthall View, Madeley, admitted making indecent images of children and arranging or facilitating the commission of a child sex offence.</p>
      <p>Kevin Jones, defending, said: “It aggravates everything when there are hotel rooms booked and plans made.</p>
      <p>“This is a man who has extremely low self-esteem and has had problems with relationships in the past.</p>
      <p>"He was seeking some sort of comfort from this contact.”</p>
      <p>Judge Peter Barrie told Jackson: “It is clear that there were sexual motivations behind the arrangement.</p>
      <p>"You had been messaging her for six weeks to try and form a bond.”</p>
      <p>He sentenced Jackson to a community order for 24 months, 45 rehabilitation days, 80 hours unpaid work and ordered him to go on a sexual offenders prevention programme.</p>
