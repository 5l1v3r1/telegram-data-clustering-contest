      <h3>THE TRAVELLER</h3>
      <p>Susie Porter, award-winning actor and ambassador for World Animal Protection, has a leading role in the Foxtel TV prison drama <i>Wentworth</i>, and is now shooting <i>Hungry Ghosts</i>, a new SBS drama.</p>
      <h3>NUMBER OF COUNTRIES VISITED</h3>
      <p>About 13</p>
      <h3>ANY PASSPORT MISHAPS?</h3>
      <p>happily, none. I'm anal before I travel and have a list of everything I can't forget, checking my passport, how long's left on it, visas, everything.</p>

      <h3>I GOT MY FIRST PASSPORT WHEN I WAS</h3>
      <p>18. I was a bit of a late starter. Growing up, my parents used to travel overseas on their own and billet us kids out to other people – I absolutely hated it – and we only ever travelled as a family in Australia. So my first trip was for a holiday in the UK.</p>
      <h3>MY PASSPORT PHOTO IS</h3>
      <p>not so good. It looks a lot like my Wentworth prison mug shot.</p>
      <h3>I CAN'T STOP GOING BACK TO</h3>
      <p>London. I lived there for a number of years and my husband is from England so I have in-laws and lots of friends to visit. But I also just love it as a city and go at least once a year. I love the parks, the great restaurants, the exhibitions, the V &amp; A, the little laneway art galleries … I don't know that I'd want to live there again, but it's wonderful to visit.</p>
      <h3>MY LAST TRAVEL DESTINATION WAS</h3>
      <p>Thailand and Laos. I'm one of the ambassadors for World Animal Protection and I've been doing some work with animals who are used in entertainment. I visited the Mandalao Elephant Conservation sanctuary in Laos to see some of the elephants rescued from giving rides to tourists. They say if you can get close enough to a wild animal to ride it or wash it or take a selfie with it, there's been cruelty involved. Then I went to Thailand's ChangChill which recently changed from a traditional elephant camp for entertainment to a place that's truly elephant-friendly where you can watch them in their natural habitat being elephants. It was beautiful.</p>
      <h3>MY NEXT TRAVEL DESTINATION IS</h3>
      <p>Switzerland and Germany for the Christmas markets with my family – my mum, sisters and their partners and three nephews. We arrive in Zurich and then get on a boat up the Rhine before shooting off to Amsterdam.</p>
      <h3>I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO</h3>
      <p>cruising around the markets with my family, eating Swiss chocolate and then walking it off.</p>
      <h3>WHAT I REALLY WANT FROM MY NEXT TRIP IS</h3>
      <p>seeing three countries I've never been to before.</p>
      <h3>I LOVE TO TRAVEL BECAUSE</h3>
      <p>it opens your mind. I love seeing other countries and having different experiences.</p>
      <h3>MY TRAVEL PHILOSOPHY IS</h3>
      <p>to check out good restaurants and theatre before you go, and book them up, so you have something already organised.</p>
      <h3>THE ONE TRAVEL MISTAKE I ALWAYS MAKE IS</h3>
      <p>over packing. I always take my gym gear, but it never comes out of my case. Ever.</p>
      <h3>THE ONE THING I REALLY DO GET RIGHT WHEN I TRAVEL IS</h3>
      <p>being organised. I contact my bank, make sure my passport is up to date and that I have all the right adaptors. And my list. That way, I never forget anything.</p>
      <h3>IF I HAD TO SIT IN THE MIDDLE SEAT THE PASSENGERS I'D WANT ON EITHER SIDE OF ME WOULD BE</h3>
      <p>Larry David, the creator of <i>Seinfeld</i>, because he's the funniest bloke going. And on the other side, my absolute favourite actress, Jessica Lang, to get some acting tips and pick her brain.</p>
      <h3>THE ONE FAMOUS TRAVELLER I REALLY ADMIRE IS</h3>
      <p>Amelia Earhart, who flew solo across the Atlantic Ocean in 1932. I think she was incredible, firstly because she was a woman doing that in the 1930s, and secondly because she later gave her life for her attempt to fly around the world.</p>
      <h3>THE ONE FAMOUS PERSON I'D LIKE TO TRAVEL WITH IS</h3>
      <p>no one. I wouldn't like to travel with someone famous because you'd never get any peace. I wouldn't like that at all.</p>
      <h3>AIRLINE FOOD IS</h3>
      <p>generally dependent on which class you're travelling in. But I pre-order a vegetarian meal and, as I love flying, I never complain about anything. I just love the idea of being in the air and the fact no one can contact you, and you either sit or lie down and watch movies and people bring food to you. How fabulous is that!</p>
      <h3>AIRPORT SECURITY IS</h3>
      <p>often unnecessarily rude. That doesn't happen in Australia so much, but in some other countries it seems that airport security is playing power games.</p>
      <h3>HOTELS ARE</h3>
      <p>a lovely luxury. My husband put me onto the Mr &amp; Mrs Smith boutique hotels app so we book great hotels, with big, comfy beds and good room service. I love them.</p>
      <h3>I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO GO TO</h3>
      <p>Greece for its distinct and different culture and the history which I studied at school; the Galapagos for the incredible wildlife; and Iceland which would be so interesting.</p>
      <h3>I'VE NEVER WANTED TO GO TO</h3>
      <p>Dubai. It has just never interested me.</p>
      <h3>AISLE OR WINDOW?</h3>
      <p>Aisle, so I can get up easily and escape when I need to.</p>
