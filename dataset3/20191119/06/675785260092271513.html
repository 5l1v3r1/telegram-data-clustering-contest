      <h1>Richard Keys defends Sky Sports axe and launches attack on Jamie Carragher</h1>
      <h2>Richard Keys left Sky Sports in 2011 amid a sexism storm but insists Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher was welcomed back despite spitting at a football fan</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T06:39:16+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 06:39</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>Richard Keys has defended his behaviour that led to his departure from Sky Sports - and launched a stinging attack on Jamie Carragher.</p>
      <p>Keys departed Sky in 2011 alongside punditry partner Andy Gray amid an sexism storm.</p>
      <p>Keys and Gray had been heard discussing off-air, the appointment of Sian Massey-Ellis as an official for a Premier League match, stating 'women don't know the offside rule'.</p>
      <p>Another off-air clip surfaced of former presenter Keys asking Jamie Redknapp if he "smashed it" in reference to an ex-girlfriend.</p>
      <p>Almost nine years has passed since the departure with Keys and Gray now fronting Premier League coverage in Doha.</p>

      <p>While he accepts his conduct was sexist, Keys insists it is the sort of thing that goes on in the workplace and dressing rooms.</p>
      <p>"Was it sexist? Looking at it now, yes it was. Was it disrespectful? Yes, it was. Was it said in a public arena? No," <a href="https://theathletic.co.uk/1387749/2019/11/19/dinosaurs-ruled-the-world-for-300-million-years-so-if-thats-what-i-am-so-be-it-keys-and-gray-on-life-after-sky/?redirected=1">he told the Athletic</a>.</p>
      <p>"Should a mobile phone been recording our studio that day? A studio is like a football dressing room, it’s a boisterous place.</p>
      <p>"No different happened in that studio than did in any dressing room that morning anywhere in the UK.”</p>

      <p>Keys went on to hit out at Sky over their decision to retain <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> legend Carragher as one of their pundits.</p>
      <p>In March 2018, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/jamie-carragher-spits-football-fan-12169442">the Mirror obtained footage</a> of Carragher spitting at a football fan and his daughter from his car window.</p>
      <p>He was suspended until the end of that season but has since returned as one of their leading pundits.</p>

      <p>Keys adds: "Look at the things that have happened. I didn’t go downstairs to the dressing room door, knock on it and spit in her face.</p>
      <p>"And yet the guy that committed a criminal offence in a public arena, spitting in the face of a 14-year-old girl, was later welcomed back by Sky as a hero,” says Keys.</p>
      <p>“Now, come on. Are there any similarities? I don’t think so.”</p>
