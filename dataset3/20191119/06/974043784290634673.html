      <h1>Pockets of work done; soils still have a long way to go</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T06:10:43+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 06:10</time> by <a rel="author">Siobhán Walsh</a></address>
      <p>The last few days have allowed for some drying in our soils, but this is from a very wet base. Pockets of the country were able to get work done – pulling beet and digging potatoes, while there were even bits and pieces ploughed and sowed with winter cereals over the weekend.</p>
      <p>However, the situation is still bleak for winter crops and it’s not likely that winter cropping area will increase dramatically before the spring time. Rain is also due this week.</p>
      <p>On last estimates – November 7 – <i>AgriLand</i> had winter cereal planting figures at 35% in some parts of the country and 80% in other areas.</p>
      <p>The areas worst affected were counties Meath and Wexford, which were as low as 35-40%.</p>
      <h3>Soil moisture deficits</h3>
      <p>On Saturday, November 18, soil moisture deficits (SMDs) had improved somewhat. Many well and moderately-drained soils were either at field capacity or were 1-3mm away from field capacity.</p>
      <p>Some poorly-drained soils had also come away from saturation point, but were still well above field capacity at figures from -5 to -10.</p>

      <p>This is in comparison to Wednesday of last week, November 14, when well-drained soils were at field capacity.</p>
      <p>At the same time, all poorly-drained soils were at saturation point, while much of the moderately-drained soils were also at saturation point (-10). However, the northern part of the country looked slightly better with figures ranging from -3 to -9.</p>
