      <h1>Sheep trade: Base quotes up 20c/kg on last week, as the kill jumps by over 8,000 head</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T06:00:26+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Michael Geary</a></address>
      <p>There is more good news for sheep farmers this week, as factory base quotes have increased by as much as 20c/kg on last week.</p>
      <p>As some meat processing facilities struggle to source spring lambs for slaughter; the bargaining power is firmly in the hands of the farmer.</p>
      <p>Currently, farmers are securing prices of <b>between 475c/kg and 480c/kg</b> including quality assurance (QA) bonuses.</p>
      <p>However, some farmers say, those who are involved in producer groups are starting to secure prices as high as <b>490c/kg</b>.</p>
      <h3>Quotes</h3>
      <p>This week, Kildare Chilling (Monday quote) is offering a base price of 470c/kg + 10c/kg QA – <b>up 10c/kg on last week</b> (payable up to a carcass of 22kg).</p>
      <p>Irish Country Meats (Monday quote) is offering a base price of 460c/kg + 10c/kg – <b>up 20c/kg on last week</b> (payable up to a carcass of 22kg).</p>
      <p>And, finally, Kepak Athleague (Monday quote) is offering a base price of 460c/kg + 15c/kg – <b>up 20c/kg on last week</b> (payable up to a carcass of 22kg).</p>
      <p>Overall, when the QA is factored in, this leaves <b>quotes at 475-480c/kg</b>.</p>
      <p>In addition, cast ewes are making 250-260c/kg in sheep processing plants – <b>up 10c/kg on last week</b> (payable up to a carcass of 40kg).</p>
