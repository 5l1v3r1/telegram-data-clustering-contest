      <h1>Kubica admits blame for only one 2019 crash</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/robert-kubica/"><b>Robert Kubica</b></a> claims he is responsible for only one of his crashes in 2019.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T06:36:57+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 06:36</time> by <a rel="author">GMM F1</a></address>
      <p>The Pole's inspirational F1 comeback will end after next weekend's Abu Dhabi finale, but he has been linked with a reserve role for 2020.</p>
      <p>2019 has been abysmal for both the 34-year-old, who has notably struggled alongside rookie <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/george-russell/"><b>George Russell</b></a>, and the cash-strapped backmarker Williams.</p>
      <p>Kubica's biggest complaint has been the inconsistent handling of his car.</p>
      <p>Notably, he crashed in Baku but also last weekend in Brazil, but he takes personal responsibility only for a qualifying crash in Japan.</p>
      <p>"I crashed in Japan, which was my mistake. So out of those three cases, I blame myself only once," he said.</p>
      <p>"In Baku, it was a miracle that the accident did not happen earlier," added Kubica.</p>
      <p>"It makes no sense to go back and look into the details now, but considering the situation we were in, it's a miracle that nothing happened to me before that."</p>
