      <h1>Vettel-Leclerc lineup a 'luxury' for Ferrari - boss</h1>
      <h2>Even after they crashed in Brazil, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/formula-1/ferrari/"><b>Ferrari</b></a> boss <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mattia-binotto/"><b>Mattia Binotto</b></a> still says having both <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/sebastian-vettel/"><b>Sebastian Vettel</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/charles-leclerc/"><b>Charles Leclerc</b></a> on the team is "a luxury".</h2>

      <p>However, as the duo is summoned to Maranello for crisis talks this week, the Italian press is not signing up to that explanation.</p>
      <p>"It's not fair to blame Ferrari for the handling of its two star drivers," said La Gazzetta dello Sport.</p>
      <p>"But when you have two alpha animals under the same roof, you have to expect such incidents."</p>
      <p>Indeed, Ferrari has had the bulk of its success in the past by appointing drivers with clear number 1 and number 2 status.</p>
      <p>Instead, "A generational conflict has exploded that will now be hard to calm down", Corriere dello Sport declared.</p>
      <p>Tuttosport agrees: "Leclerc will not stick to the hierarchy, leading to a destabilisation of Vettel who has made many mistakes this year."</p>
      <p>La Repubblica said: "This rivalry can have severe consequences for 2020."</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, boss Binotto is clinging to his earlier line about Ferrari's current driver lineup being a "luxury" for the Italian team.</p>
      <p>"I'm still convinced that it is a luxury because they are both good drivers. Very good drivers," he said.</p>
      <p>"They are both a good benchmark for the other and we have seen how they have improved. Seb in the second half was certainly very fast.</p>
      <p>"So I think overall it is still a luxury."</p>
      <p>A Ferrari spokesperson confirmed reports that the drivers' regular joint press appointment was cancelled late on Sunday in the wake of the crash.</p>
      <p>However, Binotto insists they still have a "good relationship".</p>
      <p>He also dismissed suggestions that he should simply copy <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/toto-wolff/"><b>Toto Wolff</b></a>'s approach to driver management, after the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/formula-1/mercedes/"><b>Mercedes</b></a> boss once drew up a written list of guidelines for the warring <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/lewis-hamilton/"><b>Lewis Hamilton</b></a> and Nico Rosberg to follow.</p>
      <p>"I don't know what Toto did, I don't want to judge that and I'm not interested either," Binotto said.</p>
