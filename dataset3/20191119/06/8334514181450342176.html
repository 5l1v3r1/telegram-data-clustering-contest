      <p>MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Football Federation Australia has handed lengthy bans to four members of the country’s Olympic squad for “unprofessional conduct” at the end of an under-23 tournament in Cambodia in March following a complaint from a woman.</p>
      <p>Nathaniel Atkinson, Lachlan Wales and Brandon Wilson were banned until Aug. 10 2020, meaning they will miss the Tokyo Olympics. Captain Riley McGree was banned until April 1 next year.</p>
      <p>All four would participate in “education courses and counselling” as directed by the governing body, the FFA said in a statement on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The four were found to have breached the FFA’s code of conduct during a night out at the end of the Asian Football Confederation U-23 championship qualifying tournament.</p>
      <p>“Specifically, the FFA Board found that the players engaged in unprofessional conduct,” the FFA said.</p>
      <p>“The matter came to the attention of FFA in April, 2019 following a complaint by a woman.”</p>
      <p>It was unclear what the nature of the complaint was.</p>
      <p>State broadcaster ABC reported the complaint had been made earlier in the year to government funding agency Sport Australia.</p>
      <p>The FFA said it had launched an investigation shortly after receiving the complaint but that it had taken months to complete due to its “complexity”.</p>
      <p>The players were due to travel to China on Nov. 9 to prepare for the AFC U-23 championship in January but were held back pending the sanction. They have recourse to appeal the decision to an independent committee, the FFA said.</p>
      <p>“These sanctions are commensurate to the nature of the breaches,” FFA Chairman Chris Nikou said.</p>
      <p>“Upholding our commitment to respect and responsibility cannot be compromised.</p>
      <p>“The players have understood the gravity of their actions and have positively commenced respectful relationship programs that will ensure they appreciate these values in the future.”</p>
