      <h2>Doyle’s two late points ensured a famous one-point win for the Carlow champions over Rathdowney-Errill on Sunday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T06:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/pat-nolan/" target="_blank">Pat Nolan</a></address>
      <p>St Mullins hero James Doyle has said they resolved to reach the Leinster final for Micheal Ryan’s sake.</p>
      <p>Doyle’s two late points - he hit five in total - ensured a famous one-point win for the Carlow champions over Rathdowney-Errill on Sunday as they reached a first ever provincial decider.</p>
      <p>It came a fortnight after they shocked 2017 and ‘18 All-Ireland champions Cuala in the previous round, also by the bare minimum, on what was a surreal day for all concerned.</p>
      <p>Micheal Ryan, a team selector, suffered a heart attack during the game and three ambulances arrived on the field afterwards, with his son Oisin, who had been introduced as a sub, withdrawn from the action given the circumstances.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, Mr Ryan is recovering well and watched Sunday’s dramatic win from his hospital bed in Dublin. It hoped that he will return home this week.</p>
      <p>Doyle said: “We knew going out that we had to do it, not alone for ourselves but we had to do it for him, he's such a great club man and such a passionate club man as well.</p>
      <p>“Look, that was definitely a motivation for us, to go out there and drive it on.”</p>
      <p>The players and supporters could bask in the glory of Sunday’s win, unlike a fortnight earlier.</p>
      <p>Reflecting on the aftermath of the Cuala victory, Doyle continued: “We didn't know what was going on near the end of the match. We only heard it after the match.</p>
      <p>“Look, it was devastating. No club, no person wants to hear that news. Thankfully he's on the mend and look, only for him now we wouldn't be here.”</p>

      <p>Eking out results has been a hallmark of St Mullins’ run to the final, in which they will play All-Ireland champions Ballyhale Shamrocks on Sunday week.</p>
      <p>“Look, the last two games - the county final and then against Cuala - look, we've been in this situation for the last two games.</p>
      <p>“We've only won by a point in our last two games as well so we'd been in this situation.</p>
      <p>“We know just to keep the head and just to keep the focus and drive on and look, we got the win and we'll look forward to two weeks' time.</p>
      <p>“We haven't really played against them much in the last couple of years, we never got the chance.</p>
      <p>“Look, the chance now is coming for us in two weeks' time and look, we'll look forward to it and look, we'll give it our best shot and look, we won't fear them anyway,” Doyle insisted.</p>
      <p>And, after beating the All-Ireland champions of 2017 and ‘18, there’s no obvious reason why they should fear the current Tommy Moore Cup holders.</p>
      <p>“Without a doubt we have belief in ourselves. We wouldn't be here if we didn't have that.</p>
      <p>“Like I said, everyone is just so passionate about the club and we know what we can do and we definitely won't fear Ballyhale anyway.”</p>
      <p>It’s just the second time ever that a Carlow club has reached the Leinster senior club final, the previous occasion being in 2013 when St Mullins’ rivals Mount Leinster Rangers scored a famous win over Oulart-The Ballagh.</p>
      <p>Doyle added: “What they did was absolutely fantastic but look, we have to focus on our own game and focus on what we can do. Look, all we can do is go back to the drawing board on Tuesday night and look forward to two weeks' time.”</p>
