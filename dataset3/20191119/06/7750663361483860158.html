      <h1>Sao Paulo offers to pay 'fee' for F1 race</h1>
      <h2>Sao Paulo is prepared to pay a "fee" to keep the Brazilian GP at Interlagos.</h2>

      <p>Earlier in 2019, the future of the race became clouded when controversial president Jair Bolsonaro said the chance of a switch to Rio de Janeiro is "99 per cent".</p>
      <p>It is believed one of the factors in Rio's favour is that, currently, the promoters of the Brazilian GP do not pay an annual race fee to Liberty Media.</p>
      <p>But Sao Paulo governor Joao Doria told La Gazzetta dello Sport: "In the next contract there will be the fee."</p>
      <p>Last weekend at the race, Doria met with race promoter Tamas Rohonyi and F1 CEO <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/chase-carey/"><b>Chase Carey</b></a>. Doria said a "decisive" follow-up meeting with Carey will take place in early December.</p>
      <p>"We will gather with Liberty, Chase Carey, Tamas and representatives of the Prefecture of Sao Paulo," he confirmed.</p>
      <p>"For what depends on us, the state and the prefecture, Formula 1 can continue in Interlagos for another ten years."</p>
      <p>Doria said part of the new deal will be a renaming of the race.</p>
      <p>"We already have a proposal ready: GP Sao Paulo del Brasil. It is part of a communication strategy of the Sao Paulo government to attract international tourists," he declared.</p>
      <p>"We are discussing the final details with Liberty."</p>
