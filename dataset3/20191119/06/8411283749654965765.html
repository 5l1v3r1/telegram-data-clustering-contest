      <h1>Unimicron to invest more for ABF substrate capacity expansion in China</h1>

      <p>Taiwan-based PCB and IC substrate supplier Unimicron Technology has disclosed plans to invest a total of about US$74.9 million for capacity expansions at its plants in China in 2020.</p>
      <p>In a company statement Unimicron said some US$50 million of the investment will go to the firm's plant in Suzhou for expanding production for IC substrates, mainly ABF substrates, and US$6.9 million to its existing plant in Huangshi dedicated to general-specs PCB and HDI products. The remaining US$18 million will be injected into its brand-new plant, also in Huangshi, which is expected to make high-end HDI and IC substrates.</p>
      <p>Unimicron president CM Lee said ABF substrates are increasingly needed to process high-end chips for ever-growing 5G and AI applications, prompting his company to invest more in capacity expansion for the substrates.</p>
      <p>Lee continued that Unimicron will not build any new HDI production line in 2020 but will carry out equipment replacement at its existing production lines, due partly to high cost involved and partly to HDI having yet to be in significantly short supply.</p>
      <p>Unimicron has reported that its third-quarter 2019 revenues hit a new quarterly high of NT$22.95 billion (US$699.96 million), with net earnings for the quarter surging 28.4% on year to an eight-year high of NT$1.26 billion.</p>
      <p>The impressive performance was attributed to strong sales of ABF substrates for networking applications and robust shipments of BT substrates, HDI boards and PCB products for use in handsets and other consumer electronics devices.</p>
