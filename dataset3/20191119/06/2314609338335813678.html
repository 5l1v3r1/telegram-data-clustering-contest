      <h1>Strong Hawks on track for Dingley relocation by end of 2022</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T06:49:03+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 06:49</time> by <a rel="author">Peter Ryan</a></address>
      <p>After recording another multi-million dollar profit, Hawthorn say they are on track to build their elite training, administration and community centre in Dingley by the end of 2022, with close to $29 million already gained via fundraising to pay for the ambitious project.</p>
      <p>The Hawks have declared the next six months as being critical to realising their vision as they look to secure planning approval and further funding for the initiative which is budgeted to eventually cost the club $110 million.</p>
      <p>The club says the Kennedy Community Centre project will be transformative by establishing the premier sporting and community precinct in the south-east of Melbourne as they work towards realising their goal of winning 20 premierships by 2050 and two premierships within the next five years.</p>
      <p>The Hawks are yet to confirm any government funding for the project with the ALP's loss in the federal election in May meaning they were unable to fulfil a pre-election commitment of $20 million towards the Kennedy Community Centre. The club is continuing to work on that front while the club's foundation aims to raise more funds towards the centre.</p>
      <p>However, the Hawks are only waiting on a planning scheme amendment lodged with Kingston City Council to be approved for work to begin, with a decision on that amendment expected soon.</p>
      <p>They say their strong cash position leaves them well placed to proceed with the project.</p>
      <p>The Hawks announced they had achieved a net surplus of $2.15 million in the 2018-2019 financial year despite navigating a challenging fixture and missing finals. The club once again achieved record membership and averaged more than 40,000 spectators at the Hawks' seven home games in Melbourne.</p>
      <p>Hawthorn chief executive Justin Reeves said the club's strategy remained on track as they looked to make the leap from Waverley.</p>
      <p>"A strong balance sheet provides the club with the capacity to continue to grow as we move towards commencing work on the most transformational project in our history, the Kennedy Community Centre," Reeves said.</p>

      <p>"We are optimistic that with the backing of the entire Hawthorn family, we can take significant steps in realising our vision whilst staying focused on what we need to achieve year to year."</p>
      <p>With two years remaining on their contract with the Tasmanian government - a deal that has seen them play games in Launceston for the past 18 seasons - the Hawks left the door open for the partnership to be renewed beyond 2021.</p>
      <p>The Hawks' ongoing presence in Tasmania will continue to be debated as the Tasmanian AFL Taskforce moves closer to presenting a business case by the end of the year and momentum grows for an AFL team to be based in Tasmania. Hawthorn said they were working in conjunction with the taskforce but remained committed to Tasmania.</p>
      <p>They set a membership record for the 13th season in succession with 82,211 members, including a record number of 9,564 Tasmanian members.</p>
