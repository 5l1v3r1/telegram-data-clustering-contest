      <p><b>NCT</b>'s <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/johnny">Johnny</a>, comedian <b>Park Gyu Sun</b>, and actor <b>Shin Yeon Suk</b> will be appearing as the newest members of <b>SBS Plus</b>'s ongoing variety program, '<b>Everybody Cha Cha Cha</b>'!</p>
      <p>After losing pitifully 1:32 last week in a soccer match, the members of 'Everybody Cha Cha Cha's celebrity soccer team will be turning to their new members to bring them to a new level. NCT member Johnny was selected due to his experience playing volleyball during his school days, while comedian Park Gyu Sun is well-known for his goalkeeping skills. Actor Shim Yeon Suk, also, made the other cast members gape in awe when he showcased his honed soccer skills. </p>
      <p>You can catch this week's episode of SBS Plus's 'Everybody Cha Cha Cha' on November 19 at 10PM KST!</p>
