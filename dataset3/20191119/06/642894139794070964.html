      <p>The TVET Campus Connection Programme (TCCP) is part of a renewed commitment by government to support TVET (Technical and Vocational Education and Training) colleges by providing high-speed, broadband connectivity for administration, teaching and learning.</p>
      <p>In January 2019, the Access connection portion of the programme kicked off with a Request for Proposal (RFP) process. The requirement was to support the strengthening of broadband connections at 325 campuses across 50 TVETs. A number of achievements have been realised.</p>
      <p>The RFP process has resulted in eight service providers being contracted to provide 200Mbps connections between the SANReN (South African National Research Network) and 223 campuses and to upgrade 51 already connected campuses from 100Mbps to 200Mbps per connection. Negotiations continue with TVETs regarding 18 campus connections. The remaining 33 campuses have been withdrawn from consideration for reasons such as merging of sites and lack of need.</p>
      <p>From a technology perspective, the intention of the project was to minimise the wireless options and move towards fibre options, where cost-effective to do so. This is important in order to achieve a degree of ‘futureproofing’. </p>
      <p>Preference was given to dark fibre, managed fibre and then wireless technology. Through the competitive RFP process, it was possible to provide a greater number of more reliable fibre connections than originally anticipated.</p>

      <p>The South African Broadband Educational Networks (SABEN) has engaged the suppliers and TVET colleges in the detailed roll-out planning, and this should be completed by mid-November 2019. The first go-live connections can be expected in the first quarter of 2020.</p>
      <p>In addition to the abovementioned progress, it is important to note the inherent value that will be provided through these new and upgraded connections of the TVET campuses to the SANReN.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The connections will provide a minimum of 200Mbps connection speed (where some of the connections being replaced are 5 and 10 Mbps ADSL connections);</li>
        <li>The connection speed will be upgradeable;</li>
        <li>The synchronous connections provide equal upload and download speeds;</li>
        <li>There is no data cap/limitation, contention, throttling or shaping on the connections; and</li>
        <li>SABEN provides a 24/7 call centre with real-time monitoring and management of the connections.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The essential characteristics of the SANReN are set out in the following diagram and associated notes:</p>

      <p>The next phase of the TCCP will address WiFi for TVET campuses. A national survey of installed WiFi at the campuses of 48 TVET colleges was conducted in September and October 2019. The results of the survey will inform options for the project.</p>
      <p>An ancillary component to the Access connection portion of the programme is the implementation of WiFi connectivity on all TVET college campuses. In planning this component, it became evident that there was insufficient knowledge about each TVET college campus for the TCCP team to create a viable WiFi implementation and deployment project plan. </p>
      <p>To address this need, the TCCP team assembled a small team to visit each TVET college to collect information about the physical infrastructure of each TVET college’s network, WiFi infrastructure, if any, and capacity development needs.</p>
      <p>The gathering of the information was called the TCCP TVET Technical Census. A questionnaire was developed and loaded on to tablets, and the TCCP census takers entered answers to the set of questions into a tablet. At the end of the question session with a TVET, the answers were uploaded to the cloud. </p>
      <p>The answers will then be pooled and analysed, and used to provide a viable and meaning WiFi deployment plan and a capacity development plan.</p>
      <p>It will take about two months to gather the data and a further month to analyse the data and write a WiFi and capacity deployment plan.</p>
