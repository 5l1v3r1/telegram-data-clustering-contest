      <p>Ethiopia, China and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) have agreed today to further strengthen collaboration on improving the agricultural system in Ethiopia, in particular the livestock value chain development. This agreement will support Ethiopia in creating a modern and a highly productive agriculture system and promote trade.</p>
      <p>A Joint Declaration was signed by Ethiopia’s Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), the General Administration of Customs of China (GACC) and UNIDO, with the overall objective of contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The cooperation will focus on capacity-building for food safety; promotion of bilateral trade between Ethiopia and China; and knowledge sharing on relevant best practices, regulations and technical standards.</p>
      <p>The cooperation is designed and to be implemented within the framework of the South-South and triangular cooperation (SSTC) and Ethiopia’s Programme for Country Partnership (PCP). It also aims to fulfil the Memorandum of Understanding signed between UNIDO and GACC on 26 April 2019 on enhancing cooperation, including within PCP framework to promote inclusive and sustainable industrial development (ISID) and trade facilitation in developing countries. Moreover, a livestock value chain development project in Ethiopia, which is being implemented by MOA, GACC and UNIDO, will also benefit from this enhanced cooperation. The livestock project is funded by the contribution of the Chinese government for South-South cooperation through UNIDO.</p>
