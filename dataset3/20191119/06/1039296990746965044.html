      <h1>Royal Enfield motorcycle configurator introduced</h1>

      <p>The new Royal Enfield configurator allows you customise their bikes with accessories like panniers, exhausts, touring seat options and alloy wheels.</p>
      <p>Royal Enfield recently introduced an online motorcycle configurator which allows users to customise the company's models online. The configurator also shows buyers how the customised model will end up looking if they chose to equip it with the factory-fitted accessories.</p>
      <p>Customers can accessorise their bikes with engine guards, panniers, rear luggage rack, a touring seat and alloy wheels. The manufacturer says these genuine accessories come with a two year warranty. Royal Enfield are calling this the ‘Make Your Own’ initiative and are rolling it out in 141 stores across 6 cities - Delhi NCR, Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad, Mumbai and Pune.</p>
      <p>In the initial stage, Make Your Own will only be applicable for customers who are booking the latest Classic 350 that has been launched in two new colours - Mercury SIlver and Pure Black. It will be extended to the other Royal Enfield models in a phased manner.</p>
      <p>The accessory list for the Classic 350 is quite extensive. It includes 16 different exhaust options and over half a dozen luggage and protection options. The company has alloy wheels on offer. We spent some time on the configurator and managed to add Rs 36,000 of additional equipment on the Classic 350.</p>
