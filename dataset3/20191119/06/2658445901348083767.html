      <p>Super Eagles Coach, Gernot Rohr has described the 4-2 win over Lesotho in the 2021 AFCON Qualifiers as the best result by the Super Eagles on a synthetic pitch.</p>
      <p>He, however, lauded Victor Osimhen, for his contribution in the win. “It was one of the best results on a synthetic pitch which is not easy to play. Again they got a goal in the beginning and we had to react.</p>
      <p>“But we now know that the confidence they (Eagles) have because they play good football and when they play good football, you can have the goals and the goals are coming very nice; constructive goals and Osimhen is on the right way to be a good scorer and also not to forget players like Odion Ighalo.</p>
      <p>“I think Osimhen is on the way to becoming a very important player for us as he scored more goals and he gave also his second goal to his friend, Chukwueze. So he (Osimhen) is working very well in France and I see him often playing and speaking with his coach. We know he still has lots of work to do to progress because he is young and he can do more,” Rohr said.</p>
      <p>He added: “He (Osimhen) changed the second half. It is interesting to see a 3-5-2 with Osimhen and Chukwueze as the twin strikers. So, the second half was better and this match is very important for the future.”</p>
