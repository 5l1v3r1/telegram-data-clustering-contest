      <p>The IVF pregnancy dreams of an <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/eastwood">Eastwood</a> nurse have come true following a £1million lottery win.</p>
      <p>Rebecca Brown, 39, was told by doctors to "have children sooner, rather than later" after she was diagnosed with pre-cancerous cells of the cervix last year, leading to the possible need for a hysterectomy.</p>
      <p>After two rounds of IVF, made financially possible due to her winnings, the 39-year-old is now due to give birth on January, 25, 2020, as a happily single mum.</p>
      <p>“I was poorly last year and I thought, I want to do it, I’ve got to. I was able to pay for it so I did," she told Nottinghamshire Live.</p>
      <p>Rebecca scooped her share of £1 million back in August 2016 as part of a family syndicate with dad David, 64, mum Yvonne, 62, and sister Julie, 36. The four divided their windfall evenly.</p>
      <p>Since then the family claim they've been living their normal lives and aside from jointly buying a holiday home at Lincolnshire's Tattershall Lakes Country Park, as well as a four-person Surrey bike they festively decorate and use to distribute sweets over <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a>, there have been no extravagant outgoings.</p>

      <p>But Rebecca does admit the family's good fortune made IVF an affordable option for her.</p>
      <p>"I always thought I might have wanted children but I was never motivated enough to make it happen," she said, "The hospital told me if I wanted to have children I had to do it sooner rather than later.</p>
      <p>"Then at my last check up they said they might have to do a hysterectomy so that’s when I said to them, if I don’t have to have it, I’m going to have a baby.</p>
      <p>"My dad said 'But you need a man first'</p>
      <p>"I said, no I don’t."</p>
      <p>Seven months later mum-to-be and bump are doing well, with Rebecca choosing to keep the gender a surprise.</p>
      <p>"We do refer to it as a boy and call it Percy but whether it ends up being a Percy remains to be seen," she added.</p>
      <p>Once born 'Percy' will be the family's first grandchild but Rebecca insists there will be no spoiling going on.</p>

      <p>She said: “I don’t want it to be spoilt but everyone has been really generous. Not just mum and dad but my friends and my neighbour.</p>
      <p>"Everyone has been really generous in giving me things and buying me things for the baby."</p>
      <p>Mum Yvonne added: "This baby is going to be brought up normal, it should be like these were brought up.</p>
      <p>"Birthday? Yes. Christmas? Yes. That’s when you get presents. You don’t just have things when you want it."</p>
      <p>The Brown family have been playing the lottery since it began in 1994, today (November 19) marks the game's 25th anniversary.</p>
