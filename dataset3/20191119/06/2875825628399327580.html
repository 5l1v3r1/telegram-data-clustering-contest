      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/mrs-browns-boys">Mrs Brown’s Boys</a> star <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/brendan-ocarroll">Brendan O’Carroll</a> told yesterday of his heart attack scare and how he was rushed to hospital to have life-saving surgery last year.</p>
      <p>Doctors said the Dublin comedy hero was weeks away from heart failure after they found an artery that was 99% blocked.</p>
      <p>They advised him to quit his smoking habit but Brendan, 64, said defiantly he has no intention of stubbing out the killer cigarettes: “No, f**k no. I tried vaping but no.”</p>
      <p>Speaking at a press conference to celebrate the first year of the Mrs. Brown’s Boys FAI Heart Care Programme - which aims to tackle Sudden Adult Death syndrome with heart screenings - Brendan revealed how the programme ended up saving his own life.</p>
      <p>Recalling the initial meetings with FAI Medical Director Dr Alan Byrne last year, to organise the programme, the comedian explained: “The ironic part about this is that on that day, I was suffering from a thing called peripheral artery disease on my legs where I needed to get my arteries opened on my legs.</p>

      <p>“And I live in America and and anytime I could get an appointment in America I was in Ireland, and vice versa so Jenny had suggested on the way down to the reception to launch this that I talk to Dr Alan Byrne about this and try and get an appointment.</p>
      <p>“I wasn’t particularly proud about trying to jump the queue but at the same time I could barely f***ing walk.”</p>
      <p>“So Alan said no problem and got me into the Beacon hospital that Friday.”</p>
      <p>“I told them my story and they said they were going to do about 10 different tests and I said that’s great, ‘let me know the dates for those and I’ll be here’ and he said 'No, we are going to do it today'.</p>
      <p>“And we did them all that day and at one stage he had to put me under an anaesthetic and when I woke up Jenny was there and she said he found a blockage in your heart, he put a stent in.</p>

      <p>“I was in overnight and the next morning he came in and he said he had found an artery that was 99% blocked and that I was one month away from a heart attack, which shocked me.</p>
      <p>“But he said ‘it’s 100% now, in fact when you walk out of here the healthiest part will be your heart’.”</p>
      <p>Laughing about the close call, he went on to explain: “And I said that’s great but what about my leg and he said ‘I don’t do legs’.</p>
      <p>“So I said what the fuck am I doing here?</p>
      <p>“And he said ‘Dr Byrne actually saw you on the Late Late show on St Patrick’s Day and during the interview you were out of breath so he rang the doctor and said, ‘never mind the legs look at his heart.’</p>
      <p>Despite the breathlessness and pains in his legs, Brendan, who jumped straight back into work just days after his surgery, said it wasn’t until six months afterwards that he realised how bad his health really was.</p>
      <p>He told: “I was on the Late Late in London last year and I had been feeling a bit breathless but for some reason, I had gone down to sneak a smoke and then I ran on and I did feel a bit breathless at the time, but he [Dr Byrne] noticed it so it just goes to show you.</p>
      <p>“He was watching it in a hotel, we [Ireland] had a match.</p>
      <p>“The funny thing is, in the six months after the surgery, because literally it was a one day surgery, in the middle of all the tests he did the surgery, but six months after that you start to realise how f**ked I was because it was creeping up on you.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t realise how tired I was.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, his wife and co-star Jenny said she saw the signs long before the doctors found the blockages.</p>
      <p>She said: “It’s funny, after it was all done and he had had the surgery and everything was fine. The amount of people and our own friends that said ‘You looked terrible on The Late Late’.</p>
      <p>She added: “By God I knew it, and I was on to him to get his legs looked at.</p>
      <p>“Even my brother is his GP and I knew he was getting to the stage he couldn’t walk 100 yards without having to stop because his legs would cramp up.</p>
      <p>“So I said, ‘This is not on. You’ve got to get yourself sorted because there is something not right’.</p>
      <p>“I said ‘We are going to fall out about it, but I am going to be this person that is going to nag you, until you get that done’.”</p>
      <p>She also opened up about the fear she felt not knowing whether he would ever come out of the testing room.</p>
      <p>She said: “They said they were going to take him down and they were going to do the angiogram and if they found something they’d treat it while they were there.</p>
      <p>“So I didn’t know when he was going down how it was going to go.</p>
      <p>“It was about an hour and a half afterwards when I was going, okay it was supposed to be about 45 minutes, there is something going on.</p>
      <p>“And then the surgeon walked in and it was like one of those moments in ER drama, where it’s like you think they are going to take off the mask and say ‘We did everything we could’ and he said no we found a blockage.</p>
      <p>“He said he was surprised we didn’t find any more, he said I expected to find about ten. But he said it was 99 percent blocked.</p>
      <p>“They said he would have had a heart attack (if he never got it fixed).</p>
      <p>When asked if it was the pressure of his job that led to the issues, Brendan admitted it was his smoking that caused his scare.</p>
      <p>However, when asked if he was going to give them up, he said: “No, f**k no. I tried vaping but (no).”</p>
      <p>“I’m not a worrier and the only pressure I have is the pressure I decide to put on myself.</p>
      <p>“I’m kind of like, if the Christmas specials needed to be written by October 1, and they weren’t written, I’d just be like ‘I don’t care, I don’t really take life that serious’.</p>
      <p>"Which is surprising because that is what kept me alive. I don’t put pressure on myself.</p>
      <p>“I used to say I eat pressure and I shit results.”</p>

      <p>Jenny interrupted: “He is doing his best. And he has since got the surgery on both legs done and has since then, we are working with the surgeon and he is trying to cut down.</p>
      <p>“There’s no point him sitting there and telling the surgeon he’s not going to smoke, he’s a smoker.</p>
      <p>“He doesn’t drink, he doesn’t do drugs, he smokes and that’s what he does. So he said ‘I’ll do my best’.”</p>
      <p>Brendan and Jenny were speaking at a press conference on Monday in Dublin’s FAI HQ, where they announced the latest phase of their innovative Heart Care programme as it enters its second year in operation.</p>
      <p>The six-year programme, sponsored by Mrs. Brown’s Boys and endorsed by the couple, kicked off last January and already over 1,600 boys and girls have been screened in the National Leagues.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Brown’s Boys have committed €430,000 over six years to the programme which has been developed under the guidance of FAI Medical Director, Dr Alan Byrne.</p>
