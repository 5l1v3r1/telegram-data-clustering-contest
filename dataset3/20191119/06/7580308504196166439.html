      <p>T.I.’s daughter Deyjah Harris, has now deleted her Instagram account following her father’s controversial comments on her sexual health.</p>
      <p>The 18-year-old made the move to go off social media following the <a href="https://guardian.ng/life/reactions-as-t-i-says-he-takes-his-daughter-for-hymen-check-yearly/">backlash that trailed her father’s comments.</a></p>
      <p>Earlier this month, T.I. revealed in an interview with the hosts of the Ladies Like Us podcast that he takes his daughter to the gynaecologist to “check her hymen.”</p>
      <blockquote>“This is the thing,” he said. “Deyjah’s 18, just graduated high school now and she’s attending her first year of college, figuring it out for herself. And yes, not only have we had the conversation, we have yearly trips to the gynecologist to check her hymen.”</blockquote>
      <p>Although doctors have advised him that a broken or torn hymen doesn’t necessarily indicate that a woman has had sex.</p>
      <blockquote>“I said, ‘Look, doc, she don’t ride no horses, she don’t ride no bike, she don’t play no sports, man. Just check the hymen please and give me back my results, expeditiously,” he recalled, laughing along with the show’s co-hosts Nazanin Mandi and Nadia Moham. “But I will say, as of her 18th birthday, her hymen is still intact.”</blockquote>
      <p>This revelation was met with negative reactions from fans and fellow celebrities who condemned the rapper. The podcast hosts have since apologized and removed the episode from streaming services.</p>
      <p>Prior to deactivating her social media accounts, Deyjah unfollowed her father, her stepmother Tiny, and stepsister Zonnique Pullins on social media.</p>
      <p>She later thanked her followers for their support during the public scandal.</p>
