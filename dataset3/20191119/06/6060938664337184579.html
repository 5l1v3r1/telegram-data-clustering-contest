      <p><a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sonam-Kapoor">Sonam Kapoor</a> and Anand Ahuja are the most adorable couple of the tinsel. Whenever they post a lovey-dovey picture on social media their fans go crazy over it. From their sweet social media PDA to their cuddly photos, their <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Instagram">Instagram</a> profiles are all things, love!</p>
      <p>Today also Anand took to his Insta handle to post a photo from their USA vacation wherein they are seen posing with their friends and enjoying a match. In the photo, Sonam is sporting a skirt and top and specs while Anand has opted for simple black denim and grey shirt. Anand shared the picture and simply wrote, “LA ...”</p>
      <p>Recently, during an interview when Anand was asked about wifey Sonam’s fashion and style outings, he said that she is versatile with her clothes and footwear. He admires her fashion choices. But one thing that Anand teases her about is posting all the photos of the gifts she gets and he keeps wondering how can one do such a thing.</p>
