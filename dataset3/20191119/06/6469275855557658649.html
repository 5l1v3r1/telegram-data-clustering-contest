        <b>Manchester United have received a boost in their pursuit of Erling Haaland.</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10367816/man-utd-transfer-offer-goal-erling-braut-haaland-january-loan-back/">The Sun</a> the Red Devils are willing to loan Haaland back to RB Salzburg for the rest of the season if they can complete a deal in January, which could swing the race in their favour.</p>
      <p>A number of top clubs are interested in Haaland, but few seem willing to pay the £85m asking price.</p>
      <p>Haaland already has 26 goals in 18 games this season and is one of the hottest strikers in Europe.</p>
      <p>Manchester United are very keen to add him to their ranks to increase their proficiency in front of goal.</p>
