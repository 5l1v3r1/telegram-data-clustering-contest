      <p>Former Presidential Staffer Stanislav X. Dogbe has taken a swipe at President Akufo-Addo for saying this year’s Damba festival is the first one in over 30 years break.</p>
      <p>MyNewsGH.com readers will recall President Akufo-Addo posted on Saturday, 16th November, 2019, that he attended the Damba Festival in Yendi and that it was “the first time it has been held in over thirty (30) years.”</p>
      <p>“Saturday’s festival is proof that the peace of Dagbon is holding, and we can begin to point to concrete signs of the peace dividend. The young people of Yendi, who have known nothing but strife, now can see another and more attractive side of their heritage. The Damba festival is no longer a tale of bygone years told by nostalgic old men and women; it is a real and living part of Dagbon life.” He added.</p>
      <p>Reacting to the development, Mr. Stan Dogbe said “it is becoming not only embarrassing but outright unacceptable, the deliberate lies our President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo continues to spew out, without shame.”</p>
      <p>According to him, even the Prime minister of Barbados who was in attendance will be shocked because she would have been briefed about the festival.</p>
      <p>“I am sure that even the Prime Minister of Barbados, whose team would have prepared a brief on the festival for her, will be wondering what her host was talking about.” Stan Dogbe wrote.</p>
      <p>“How do you gleefully look into the face of the Yaa Naa and other chiefs, and also the people of Dagbon and tell them that yesterday/ this year was/is the first time in 30 years that the people were celebrating Damba festival?” He asked.</p>
      <p>He urged Ghanaians not to entertain “presidential lies”.</p>
      <p>“As a people we should not entertain such presidential lies and the deliberate distortion of history.</p>
      <p>We are in this country, and at least I was present at a number of Damba festivals in the last few years.  Why the lies?”</p>
