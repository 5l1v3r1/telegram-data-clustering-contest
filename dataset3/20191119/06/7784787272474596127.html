      <h1>Carlton co-captain Sam Docherty believes he can recapture his All-Australian form when he returns next season</h1>

      <h3>Sam Docherty hasn’t played a game since he was named All-Australian for the first time in 2017 or featured once since he was named Carlton co-captain with Patrick Cripps.</h3>
      <p>But after more than two years on the sidelines, the star half-back is confident he can return to the form that made him one of the more damaging rebounding defenders in the game.</p>
      <p>This time last year, the 26-year-old was on track to return from a knee reconstruction before disaster struck at Princes Park in early December when he ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament for the second time in 12 months.</p>

      <p>Docherty recently returned from a week-long training block with world renowned reconditioning expert Bill Knowles in Philadelphia – who worked with Essendon star Devon Smith and GWS co-captain Callan Ward the week before he arrived – and started day one of the pre-season on Monday.</p>
      <p>The former Brisbane Lions defender is currently completing 80 per cent of the training program and is aiming to join in full contact training by the middle of January, ahead of a return in the pre-season competition.</p>
      <p>“My body is really good. I said I wasn’t going to come back and train last week, and inevitably when I came back from the States I went in and trained last Friday and Wednesday. It is feeling pretty good,” Docherty said at a press conference in Brunswick East on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
      <p>“I’m probably one of the only blokes in the AFL at the moment who is pretty excited about a long pre-season. I haven’t had much training for two full years, so I’m chomping at the bit to come out.</p>
      <p>“I had a really good week in Philadelphia before I came back and I’m fit and firing and training well.</p>
      <p>“I’d be mad if I wasn’t to say I’m trying to get back to the form I left in. inevitably I’m going to come back a better athlete, fitter, stronger than I was when I was playing. Fingers crossed I haven’t lost my footy IQ and I should be OK.”</p>

      <p>With Carlton’s first to fourth-year players reporting back for pre-season earlier this month, Docherty jetted off to the United States for a hit and run mission with one of Carlton’s physios.</p>
      <p>Docherty returned from a brutal week under the watch of Knowles, who has worked with Tiger Woods, Alex Rodriguez, Peyton Manning, Jonny Wilkinson and Frank Lampard during his 30-year career, armed with a new program to implement inside Carlton’s headquarters this summer.</p>
      <p>“(The program involved) a bit of different stuff. A lot of it I’d done but the way he teaches you and his methodology; he is really good at breaking everything down to change of direction which inevitably is what you need to do when you hurt your knee,” he said.</p>
      <p>“His progressions from basic exercises through to actually out on the track where all built together. That was really motivating.</p>
      <p>“I took one of our physios over and he has brought a lot of that stuff back and will wedge that in to my program when I’ve got spare time.”</p>
      <p>Plenty has changed since the last time Docherty played a game. Brendon Bolton was the coach. Marc Murphy was the captain. Bryce Gibbs was still at the club. And the Blues were still sponsored by Nike.</p>
      <p>Now Docherty wants to get back to doing what he does best.</p>
