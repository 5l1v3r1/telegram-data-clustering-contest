      <p>TOKYO, Nov 19 — Toyota Motor Corp today said Japanese labour officials have found it responsible for the suicide of an employee, with the <i>Mainichi Shimbun</i> reporting that workplace bullying at the automaker had led to the employee’s death.</p>
      <p>The news comes as a shrinking workforce and changing values about work-life balance in Japan have meant companies are increasingly found responsible for workplace-related suicide.</p>
      <p>Toyota City’s labour standards officials had been investigating the 2017 suicide of a Toyota Motor employee, a spokesman at the automaker confirmed to Reuters.</p>
      <p>“It’s true that the labour authority determined it was a workplace injury, but we cannot comment further as discussions between representatives are ongoing,” the spokesman said.</p>
      <p>Daily newspaper <i>Mainichi Shimbun</i>, which was the first to report the officials’ conclusion, said that the employee’s supervisor had called him an “idiot” said he was “better dead”.</p>
      <p>The worker committed suicide in a company dormitory at the age of 28, the newspaper reported. The worker’s family plans to sue the automaker, the newspaper said.</p>
      <p>Labour officials declined to confirm their decision to Reuters, saying they could not comment on individual cases.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been pushing to improve workplace practices in favour of workers’ rights, with issues such as parental leave increasingly in the spotlight. — Reuters</p>
