      <p>Amid sloganeering by Congress over various issues in Lok Sabha, Speaker <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/om-birla">Om Birla </a>on Tuesday warned that he will be forced to take action against members protesting in the Well.</p>
      <p>As soon as the House met for the day, Congress and other Opposition parties, including DMK and TMC, wanted to raise certain issues.</p>
      <p>With the Speaker taking up the Question Hour, more than 20 members from the Congress trooped into the Well and began shouting slogans against the central government.</p>
      <p>Birla repeatedly requested the protesting members to go back to their seats as the questions were about farmers' issues.</p>
      <p>As the protests continued, a visibly peeved Birla warned that action would be taken against members.</p>
      <p>"There might have been precedents of protesting in the Well. From today onwards, no (member) will protest in the Well. If not, I will be forced to take action," he said.</p>
      <p>Amid the din, various questions and supplementaries related to farmers' issues were taken up.</p>
      <p>At one point of time, the Speaker also said that he would give a chance for protesting members to ask supplementaries if they go back to their respective seats.</p>
      <p>However, the members continued with their protests.</p>
      <p>Congress members sought to raise various issues, including the withdrawal of SPG security cover of party president Sonia Gandhi, her son Rahul Gandhi and her daughter Priyanka Gandhi Vadra.</p>
      <p>Apart from the Congress, members from the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/politics-news-national-1550101.htm">National </a>Conference were also in the Well.</p>
