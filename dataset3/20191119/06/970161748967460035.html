      <p>The first season of Amazon Prime’s Lord Of The Rings television series hasn’t even begun shooting yet, but it’s already been renewed for a second season.</p>
      <p>The streaming service confirmed to <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/the-lord-of-the-rings-series-renewed-season-2-amazon-early-renewal-season-1-hiatus-writers-room-reassembled-1202788730/">Deadline</a> that the sequel is in the works and that the hotly-anticipated show will go on a hiatus for around four months after filming the first two season one episodes, which will be directed by J.A. Bayona.</p>
      <p>During that break, the writing team, led by showrunners and executive producers J.D. Payne and Patrick McKay, will map out the scripts for the following chapter.</p>
      <p>According to Amazon Studios boss Jennifer Salke, production will kick off next year, however, with the epic scale of the drama, we might be waiting a while for it to land on our screens.</p>
      <p>With many details remaining firmly under wraps and<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/22/amazons-lord-rings-tv-series-cast-game-thrones-star-joseph-mawle-villain-10959629/"> only a handful of casting announcements revealed</a> so far, fans were over the moon about the renewal and shared their excitement on Twitter, with one writing: ‘That’s what I’m Tolkien about.’</p>

      <p>The Lord Of The Rings TV show will follow a different story to the famous films by Peter Jackson and Amazon revealed the prequel is set in the Second Age of Middle-Earth.</p>
      <p>Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey confirmed that the streaming giant will have to stay true to Tolkien’s written history of Middle Earth and absolutely not stray into either the First or Third Age of the world from the author’s novels.</p>

      <p>Confirming his involvement earlier this year, Bayona said: ‘JRR Tolkien created one of the most extraordinary and inspiring stories of all time, and as a lifelong fan it is an honour and a joy to join this amazing team.</p>
      <p>‘I can’t wait to take audiences around the world to Middle-Earth and have them discover the wonders of the Second Age, with a never before seen story.’</p>
      <p>Game Of Thrones star <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/22/amazons-lord-rings-tv-series-cast-game-thrones-star-joseph-mawle-villain-10959629/">Joseph Mawle has been cast as the show’s villain</a>, while Years &amp; Years star Maxim Baldry will be playing a ‘significant role’ according to reports.</p>
      <p>The Revenant actor Will Poulter has also bagged a lead part in the production too, however details of his role have not been revealed.</p>
      <p>It was recently <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/05/scotland-wont-get-lord-of-the-rings-shoot-because-of-brexit-10118731/">announced filming will take place in New Zealand</a>, the home of Peter Jackson’s original Lord Of The Rings trilogy and the subsequent Hobbit movies.</p>
