      <p>Donegal boss Declan Bonner says he expects to have news on Odhran MacNiallais’s potential return in the next 10 days. <br/><br/>MacNiallais opted against rejoining the county panel following his club Gaoth Dobhair’s run to the All-Ireland club semi-final last February, saying “I just have no real interest in football at the minute”. <br/><br/>However, a county final defeat to Naomh Conaill last month, albeit after a second replay, has afforded the towering midfielder some breathing space this winter and Bonner has been in touch with him of late. <br/><br/>In his absence, Donegal retained their Ulster title this year but failed to progress to the All-Ireland semi-finals for the second successive season. <br/><br/>“I have had a number of discussions,” said Bonner, speaking at the launch of the new Donegal jersey. “Nothing has been finalised. It will probably be a week to 10 days before we get closure on that.” <br/><br/>Bonner said he expects to have up to a dozen new players coming into the panel, with 2012 All-Ireland winner Frank McGlynn the only retiree so far.</p>

      <p>“Frank is a loss. There is no doubt about that with the experience he brings to the set-up. <br/><br/>“He is a loss but Frank has come to a stage where he knows the body is not going to take it. <br/><br/>“It is a serious commitment now but there will be up to 10 or 12 new faces coming in.” <br/><br/>This time last year teams were preparing for a new set of experimental rules which were trialled in the pre-season competitions and Allianz League and, arising from that, three of them have been adopted permanently. <br/><br/>They are the inside mark, sin bin and kickouts being taken from the 20-metre line though Bonner is not a fan of the tinkering. <br/><br/>“I felt the Championship throughout the year had some brilliant games, our game against Kerry and the draw and replayed finals, and I saw no reason to change. <br/><br/>“You can see the game moving away from blanket defences because the top teams know the only way to succeed is with an expansive, offensive type of game-plan and it is making for some great games.” <br/><br/>The advanced mark is likely to be the most influential of the three new rules and Bonner added: “It is up to the referee in that split second the mark is called, do you take it, how do you acknowledge it? <br/><br/>“Some people are saying it could slow up the game but it is there now and we will be no different to anyone else in that we will be working on it.”</p>
