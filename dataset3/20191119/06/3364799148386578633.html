      <p>The trade war is taking a massive toll - earlier this week, <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/global-trade-stalls-as-trumps-tariff-fights-bite-wto-warns-2019-11-1028697292?utm_source=msn.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=msn-slideshow&amp;utm_campaign=bodyurl">the World Trade Organization warned that global trade was stalling</a> because of it.</p>
      <p>Goldman Sachs economists said the trade war was hitting China the hardest - mainly because of the drop in net trade.</p>
      <p>The bank does expect an "extended truce" and sees the drag on growth waning next year, "assuming that tariffs stay at current levels through 2020."</p>
      <p>Still, the impact has been clear. Below are four charts showing the extent of the damage.</p>

      <h3>US financial conditions have tightened.</h3>

      <p>Through Goldman's index on financial conditions, the data shows that conditions worsened through the trade war, with the divergence starting to widen around March 2018. Right now it looks as if it's only getting larger.</p>

      <h3>People in China are getting worried.</h3>

      <p>Baidu, the Chinese internet and artificial-intelligence company, which also functions as a search engine, is a good measure for uncertainty, according to Goldman. As shown, there have been major spikes at crucial points in the trade war.</p>
      <hr/>

      <h3>China has been worse off in terms of the hit on GDP, but only just.</h3>
      <figure>

      <p>While the US benefitted in terms of net trade, both sides suffered in terms of real income, financial conditions, and trade-policy uncertainty. Ultimately it's knocked off roughly 0.5% of US gross domestic product and 0.7% of China's - China's GDP growth earlier this year slowed to its lowest level since the '90s.</p>

      <h3>The trade war is expected to keep dragging into the new decade.</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>For both sides, the trade war is expected to be a substantial drag on GDP into 2020. China isn't projected to recover until the second half of next year, and the US nearer to 2021.</p>
