      <h1>Teenager's family speak of 'heart-breaking' time in court as he is cleared of one punch incident</h1>
      <h2>Dylan Marriott says he was acting in self defence</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T06:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Rod Malcolm</a></address>
      <p>A teenager's family spoke with joy as he was cleared of GBH when facing a man who threatened to stab him.</p>
      <p>Mum Danielle Marriott saw 19-year-old Dylan walk free from <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/courts">court</a> and told his barrister: "You have given me my boy back."</p>
      <p>Relatives and friends spent a week in Nottingham Crown Court listening to evidence and legal debate about the clash in Long Row on February 23.</p>
      <p>Mr Marriott told how he went up to help a man, who was clearly drunk. He was faced with threats and abusive remarks.</p>
      <p>As the man leaned back as if to strike, Mr Marriott punched him once and saw him fall to the ground. The man suffered head injuries.</p>
      <p>Outside court, Mr Marriott said: "It was self-defence. He went down.</p>
      <p>"I only went up to him because I was trying to help," said Mr Marriott, of Vernon Park Drive, Basford.</p>
      <p>Mother-of four Mrs Marriott, 38, said: "We have been here every day and it has been heart-breaking.</p>
      <p>"The other guy had a knife. Police found it on him later.</p>
      <p>"Since this happened, it has been a very emotional time, a rollercoaster. I have never been in this position before and it has been terrible.</p>
      <p>"It was a one punch incident, that's what people say."</p>
      <p>Mr Marriott denied causing grievous bodily harm and was defended by barrister Sarah Phelan.</p>
      <p>He was cleared by a jury which began its deliberations on Friday.</p>
      <p>On Monday it delivered a "not guilty" verdict on a charge of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm.</p>
      <p>The injured man was put into an induced coma at the Queen's Medical Centre. He has now been released.</p>
      <p>Mr Marriott's 22-year-old sister Amy said: "He's the glue that holds us together. He's a lovely boy. He would do anything for anybody."</p>
      <p>Mrs Marriott first heard of the incident when her son was working in Lincolnshire the next day. He discovered that police wanted to interview him.</p>
      <p>He returned immediately, spoke to police officers and handed over the clothing he was wearing that night to help their enquiries.</p>
      <p>Mrs Marriott went on: "Dylan rang to say 'police are looking for me.' He said he wanted to help them.</p>
      <p>"They didn't even need to cuff him in custody.</p>
      <p>"But it has been so hard on us. It is out of your control, thinking of your child being punished by someone else."</p>
      <p>After the jury returned its verdict, Recorder Jennifer Jones thanked them for their work.</p>
      <p>She then told Mr Marriott: "You are free to leave the dock and free to leave court thereafter."</p>
