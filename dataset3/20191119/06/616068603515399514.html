      <p>Pamela Anderson has been forced to cancel a prison visit to Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, due to a personal emergency.<br/><br/>The actress was scheduled to visit Assange in Belmarsh Prison in London on Tuesday, ahead of a press conference, but her plans have changed.<br/><br/>A spokesman for the Don't Extradite Assange campaign said, "Pamela has a personal emergency which has meant she has had to go home and cancel everything for the next two weeks."<br/><br/>Anderson visited Assange earlier this year and recently told TV show The Talk she was "extremely distressed at the thought of his declining state."<br/><br/>Prior to his arrest and detention, Assange spent seven years in exile at the Ecuadorean Embassy in London to avoid extradition.<br/><br/>He faces 18 charges in the U.S., including allegations he conspired to break into a Pentagon computer and leaked hundreds of thousands of classified documents.</p>
