      <p>The Kansas City Chiefs defeated the Los Angeles Chargers 24-17 as the NFL returned to Mexico City.</p>
      <p>Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes had a career-high 59 rushing yards but was limited to 182 passing and threw just one touchdown, to Travis Kelce, in a hard-fought victory.</p>
      <p>LeSean McCoy and Darrel Williams claimed rushing scores for the Chiefs’ other touchdowns.</p>

      <p>Kansas City lost wide receiver Tyreek Hill and starting running back Damien Williams to injuries but Daniel Sorensen’s end zone interception of a pass by Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers with 18 seconds left on the clock meant the Chiefs held on for the win.</p>
      <p>The result sees the Chiefs (7-4) cement their position on top of the AFC West table with the Chargers, whose touchdown came from Keenan Allen, on 4-7 and stuck in third place in the same division.</p>
      <p>The clash at the Azteca Stadium was the 10th NFL game staged in Mexico City, and first since 2017.</p>
