        <b>Alex Neil has highlighted the importance of training sessions for the players on the fringes of the Preston squad to catch his eye.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The depth of the PNE squad is such that some players are struggling to get a place on the bench, let alone a start.</p>
      <p>With a relatively short injury list compared to the last couple of seasons, the competition for places is fierce.</p>
      <p>Neil points out though, that players have come into the team at times this season after seemingly being quite a way out of the picture.</p>
      <p>“When you are not in the team your training that week is even more important,” said Lilywhites boss Neil.</p>
      <p>“That is their opportunity to impress me and show everybody else why you should be playing.</p>
      <p>“The difficulty they have got at the moment is how well the team has been playing and performing.</p>
      <p>“It has been really difficult for some of the lads to get in.</p>
      <p>“We could go right across the board with that but things do change.</p>
      <p>“Joe Rafferty couldn’t get in at the start of the season and he hasn’t looked back.</p>
      <p>“Josh Harrop wasn’t in the squads at the start of the season and didn’t really look back until he got an injury.</p>
      <p>“Jayden Stockley and Louis Moult weren’t in. There’s a whole host of them there.”</p>
      <p>Big-money buy Tom Bayliss, loan signing Andre Green, Josh Ginnelly, Paul Huntington and Jordan Storey have yet to start a league game for PNE this season.</p>
      <p>Neil keeps players sharp by organising bounce games.</p>
      <p>Last week, North End were due to play Barrow in the Lancashire Senior Cup at Springfields which would have provided much-needed game time.</p>
      <p>But the Cumbrian side were forced to forfeit the tie as they could not raise a team.</p>
      <p>Green, on loan from Aston Villa, is currently nursing a toe injury.</p>
      <p>It has been a problem which has flared up recently, his lack of game time before that due to others being ahead of him in the pecking order.</p>
      <p>Said Neil: “Andre is in a position which a lot of the other lads who are not really featuring, are in.</p>
      <p>“Who do you take out of the team to put him in?</p>
      <p>“At the moment Andre has got a problem with his big toe.</p>
      <p>“He’s got arthritis which means he’d had a few injections in it, so at the moment he’s not currently fit.</p>
      <p>“However, that’s only been for the last couple of weeks.”</p>
      <p>Green, 21, has come on as a substitute four times in the Championship.</p>
      <p>He last appeared as a late sub in the 1-1 draw with Leeds on October 23.</p>
      <p>The winger started twice in the League Cup, scoring in the 4-0 win over Bradford.</p>
