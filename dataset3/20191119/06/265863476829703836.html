      <h1>KUWK: Kourtney Kardashian Responds To People Outraged She Supposedly Banned Candy At Her Kids’ Candy-Land Themed Party!</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T06:27:19+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 06:27</time> by <a rel="author">Nick Markus</a></address>
      <p>Kourtney Kardashian is always so passionate about healthy eating that people think she doesn’t let her three kids enjoy any type of candy ever! That being said, social media users did not hesitate to slam the reality TV star for this.</p>
      <p>Their collective outrage comes after an episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians in which it looks like Kourt wanted to simply ban sweets at her daughter Penelope and sister Kim’s daughter North’s joint Candy Land-themed birthday party!</p>
      <p>However, it turns out that it was just a misunderstanding as Kourtney insists she simply wanted ‘healthier options’ and not to just get rid of all candy from the, ironically enough, ’Candy-Land’ themed bash.</p>
      <p>That being said, after the episode aired yesterday and people online started to slam the mother of three, she took to Twitter to make it very clear that she is not the type of person they make her out to be.</p>
      <p>In other words, Kourtney may be a lifestyle and wellness blogger, which naturally means that she is passionate about what she and her family members consume, but she never bans her kids from eating any fun foods at all!</p>
      <p>In response to a user that told her on the platform: ‘You can’t have a candyland themed party without candy….smh. #KUWTK,’ Kourtney was quick to respond: ‘I never said NO candy. I just said not all junk food, let’s have some salads and @KimKardashian said that she wanted the ice cream truck and so I suggested organic ice cream with some non-dairy options. Moderation.’</p>
      <p>But that was not the end of it because before she could’ve given this explanation, another person expressed how shocked they were about the ‘no sweets’ party and said they hoped she leaves KUWK!</p>
      <p>Kourtney did not hesitate to respond to them as well, writing: ‘Thanks for being this invested in this sugar plum. I did not say No sweets, we had organic cotton candy, and more. There’re healthier candy options. I appreciate your concern about my future as well, may God bless your sweet soul. #KUWTK.’</p>
