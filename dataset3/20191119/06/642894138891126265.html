      <p>JMR Software Pty Ltd (JMR)is proud to have been nominated, along with Wesleyan and Sapiens, as a finalist for the UK IT Industry Awards for ‘IT Project Team of the Year'.</p>
      <p>The awards dinner took place at the Battersea Park Events Arena, situated in London, on Wednesday, 13 November 2019.</p>
      <p>The IT Industry Awards aims to set the performance benchmark in IT and recognise exceptional people, projects and technological innovation. This particular award is presented to project teams that have achieved exceptional results through an outstanding project implementation and, in so doing, demonstrated high levels of professionalism in IT.</p>
      <p>JMR’s shortlisting was based on its work migrating the mutual society complex policy structure from eight books of business and five legacy systems to a single, new Sapiens ConsolidationMaster platform.</p>
      <p>Barry MacDougall, Service Delivery Director for JMR Software, said: “We have been working with Wesleyan Assurance for a number of years and have an excellent and strong working relationship. This nomination again demonstrates great confidence in our comprehensive data migration service and how we have developed as a team.”</p>
      <p>Wesleyan Assurance has benefited from over 30 years’ experience of successfully delivering data migration projects with a 100% success rate. The data migration projects have been delivered using JMR BITSHIFT, a Data Migration as a Service solution that combines a robust and unique approach designed to mitigate business risk while allowing maximum flexibility around day-to-day operations.</p>
      <p>The JMR, Sapiens and Wesleyan team were competing with substantial companies such as Accenture Solutions Pvt in partnership with BT, CANCOM, Centrica, UK Power Networks, University of Derby, Virgin Trains (West Coast Trains) and several others, but Virgin Trains shone through to win the award.</p>
