      <h1>Bank Indonesia to pause to assess impact of previous easing – TD Securities</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T06:48:56+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 06:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/dhwani-mehta" target="_blank">Dhwani Mehta</a></address>
      <p>Analysts at TD Securities offer a detailed preview of what to expect from Bank Indonesia’s (BI) monetary policy decision due to be announced this Thursday.</p>
      <h3>Key Quotes:</h3>
      <p>“We expect Bank Indonesia to keep policy on hold at its meeting on Thursday 21st November, with the 7-day Reverse Repo likely to be kept on hold at 5.0% following a "pre-emptive" easing at the last meeting in October.</p>
      <p>However, we expect BI to maintain an accommodative stance, highlighting that this is a pause after a total of 100bp of cuts, rather than a halt to easing.</p>
      <p>Pressure on the economy has continued to remain in place, with Indonesia's <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar">manufacturing PMI</a> moving further into contraction territory in October, while consumer confidence declined.</p>
      <p>Inflation has remained well behaved, with both headline and core measures falling in October, the former to a lower than expected reading of 3.13% y/y and the latter to 3.20% y/y, below the mid point of Bank Indonesia's 3.5% +/- 1% target band.</p>
      <p>We expect a gradual uptick in inflation in the months ahead, but not to a degree that should prevent further easing in Q1. A relatively stable IDR will also likely give confidence for BI to lower rates further.</p>
      <p>We expect two more rate cuts in this cycle but think BI will slow the pace of rate cuts, with the 7 day reverse repo likely to fall to 4.5% by end Q1 2020.”</p>
