      <h1>When you have a surname like this AFL draft prospect does, a cheeky Simpsons reference is inevitable</h1>

      <h3>Sam Flanders has heard them all before.</h3>
      <p>‘Rod’, ‘Todd’, ‘Maude’ and, most commonly, ‘Ned’ – they all fail to pique the top-10 AFL draft prospect’s interest whenever he’s informally addressed as a Flanders character from <i>The Simpsons</i>.</p>
      <p>And even though his life’s about to change forever, he realises the jokes won’t stop when he lands at an AFL club.</p>

      <p>“The obvious one is Ned – pretty funny, right? Pretty original,” Flanders tells <i>foxfooty.com.au</i> with a half-smile, knowing the inevitable question had just been asked.</p>
      <p>“Luckily I haven’t heard it too often. But if I’m fortunate enough to make it onto an AFL list, I guarantee you I’ll be hearing it.</p>
      <p>“I better get used to it again.”</p>

      <p>The ‘Ned’ nickname is perhaps the only aspect of Flanders’ footy journey that has remained stable over the past 12 months, as 2019 has been a significant period of change for the Gippsland Power prospect.</p>
      <p>Flanders has experienced new coaches, a new lifestyle and, most significantly regarding his draft prospects, a new position on the footy field.</p>
      <p>The 18-year-old burst onto the scene in 2018 as an explosive small forward, impressing on-lookers as a bottom-ager for Vic Country with his athleticism and goal sense.</p>
      <p>But as this season has progressed, Flanders has gradually spent more time as an on-baller – and, gradually, the big games have come, with none bigger than his four-goal, 27-disposal effort for Gippsland against Oakleigh in a qualifying final.</p>
      <p>Overall, Flanders increased his NAB League disposal average from 16.0 in 2018 to 22.4 on his way to winning Gippsland’s best and fairest award. Importantly, he still managed to kick more than one goal per match.</p>
      <p>And at the national carnival, he averaged 23 disposals and five clearances per game for Vic Country to earn All-Australian selection.</p>

      <p>Flanders says the midfield role “started to click” for him during the back-half of the national carnival. And after learning handy running patterns, playing on the ball became a “more natural” task.</p>
      <p>“There were easy parts and there were challenging parts to the position switch,” Flanders says.</p>
      <p>“The easy part was around the IQ for the game because it’s sort of similar in terms of ‘see ball, get ball’. But the challenges were the running, because it’s a whole different type of running. As a forward you have a couple of short bursts before you break, but in the midfield you’re consistently running at the same pace – and that’s just something you’ve got to get used to.”</p>
      <p>Flanders’ ability on the footy field has taken him to many cities around Australia to represent his state. But he never forgets his country roots.</p>
      <p>Flanders grew up on his family’s dairy farm in Fish Creek – a small town in South Gippsland around 170km south-east of Melbourne. He claims there was “nothing better than going down and watching the local team Fish Creek” as a youngster.</p>
      <p>Seeking greater sporting opportunities, Flanders moved in with family friends in Warragul to attend Lowanna College. He’s remained in Warragul since, but Fish Creek will always be home.</p>
      <p>“You’ve got to remember where you come from,” he says.</p>

      <p>“I get messages all the time from people back at Fish Creek, saying ‘congratulations’ and ‘good luck’. You can’t forget the support they’ve given you along the way.</p>
      <p>“Without them, I wouldn’t be where I am now.”</p>
      <p>For most of Flanders’ childhood, though, playing in the AFL wasn’t his dream. A promising basketballer that represented Victoria at Under 16 level and helped his school win an Under 17 3x3 state title, he had ambitions to play in the NBA.</p>
      <p>There was just one problem: “I didn’t grow past six foot, so those dreams were crushed pretty quickly.”</p>
      <p>So suddenly, footy went from a social hobby to a “more realistic” career choice. And after coming to grips with his decision to leave basketball behind, Flanders thrived, to the point where he’s now pushed himself into top-10 — perhaps top-six — draft contention.</p>
      <p>“I was playing so much basketball, so when I switched back to football, it was almost like a refresher because I rediscovered the love and passion for the game,” he says.</p>

      <p>Flanders has been linked to both Sydney (Pick 5) and Adelaide, which now holds Pick 6 in the draft after swapping selections with the Giants on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The thought of moving interstate doesn’t faze Flanders, as whichever club he’s drafted by will be a long way from Warragul and Fish Creek.</p>
      <p>“You put in so much hard work, long days in the sun over the off-season. For it all to hopefully pay off, it’s going to be a big weight off the shoulder,” he says.</p>
      <p>“But I know the hard work doesn’t stop there. Like anything, it’ll probably get harder.”</p>
