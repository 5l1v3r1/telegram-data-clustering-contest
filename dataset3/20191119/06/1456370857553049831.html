      <h1>Knowing What Happens Next, T-Mobile CEO Legere Heads For The Exit</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T06:18:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 06:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.techdirt.com/user/kbode" target="_blank">Karl Bode</a></address>
      <p>We've long noted that T-Mobile's brand reputation as a feisty consumer-friendly disruptor is only really skin deep. While the T-Mobile of 2012 or so certainly added some much needed competition to the wireless sector (killing ETFs, eliminating long-term contracts, and eroding international roaming costs), more recently the company has started to look a lot like the bigger competitors (AT&amp;T, Verizon) it pretends to be superior to. From <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160107/14412033273/t-mobiles-john-legere-goes-off-deep-end-who-fuck-are-you-eff.shtml">mocking groups like the EFF</a> to <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20161206/05394636203/t-mobile-applauds-likely-death-net-neutrality-under-trump.shtml">opposing net neutrality</a>, the company isn't all <b>that</b> different from the companies its brash CEO John Legere likes to make fun of.</p>
      <p>The disconnect between the T-Mobile consumer friendly "uncarrier" brand and reality has proven particularly notable as T-Mobile and Sprint have kissed up to the Trump administration to gain regulatory approval for their controversial $26 billion megamerger.</p>
      <p>From hiring Trump campaign manager Cory Lewandowski days after he <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40588026/t-mobile-should-speak-out-about-corey-lewandowski-and-fire-him">mocked a kid with Down Syndrome on TV</a>, to trampling the Constitution's emoluments clause by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sprint-corp-m-a-trump/t-mobile-spent-195000-at-trump-hotel-in-d-c-since-merger-announcement-idUSKCN1QM1ZY">ramping up patronage of Trump's DC hotel</a> to get merger approval, it hasn't been a pretty sight. Not a week goes by where Legere, who spent years mocking other companies' "bullshit," can't be found making <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190218/09074141624/sprint-t-mobile-execs-continue-to-hallucinate-competitors-their-post-merger-dreamscape.shtml">false promises</a> related to the megadeal.</p>
      <p>While the deal has unsurprisingly received the DOJ (now run by former Verizon lawyer Bill Barr) and FCC (now run by former Verizon lawyer Ajit Pai) blessing thanks to T-Mobile's relentless ass kissing, it still faces a looming lawsuit by a <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20190805/07480342722/texas-ag-joins-lawsuit-against-t-mobile-showing-bipartisan-opposition-to-mindless-mas.shtml">bipartisan coalition of 13 state AGs</a>. Which makes it an interesting time for T-Mobile CEO John Legere to announce he'll be leaving the company <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/43k973/t-mobiles-john-legere-was-never-a-cool-ceo">starting next May</a> to be replaced by current T-Mobile COO Mike Sievert. Legere likely realizes it's best to go out on top. He also likely realizes that he probably shouldn't stick around to watch his company <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/43k973/t-mobiles-john-legere-was-never-a-cool-ceo">slowly become everything he claims to despise</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>"Modern T-Mobile was born from the remnants of the DOJ’s decision to block AT&amp;T from buying T-Mobile in 2011. The blocking of the deal forced AT&amp;T to pay a $4 billion break up fee, money then used to propel T-Mobile to success. <br/><br/>Ironically, a company born out of government opposition to wireless consolidation is now pushing for one of the most controversial megadeals in industry history. The shift, driven largely by T-Mobile majority owner Deutsche Telekom, forced Legere into a role that’s in stark contrast to the brash, consumer-friendly persona he’d built since 2012."</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>If you've listened to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/10/20908539/t-mobile-sprint-merger-dish-network-failure-stopped-antitrust-experts-doj">economists</a>, consumer groups, or 40 years of telecom history, it's clear that eliminating just one of four wireless competitors is going to hurt competition, raise rates, and result in endless layoffs as duplicative positions are inevitably eliminated. Since Legere has been busy promising the <i>exact opposite of that</i>, it's probably a good time to get while the getting's good, before his entire branding persona--replete with cookbooks and magenta high tops--is exposed as superficial by the company's inevitable thirst to take advantage of less competition than ever.</p>
