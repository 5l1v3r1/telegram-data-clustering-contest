      <p><i>The Late Show with Stephen Colbert </i>continued its ongoing chronicling of the Trump impeachment inquiry on Monday night, ensuring the aliens who discover Earth's wreckage in a million years will know how we destroyed ourselves.</p>
      <p>In particular, Colbert focused on the upcoming testimony of U.S. ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, whose phone call with President Trump regarding the potential quid pro quo with Ukraine has already been the subject of damning testimonies.Â </p>
      <p>According to witnesses, Trump made it explicit in the conversation that he was aiming for Ukraine to open up an investigation into the Bidens. And this wasn't the only flavor of disturbing in the call.</p>
      <p>"[Counselor David] Holmes confirmed that he did indeed overhear Sondland's phone call, and added this colorful detail: in the call he heard Sondland tell Trump, 'President Zelensky 'loves your ass,''" said Colbert, before showing a photograph of Trump's rump in a remarkable disservice to his audience.</p>
      <p>"Mm-mmm! Yeah! That's like two hams stuffed in a surgical glove, or a plastic tablecloth full of rice pudding, or like two loaves of Poppin' Fresh microwaved in a christening gown."</p>
