      <h1>Burger King Sued for Meat-Contaminated Impossible Whoppers</h1>
      <h2>Plant-based with a hint of meat byproduct.</h2>

      <p>A vegan customer recently accused <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/burger-king">Burger King</a> of cooking its meatless <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/impossible-burger">Impossible Burgers</a> on the same grill as its meat burgers, thus contaminating them. Phillip Williams claims an Impossible Whopper he ordered at an Atlanta drive-through was “coated in meat by-products” and is seeking damages for all US purchasers of the Impossible Whopper.</p>
      <p>The lawsuit states Burger King should “plainly disclose” that the two styles of burgers are cooked together. However, Burger King’s website notes that “for guests looking for a meat-free option, a non-broiler method of preparation is available upon request.” Similarly, <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/impossible-foods">Impossible Foods</a>‘ head of sales Dana Worth recently stated that “for people who are strictly vegan, there is a microwave prep procedure that they’re welcome to ask for in any store,” in regards to Impossible product consumption.</p>
      <p>Burger King began selling its Impossible Whopper back in August, so this offering is still relatively new for the fast-food chain. Stay tuned as the story develops.</p>
