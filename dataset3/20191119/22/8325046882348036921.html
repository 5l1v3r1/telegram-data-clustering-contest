        <li>You get a free seven-day trial when you first sign up.</li>
        <li>After the trial ends, <a href="http://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/196318/564546/9358?subId1=biip_111119_disney-plus-free-trial&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.disneyplus.com%2F">the subscription costs $6.99/month or $69.99/year ($5.83/month)</a>.</li>
        <li>The free trial does not apply to the $12.99 <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/disney-plus-bundle">Disney Plus bundle</a> that includes <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-get-hulu-for-free">Hulu</a> and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/30-for-30-documentaries-on-espn-plus">ESPN+</a>.</li>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/disney-plus">new Disney-centric streaming service, Disney Plus</a> launched on November 12, 2019.</p>
      <p>If you’re a fan of everything Disney – meaning Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, National Geographic, and 20th Century Fox – you’ve probably already signed up for the monthly or yearly subscription on the <a href="http://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/196318/564546/9358?subId1=biip_111119_disney-plus-free-trial&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.disneyplus.com%2F">Disney Plus</a> website.</p>
      <p>On the first day of launch, more than 10 million people subscribed to Disney Plus, and the numbers will only climb from here. Analysts are predicting that Disney Plus will have 18 million customers by the end of 2020.</p>
      <p>But if you’re just a casual Disney fan or you’re not sure whether you’ll like this new service, you don’t have to commit to a <a href="http://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/196318/564546/9358?subId1=biip_111119_disney-plus-free-trial&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.disneyplus.com%2F">subscription ($6.99/month or $69.99/year)</a> quite yet.</p>
      <h3>How to get a free trial on Disney Plus</h3>
      <p><a href="http://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/196318/564546/9358?subId1=biip_111119_disney-plus-free-trial&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.disneyplus.com%2F">Disney Plus</a> offers a free seven-day trial. This will give you the chance to browse and watch all of the movies and shows on the service. The free trial is only available to new subscribers.</p>
      <p>You can sign up via web browser, mobile device, Apple TV, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Samsung Smart TV, and Amazon Fire TV. When you sign up, you’re required to enter your payment information, which will be used to bill you at the end of the seven-day period.</p>
      <h3>What’s included in the Disney Plus free trial?</h3>
      <p>Everything a paying subscriber has access to. In addition to classic features such as the Disney and Pixar movies you grew up watching and new, recently released movies such as “Captain Marvel” and “Lion King,” Disney Plus has all-new, exclusive original programming. We recommend using the trial as an opportunity to see whether these original movies and shows are worth the monthly cost.</p>
      <h3>Is there a free trial for the Disney Plus bundle?</h3>
      <p>There’s also an option to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/disney-plus-bundle">buy a bundled package</a> with <a href="http://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/196318/564546/9358?subId1=biip_111119_disney-plus-free-trial&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.disneyplus.com%2F">Disney Plus</a>, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-get-hulu-for-free">Hulu</a>, and <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/30-for-30-documentaries-on-espn-plus">ESPN+</a>, which costs $12.99 per month for all three services. Individually, the ad-supported version of Hulu is currently $5.99 a month, and ESPN+ is $4.99 a month. If you haven’t explored the world of streaming services full yet, the bundle could be the perfect opportunity to do so for a competitive price. Signing up for all three of the services individually would cost $18. There’s also a way to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/disney-plus-bundle">get the bundle with the ad-free version of Hulu</a>.</p>
      <p>However, the caveat of signing up for either of these bundles is that you don’t get a free trial. Your paid subscription would start the first day you sign up.</p>
