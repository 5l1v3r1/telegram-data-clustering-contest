      <h1>GLAAD Commends Chick-fil-A for Dropping Donations to Christian Groups But Demands Franchise Change ‘Anti-LGBTQ’ Brand</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T22:05:31+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 22:05</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.nationalreview.com/" target="_blank">Mairead McArdle</a></address>
      <p>On Monday, the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation commended Chick-fil-A for its decision to halt donations to several Christian charities but demanded the fast-food chain do more to change its “anti-LGBTQ” brand.</p>
      <p>GLAAD said it “greet[s] today’s announcement with cautious optimism” but warned that the Georgia-based company still has work to do to fix its tarnished image with the LGBTQ community.</p>
      <p>“In addition to refraining from financially supporting anti-LGBTQ organizations, Chick-fil-A still lacks policies to ensure safe workplaces for LGBTQ employees and should unequivocally speak out against the anti-LGBTQ reputation that their brand represents,” GLAAD director of campaigns Drew Anderson <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/18/business/chick-fil-a-lgbtq-donations/index.html">said</a> in a statement to CNN.</p>
      <p>Chick-fil-A <a href="https://www.nationalreview.com/news/chick-fil-a-to-end-donations-to-christian-charities-after-lgbt-backlash/">announced</a> Monday that as the company expands it will no longer donate to the Salvation Army, the Paul Anderson Youth Home, and the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, which opposes same-sex marriage. The company’s charity, the Chick-fil-A Foundation, has donated millions of dollars to the two organizations.</p>
      <p>“We made multi-year commitments to both organizations and we fulfilled those obligations in 2018,” the company said, adding that from now on it will focus its charitable work “education, homelessness and hunger.”</p>
      <p>“There’s no question we know that, as we go into new markets, we need to be clear about who we are,” said Tim Tassopoulos, Chick-fil-A’s president and Chief Operating Officer. “There are lots of articles and newscasts about Chick-fil-A, and we thought we needed to be clear about our message.”</p>
      <p>Tassopoulos added that he believes the decision to pull donations will be “helpful” and is “just the right thing to do.”</p>
      <p>CEO Dan Cathy said in 2012 that Chick-fil-A backs “the biblical definition of the family unit.”</p>
      <p>Chick-fil-A has frequently found itself on the receiving end of criticism from LGBT rights advocates, with some groups <a href="https://www.thrillist.com/eat/chick-fil-a-nyc-locations-gay-rights-activists">boycotting</a> the franchise as it expanded.</p>
      <p>Conversely, however, Chick-fil-A’s move was excoriated by conservatives who accused the company of caving to progressive pressure at the expense of its charity work.</p>
      <p>“Congrats to the wokescolds who finally bullied Chick-Fil-A into stopping donations to the Salvation Army and their ‘bigoted’ history of helping the poor and helpless,” Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R., Texas) wrote in a tweet Tuesday. “Real big accomplishment for the progressives. Hope you’re happy.”</p>
