      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T22:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 22:00</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Spink, https://www.facebook.com/alexspinkmirror/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/joe-marler">Joe Marler</a> has dismissed <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/eddie-jones">Eddie Jones’</a> concerns that the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/saracens">Saracens</a> salary-cap scandal could fracture the national squad ahead of the Six Nations.</p>
      <p>The England forward says he does not expect team mates to fall out over it - nor for Sarries stars to prioritise the pressing needs of their club over those of the country.</p>
      <p>Jones voiced fears on Monday that there may be “some dislocation” between stars from an organisation found to have cheated the system for three seasons and the rest - describing it as a “reality”.</p>
      <p>Marler’s Harlequins club mates have been critical of Saracens, who have been slapped with a £5.36 million fine and 35-point deduction which leaves them 26 adrift of Premiership safety.</p>

      <p>But the prop disagreed with England coach Jones that the scandal would have a “significant impact” when the World Cup finalists reassemble.</p>
      <p>“There might be a little bit more banter,” said Marler. “I’ve teased the Saracens boys about it for the last few years!</p>

      <p>"Just as they’ve teased me about my s**t hair, how bad we’ve been here in the past, my breath, my wonky nose.</p>
      <p>“But you come in with the national side, put your club hat to one side and you all buy into what we’re about playing for England.</p>
      <p>"You can’t change the past. It’s been dealt with. I don’t think any bridges will need to be built there.”</p>
      <p>Marler, who indicated he will continue his Red Rose career, knows how big a call it is to make yourself unavailable to your country - having done so twice before.</p>
      <p>He said: “There is always that choice but I would be surprised if boys did choose to based on Sarries having a strong enough and big enough squad to cope anyway.”</p>
      <p>Quins boss Paul Gustard agreed, saying such a call would be tantamount to players choosing to retire from international rugby over “something that a club has done”.</p>
      <p>Saracens’ week went from bad to worse yesterday when they were fined an undisclosed amount for failing to attend the Champions Cup launch a fortnight ago.</p>
