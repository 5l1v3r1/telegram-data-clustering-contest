      <p><b>ORANGE, Mass.</b> - A man accused of killing a 26-year-old mother and then dumping her body near a wastewater treatment facility appeared in court for the first time.</p>
      <p>Keith Hamel, 23, of Athol, was arrested in the town's downtown area on Monday and then faced a judge in Orange on Tuesday, the same day of the funeral held for the victim, Kelsey Clifford.</p>
      <p>"We made a personal commitment to her family and her 4-year-old son Jaiden that we will be there moving forward and we made a commitment that he will know what a wonderful mother Kelsey was and share all the stories," said Brian Campbell, the victim's uncle.</p>
      <p>Clifford's family members, in court, were lashing out at him, calling Hamel an animal. His friends, however, defended his innocence.</p>
      <p>"Definitely go find the dude who did that," said Markus Luchock, one of Hamel's friends. "That's not Keith, he's not capable of this kind of thing."</p>
      <p>Prosecutors said Hamel was last seen with Clifford leaving her car at a Cumberland Farms in Athol just hours before her body was found at the wastewater plant. Court paperwork alleges Hamel beat and killed Clifford.</p>
      <p>A sweatshirt with her blood and his DNA was found between the plant and his house.</p>
      <p>According to her family, Clifford is a mother of a four-year-old and has been sorely missed by her loved ones.</p>
      <p>"She was very free-spirited," said Shiane Cordio, a friend of the victim. "I do not believe anytime they give either is justice enough, I want to look into his eyes and see if he has a soul because how can you do that to somebody? She just turned 26."</p>
      <p>Hamel sat in the prison holding area of the courtroom throughout the arraignment. He pleaded not guilty and is being held without bail.</p>
      <p>Very little details are being released on this case.</p>
