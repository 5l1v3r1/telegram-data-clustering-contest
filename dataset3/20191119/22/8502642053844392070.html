      <h1>Mapping Out the Near Completion of Soybean Harvest as Corn Continues</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T22:34:20+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 22:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.agriculture.com/author/emma-wilson" target="_blank">Emma Wilson</a></address>
      <p>With a drier week for much of the Corn Belt states, farmers were able to enjoy more favorable conditions for harvest.</p>
      <p>Nationally, corn harvest is 76% complete, significantly behind the five-year average at 92%.</p>
      <p>Soybean harvest progress is also slightly behind sitting at 91% harvested with the five-year average at 95% at this time. Northern Corn Belt states were hammered by early winter weather in late October, pushing farmers further behind on soybean harvest.</p>
      <h3>Iowa</h3>
      <p>Iowa soybean harvest is 95%, just slightly behind the five-year average at 98% at this week. However, last year at this time, 97% of Iowa soybean crops were out.</p>
      <p>Corn harvest is more dramatically behind at 77%, up from 64% at this time last week. However, significantly behind last year’s pace at 90% and the five-year average at 93%.</p>
      <p>Farmers in the center area of the state were hit with 2 inches of rain last week, keeping them out of the fields majority of the week. In other areas, precipitation totaled a half inch or less, causing short delays in harvest progress across the state.</p>

      <h3>Illinois</h3>
      <p>Much like Iowa, Illinois finished last week at 92% of soybeans harvested, behind the five-year average of 98%. At this time in 2018, 96% of Illinois soybeans were cut.</p>
      <p>At no surprise, corn harvested is also lagging behind at 80%. At this time last year, 99% of Illinois corn was harvested, above the five-year average at 97%.</p>
      <p>Southern Illinois farmers experienced a little over an inch of rainfall throughout the week last week. Other areas of the state experienced up to 0.5 inches and up to 0.6 inches in the northeastern counties of the state.</p>

      <h3>Nebraska</h3>
      <p>Soybean harvest in Nebraska has a more positive note, sitting right at the five-year average at 99%. At this time last year, only 97% of the crop was harvested. Farmers throughout the state will be finishing up with soybeans this week, allowing more focus on the corn crop.</p>
      <p>Corn harvest continues to lag behind in Nebraska at 85% this week, behind the five-year average at 91%.</p>
      <p>Farmers in Logan and the western half of Custer counties were hit with 1.5 inches last week, slowing harvest in their area. Northern parts of Nebraska received up to 0.5 inches while other areas saw little rainfall.</p>

      <h3>Minnesota</h3>
      <p>Minnesota farmers are slightly behind soybean harvest sitting at 97% with the five-year average right at 99%.</p>
      <p>Corn harvest is on track with other Midwestern states as they sit at 77%, up from 63% last week. The state also is considerably behind the five-year average of %94% at this time. In 2018, Minnesota had 92% of the corn crop harvested.</p>
      <p>The entire state experienced under an inch of precipitation last week, allowing for more harvesting days. Chisago, Isanti, Anoka, Wilkin and Otter Trail Counties had the most precipitation throughout the week with totals reaching 0.7 inches.</p>

      <h3>Indiana</h3>
      <p>Soybean harvest continues slightly behind at 91% with the five-year average at 95%. Last year at this time, soybean harvest reached 93%.</p>
      <p>Indiana corn farmers are on pace with nationwide corn progress. The state finished last week at 80%, well behind the five-year average of 91% and last year’s pace at 91%.</p>
      <p>Areas of Indiana saw up to an inch of precipitation across the state over the week. Delaware, Henry, Randolph and parts of surrounding counties were hit the hardest with up to three inches of precipitation, halting harvest progress for farmers in the area.</p>

      <h3>North Dakota</h3>
      <p>Soybean farmers in North Dakota lag behind on harvest progress at 84% last week, continuing behind the five-year average of 98% at this time. Last year at this time farmers were at 93% harvested.</p>
      <p>Farmers in North Dakota are the furthest behind on corn harvest progress with just 23% of the crop cut, up from just 15% last week. The five-year average for the state is much higher at 85%. Much of the delay was caused by early winter weather in mid-October, covering crops in North Dakota and South Dakota in feet of snow.</p>
      <p>Last week’s precipitation levels allowed for some progress throughout the week. Majority of rain/snowfall was in the central part of the state with over 0.5 inches. Other areas of the state experienced from 0.1 to 0.4 inches of precipitation.</p>

      <h3>South Dakota</h3>
      <p>South Dakota soybean harvest is at 95% closing out last week, just slightly behind the five-year average at 99%.</p>
      <p>However, South Dakota corn harvest is on track with majority of Midwestern states lagging behind at 53%, up from 39% the week prior. The five-year average is 91% and in 2018 at this time, corn harvest was at 80%. South Dakota did see some of North Dakota’s snowfall during the early harvest window in October, slowing corn harvest progress.</p>
      <p>Western parts of South Dakota saw the most precipitation last week with totals up to 0.6 inches. As you move east, precipitation amounts lesson up to 0.05 inches in the most eastern half of the state for favorable fieldwork throughout the week.</p>

      <h3>Kansas</h3>
      <p>Soybean harvest in Kansas is sitting right at the five-year average of 92% up from last year at this time of 80%.</p>
      <p>Similarly, corn harvest progress in Kansas is also looking favorable sitting just 1% behind the five-year average of 96%. In 2018 at this time, just 92% of the corn crop had been harvested.</p>
      <p>The Sunflower State also saw the least precipitation amounts last week. The southwestern portion and parts of central Kansas saw little to no rainfall throughout the week while the eastern and northern part of the state saw between 0.05 to 0.25 inches, allowing for very favorable field work throughout last week.</p>

      <h3>Wisconsin</h3>
      <p>Soybean harvest progress is the furthest behind for Wisconsin farmers with 77% of the crop harvested, steadily behind the five-year average pace at 95%. Last year at this time, 90% of the soybean crop was cut.</p>
      <p>Similarly, Wisconsin corn farmers are also substantially behind the five-year average pace of 77% at just 44% harvested at the end of last week. Last year at this time, the state was up from the five-year average pace at 78% harvested.</p>

      <p>Ohio corn farmers reached 75% corn harvested last week, still significantly behind the five-year average of 87% and last year’s pace of 81%.</p>
      <p>Northern parts of Ohio saw the most precipitation last week at amounts totaling 1.86 to 0.92 inches. Moving south down the state, Ohio saw less precipitation amounts with areas totaling less than an inch of rainfall.</p>
