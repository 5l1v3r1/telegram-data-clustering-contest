      <p>Reaching Number 4 in the UK Albums Chart, ‘Love Angel Music Baby’ also received high acclaim from critics upon its release. <a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/reviews-nme-7561">In a four-star review, <i>NME</i> said</a>: “[It’s] one of the most frivolously brilliant slabs of shiny retro-pop anyone’s had the chutzpah to release all year. And that includes <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/the-killers">The Killers</a>.”</p>
      <p>Back in 2017, Gwen Stefani released her ‘You Make It Feel Like Christmas’ festive album. It followed on from 2016’s ‘<a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/reviews-gwen-stefani-16424">This Is What The Truth Feels Like</a>’.</p>
