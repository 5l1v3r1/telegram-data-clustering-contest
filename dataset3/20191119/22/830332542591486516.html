      <h1>State DNR warns gun deer hunters of risky terrain, waterway conditions</h1>

      <p>MADISON, Wis. - The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources is urging hunters to check their hunting areas before the gun deer-hunting season starts Saturday.</p>
      <p>Wisconsin DNR Chief Conservation Warden Todd Schaller noted that hunters are usually fans of some light snow to help track deer. "However, the ground is saturated statewide, leaving wet conditions and ice forming on ponds, lakes, streams," he said.</p>
      <p>Given the early winter weather this year, the DNR recommends avoiding ice whenever possible. "No one needs the surprise of a sudden fall into deep water or a slip on icy mud. What you thought is normal is not normal this year," Schaller said.</p>
      <p>Other tips include going hunting with a friend, wearing proper clothing and equipment, carrying spikes with rope to help if anyone falls through the ice, keep a cellphone with you and tell people where you are going and when you expect to be back.</p>
