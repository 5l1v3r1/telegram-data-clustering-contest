      <h1>How online retailers are combatting an increasing amount of returns</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T22:08:36+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 22:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/zona-black/" target="_blank">Zona Black</a></address>
      <p>Online retailers will be forced to drastically change the way they operate as consumers rebel against return policies that are decimating the planet.</p>
      <p>The finger is being particularly pointed at Amazon Prime in the US, which entices customers to its platform with extremely low-cost items delivered the day after ordering.</p>
      <p><i>Bloomberg</i> last week <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-11-13/those-amazon-returns-they-re-killing-the-environment?srnd=opinion&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=view&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-view&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic">revealed</a> American shoppers will return more than one million packages every day in December – creating an estimated 22.6 billion kilograms of landfill for the US, and 15 million tonnes of carbon emissions.</p>
      <p>Those sorts of figures are likely to be mirrored in Australia, said Queensland University of Technology’s Gary Mortimer, who specialises in marketing and consumer behaviour.</p>
      <p>“When you think about the growth of online we can also think about the environmental impact it has,” Associate Professor Mortimer told <i>The New Daily</i>.</p>
      <p>“Customers don’t think about it, but they should.”</p>
      <p>But it won’t stay that way for long – more consumers are making <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/money/consumer/2019/09/19/shop-ethical-climate-consume/">environmentally conscious purchases</a>, he said.</p>
      <h3>The true cost of free returns</h3>
      <p>More and more e-commerce businesses are fighting for shoppers’ dollars by offering free deliveries and “hassle-free returns”.</p>
      <p>The knock-on effect is consumers are buying with a “she’ll be right” attitude if the product doesn’t meet the hype, or doesn’t fit, knowing they won’t be pinged for an exchange or return.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>Associate Professor Mortimer explained the environmental impacts of online shopping were doubled – at least – when returns were factored in.</p>
      <p>It’s forward and reverse logistics, he explained.</p>
      <p>“We all buy these individual items and products and expect individual drivers in individual trucks to deliver them,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It’s what we call the cost of the last mile of delivery. That’s lots of cars, lots of trucks, burning lots of fuel.”</p>
      <p>And if the product isn’t right, and needs to be returned? Run the whole process in reverse – more packaging, more transport and more fuel.</p>

      <h3>Getting it right the first time</h3>
      <p>While a growing push towards ethically minded consumerism could force retailers to alter their shipping and returns methods – think sustainable/recycled packaging or free in-store returns – it’s more likely we will see retailers trying new ways to get the order right <i>before</i> it hits the delivery van.</p>
      <p>Associate Professor Mortimer said we will see a growing merge between traditional bricks-and-mortar retailing, with online shopping.</p>
      <p>For the past few years, some department stores and retailers have introduced in-store kiosks that marry the two shopping styles, particularly when it comes to customised goods.</p>
      <p>Apparel companies are setting up kiosks in stores that allow customers to touch and try on items before ordering a personalised version, which is later delivered to their homes.</p>
      <p>“The idea is that you order it in store and then it gets delivered to your house – it removes the risk,” Associate Professor Mortimer said.</p>
      <p>Browsing in store and buying the item online, in the aisle, is becoming so popular that it’s garnered its own name: Showrooming.</p>
      <p>The other thing retailers should be considering (and some are doing), is playing the good conscience card, Associate Professor Mortimer said.</p>
      <p>If it’s an extremely low-cost item that the shopper wants to return for a different size, the retailer should look at waving the return factor and just sending out the right product, he said.</p>
