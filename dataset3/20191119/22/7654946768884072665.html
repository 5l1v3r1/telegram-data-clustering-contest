      <h1>Pirates’ Felipe Vazquez faces 21 new felonies after police find ‘child porn’ stash</h1>

      <p>Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Felipe Vazquez is facing 21 additional charges in his ongoing sexual assault case after investigators said Tuesday they found evidence of child pornography on his phone and laptop.</p>
      <p>Vazquez, 28, was arrested in September for allegedly sexually assaulting a 13-year-old girl in 2017.</p>
      <p>Police found seven photographs and three videos of a girl “in various stages of nudity” during a subsequent search of Vazquez’s iPhone XS and Apple MacBook Pro, according to court documents. Police said Vazquez asked for the photos and videos from the girl.</p>
      <p>That led authorities in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, to tack on 10 counts of child pornography, 10 counts of unlawful contact with a minor and one count of corruption of a minor. All 21 charges are listed as third-degree felonies, each carrying a maximum of seven years in prison.</p>
      <p>The MLB All-Star <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/09/25/pittsburgh-pirates-closer-felipe-vazquez-denied-bail-in-child-sex-case/">told police during a September interrogation</a> that he had “sexual intercourse inside of his vehicle,” with a 13-year-old in August 2017 in Scottdale, Pennsylvania, according to a criminal complaint. He said he and the teen had “sex, but not really,” because their encounter was cut short.</p>
      <p>They allegedly then exchanged multiple graphic text messages; in one, Vazquez said he planned to “finish the deed” with her.</p>
      <p>Vazquez also faces charges of solicitation of a child and providing obscene material to a minor in Florida, where the alleged victim’s mother first reported the relationship. The judge in Pennsylvania on Tuesday denied Florida’s request for extradition. He is being held without bail.</p>
      <p>Vazquez, a fireballing left-hander with 89 career saves, was placed on administrative leave by MLB in September.</p>
