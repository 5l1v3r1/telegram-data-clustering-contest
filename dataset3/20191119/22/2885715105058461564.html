      <p>Residents in several parts of the western suburbs were in for a surprise when the found no water supply Tuesday morning. Complaints were received from people living in areas including Juhu, Andheri and Jogeshwari, who said they had to call in tankers for even basic water needs.</p>
      <p>Dhaval Shah, living in Lokhandwala, said residents were forced to call all tankers. “Many housing societies in Andheri and Oshiwara were dependent on tankers for their daily needs,” he said. “…There was no alert from the civic body on this issue. We got to know from our corporator that there was some leakage in a water pipeline, which will affect regular supply.” He added that they do not know if water will come on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Officials of the water department said the supply was affected after leakage was detected in two main lines supplying water to Bandra, Andheri and Jogeshwari. “The leakage has been attended to and the supply has been restored,” an official from the Hydraulic Engineering Department said.</p>
      <p>“The BMC should have told us to store water if they were aware of the leakage and repair was planned,” a resident from Jogeshwari said. “…From office goers to school students, everybody faced difficulties.”</p>
