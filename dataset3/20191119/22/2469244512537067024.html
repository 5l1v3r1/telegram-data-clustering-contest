      <p>Exeter City boss Matt Taylor has said the Grecians were the only side trying to win the game after a 1-0 win over Cambridge United.</p>
      <p>The U’s had just two shots on goal, none on target, and failed to trouble Jonny Maxted in City’s goal all evening.</p>
      <p>Alex Fisher got the win for the Grecians in the 70 minute when he turned in a Ben Seymour cross which ensures a home tie against non-league Hartlepool United on December 1.</p>
      <p>Taylor, speaking after the win, said it was difficult about a team who put so many bodies behind the ball, but was delighted to have seen his side go through.</p>
      <p>He said: “That could have been a difficult night tonight, but sometimes you need something to ignite yourselves and the fans and I thought our substitutions did that in the second half.</p>

      <p>“Maybe it is a sign of respect that opposition teams are showing us at the moment. It’s is not easy to break a team down with so many bodies behind the ball and when they are so deep, the space just isn’t there and maybe we aren’t good enough at times to break that down.</p>
      <p>“It certainly isn’t for the want of trying. Those players have given everything they possibly could, so I was delighted with the impact those boys made and we were the only team trying to win that game.”</p>
      <p>Seymour had replaced Lee Martin and created the only goal of the game within five minutes of his arrival, and Taylor said: “The goal was a moment of quality. We had fresh legs in terms of Ben Seymour and it was the only time we really got behind their backline because there just wasn’t the space to do so. I was delighted with the impact those boys made and delighted for Fish to get his goal.”</p>

      <p>In a game of few chances, it took until the 57 minute for either side to have a shot on target when a Lee Martin effort from 30 yards was hit straight at Callum Burton in the U’s goal, which saw ironic applause and chants of ‘we’ve had a shot’ from the Big Bank.</p>
      <p>And Taylor said: “I would ask that the fans really stick by us in those moments. It was a really testing time and the questions have to be answered, but I thought we did that tonight.”</p>
