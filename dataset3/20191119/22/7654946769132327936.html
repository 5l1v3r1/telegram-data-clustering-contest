      <h1>NYC could be next prostitution hub if legalized: trafficking survivors</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T22:57:11+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 22:57</time> by <a rel="author">Gabrielle Fonrouge</a></address>
      <p>As progressive Democrats in Albany gear up to <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/06/17/andrew-cuomo-scraps-last-minute-effort-to-legalize-prostitution/">reintroduce a bill</a> that would legalize prostitution in New York, two women who were exploited within Nevada’s legal sex trade are supporting a different kind of bill — one that that would shield prostitutes from arrest, but still charge the pimps and johns that fuel the trade. </p>
      <p>Trafficking survivors Rebecca Bender, 38, and Bekah Charleston, 37, spoke at an event Monday night in Manhattan where they detailed the “horrific” experience of being sold across the country, including in New York, and how the Big Apple is destined to be the next prostitution “hub” if the act is legalized. </p>
      <p>“I was [trafficked at] the Waldorf Astoria, the W Hotel … it’s just scary to think about what could happen in the city,” said Bender, who was a 19-year-old single mom in college when she was coerced into prostitution back in 2001.  </p>
      <p>“A lot of people think, ‘Oh it’s this nice lavish life’ — I was beaten constantly, my face was broken in several places,” Bender said, adding she’d nearly been killed by johns and her own pimp dozens of times.</p>
      <p>Bender and Charleston are hoping a new bill to be introduced in January by state Sen. Liz Krueger (D-Manhattan) and Assemblyman Tremaine Wright (D-Brooklyn) based on the “equality model” will pass in lieu of full legalization. </p>
      <p>The equality model, also known as the “Nordic model,” was first started in Sweden before moving to Denmark, Iceland, Ireland, Israel and France and focuses on arresting only pimps and buyers, not prostituted people. </p>
      <p>Bender and Charleston said a recent push in New York to legalize all aspects of the sex trade, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/06/10/state-lawmakers-introduce-bill-to-legalize-prostitution/">spearheaded by progressive state Senators Julia Salazar and Jessica Ramos</a>, is out of touch and not the vehicle to female empowerment legislators have billed it to be. </p>

      <p>“The daily realities of what it’s like working in prostitution or sex trafficking are horrific. I’ve been raped more times than I care to count, robbed at gunpoint, strangled with guns to my head,” said Charleston, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/06/02/former-sex-worker-dont-legalize-prostitution-in-new-york/">who spoke with The Post back in June.</a></p>
      <p>Bender said one of the movement’s slogans, “Sex work is real work,” couldn’t be farther from the truth. </p>
      <p>“This is not work like any other work, it’s dangerous. Every time you knock on that door [to meet a buyer] it feels like you’re playing Russian Roulette. You don’t know if you’re going to be beaten or raped, you don’t know if you’re going to come home to your kids. It’s just this cycle of a constant state of fear,” Bender said. </p>
      <p>“We are not seeing these same effects of fear in teachers and garbage persons and people who do normal work.” </p>
      <p>Charleston said every form of prostitution, from “the gritty streets” to upscale “suites,” is harmful and demeaning. </p>
      <p>“Every single day I was still a monkey on a stick and I had to do things that I would have never done,” Charleston said. </p>
      <p>“Nobody wakes up and says I’m going to lay on my back and let people do whatever they want to me for money. That just doesn’t happen. It’s either out of force or out of dire circumstances.” </p>
      <p>Charleston also noted the long term effects of being a prostitute and how it’s something many women still in the trade aren’t fully aware of. </p>
      <p>“When I did finally leave, I had a million dollars of debt in my name, I’d been abused for a decade, I’d been arrested ten times, had a federal felony, I had no job experience. I mean what was I going to do?” Charleston railed. </p>
      <p>“I celebrated my ten year anniversary of freedom this year and it still follows you around. Let alone the trauma, PTSD, the shame, stigmatization and embarrassment and guilt that people in prostitution feel over their experiences.”</p>
      <p>Charleston and Bender are hopeful the equality model will prevail over full legalization when New York’s legislative session reopens in January.</p>
      <p>“We will not decriminalize the entire sex trade and allow pimps and brothel owners to operate with impunity,” Bender said. </p>
      <p>“That’s just ridiculous.” </p>
