      <h1>Joe Root's message to Jofra Archer as England face off against New Zealand</h1>
      <h2>The England captain wants his fastest bowler to blow away New Zealand and has told him not to 'underestimate' his own talent</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T22:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 22:00</time> by <a rel="author">Dean Wilson, https://www.facebook.com/DeanWilsonCricketMirror/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/joe-root">Joe Root</a> has told <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jofra-archer">Jofra Archer</a> to use his raw pace to fire <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/england-cricket-team">England</a> to victory in New Zealand.</p>
      <p>And rather than worry too much about swinging and seaming the ball, he wants his fastest bowler to blow away the Black Caps batting line-up.</p>
      <p>Archer is much more than a one trick pony with a ball in his hands, but trying to persuade him that he might not need to use his entire repertoire could be Root’s greatest challenge as he tries to use brute force to beat the Kiwis.</p>
      <p>“Knowing Jofra, he wants to see the ball moving sideways,” said Root. “But one thing he underestimates is his own talent sometimes and that pace through the air can be quite a big skill in its own.</p>
      <p>“I just want him to go and bowl and enjoy bowling, the different challenges that this part of the world will throw at him.</p>

      <p>“I want him to come away from it learning there is more than one way of taking 20 wickets, he doesn’t have to be seaming or swinging it round corners, we’ve already seen hostile spells of bowling. Can he tailor that to these conditions?</p>
      <p>“That’s a skill in itself. He makes it look ridiculously easy with the his action and the way he approaches the crease, the nature of his style, but to be able to bowl at that pace for a period of time is a skill in itself and I think he needs to understand that.”</p>

      <p>Bowling this fast is a gift, but it can also be a fragile one, and the last thing Root wants to do is damage his golden arm.</p>
      <p>“One thing I have learned is that he has a huge hunger for wickets,” added Root.</p>
      <p>“He wants to be in the game and once you get the ball in his hand he can be very hard to get it off.</p>
      <p>“It’s a great trait to have but you want him to bowl as many spells as possible over 90mph, not one a series or once in a blue moon. That’s something over time we’ll get better at.”</p>
