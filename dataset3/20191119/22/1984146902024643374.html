      <p>While we're very glad it was him rather than us, Andrew Maxwell made some VERY random noises during the latest I'm A Celebrity Bushtucker Trial.</p>
      <p>All five celebrities in Snake Rock - <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/who-andrew-maxwell-im-celebrity-17266226">Andrew</a> , Ian Wright, Jacqueline Jossa, Caitlyn Jenner and James Haskell had to undertake the Trial which was called Face Your Fears. </p>
      <p>Ant and Dec explained that viewers had been voting for what critters each celebrity would have to face. </p>
      <p>They would have to put their head into a clear Perspex helmet and their hands into a box.  They would have two minutes to release two stars using the tools provided. </p>
      <p>There were two stars each, making a total of ten possible stars and ten meals for camp.</p>
      <p>Irish comedian Andrew was second up.  He winced as cockroaches were poured into the helmet and into the box in front of him. </p>
      <p>He calmed himself by making some very weird and VERY distracting groaning noises as he slowly unscrewed the star.  Like James he managed to release the first star but despite being encouraged by his fellow campmates, he didn't quite manage to release the second star in time.</p>
      <p>But it wasn't the stars that quickly got I'm A Celeb viewers talking, it was Andrew's noises.</p>

      <p>People were torn on what they reminded them off. One viewer joked "Andrew sounds like me trying to start my old Fiesta when I was 18," while another reacted "Andrew sounds like the mummy out of scooby doo doing that bushtucker trial," and a third tweeted "Those noises from Andrew sounds like he's constipated... The rest of the camp mates better get used to that as constipation day will come with all those beans and rice they are consuming."</p>
