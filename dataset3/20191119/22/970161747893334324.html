      <p>Michael Owen has backed <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-city-fc/">Manchester City</a> to bounce back from their disappointing defeat at Liverpool with a victory over <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/chelsea-fc/">Chelsea</a> this weekend.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/pep-guardiola/">Pep Guardiola</a>’s champions have so far failed to replicate their imperious form of last term and sit fourth in the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a>, nine points adrift of leaders Liverpool.</p>
      <p>City’s title chances were dealt a major blow as they lost 3-1 at Anfield before the international break and Jurgen Klopp’s men are undoubtedly the team to beat 12 matches into the season.</p>
      <p>Despite an underwhelming start to the campaign, Owen believes City will see off Frank Lampard’s impressive Chelsea side on Saturday afternoon.</p>

      <p>Predicting a win for City and both teams to score, Owen told <i>BetVictor</i>: ‘The game of the weekend is at the Etihad and champions Manchester City will leapfrog Chelsea in the table if they take all three points.</p>

      <p>‘City won the corresponding game 6-0 last season but Chelsea did win the reverse fixture at Stamford Bridge earlier in the season and only penalties were able to split the sides at Wembley in the League Cup Final back in February.</p>
      <p>‘After their defeat at Anfield in their previous game City cannot afford to drop points, especially at the Etihad, if they are to put pressure on Liverpool in their quest for a hat-trick of titles.</p>
      <p>‘Chelsea have improved under Frank Lampard and their exciting young side are confident and talented. But beware a wounded Pep Guardiola and his side – it will have been a long international break for the City boss.’</p>

      <p>Owen expects Liverpool to maintain their eight-point lead at the top of the table with a comfortable win over Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park.</p>
      <p>‘Palace have picked up just one point – at the Emirates – from their last four league games and have lost 2-0 against City, Leicester and Chelsea in that sequence.</p>
      <p>Liverpool have an eight-point lead at the top of the Premier League and I would be surprised if the Eagles stopped the Reds in their tracks such is the current form and confidence surrounding Jurgen Klopp’s squad.’</p>
      <p>The former England striker believes Arsenal have a ‘must win’ match at home to Southampton this weekend.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘Arsenal had just one shot on target in their latest league defeat on the road at the King Power Stadium and the Gunners have dropped points from winning positions in their last couple of games at the Emirates against Palace and Wolves,’ Owen said.</p>
      <p>‘Unai Emery’s side start the day eight points off fourth place in the table and I think this is a must win game for the Gunners’ boss given Saints sit just one point and one place off the foot of the table.’</p>
