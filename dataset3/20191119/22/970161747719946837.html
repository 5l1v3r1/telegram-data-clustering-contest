      <p>Roman Kemp and Adele Roberts have had the first clash of I’m a Celebrity 2019…over the now iconic Jane McDonald photo.</p>
      <p>The pair butt heads when Roman makes jokes about the Loose Women host, causing his radio DJ rival to get offended by his critique.</p>
      <p>Talking together in the main camp, Kate Garraway and Roman are talking about the picture, which Adele brought in as her ‘luxury item’.</p>
      <p>While <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/im-celebrity-star-adele-roberts-girlfriend-clears-jane-mcdonald-mystery-now-know-11183427/">Adele’s girlfriend Kate Holderness has since cleared up why she brought in the framed photo</a>, the campmates where nonethewiser.</p>
      <p>But Kate saw the plus side, as Kate asked: ‘Jane McDonald is looking over us, can you think of a song of hers?’</p>
      <p>Admitting she didn’t know any, Adele said: ‘I know her off Loose Women, I don’t know her actual songs but I know her from the cruising show when she does covers.’</p>

      <p>Adele then feels cornered by Myles and Roman who laugh at her, with Roman declared: ‘No one knows what she does.’</p>
      <p>As Kate backed up Adele and Jane, Roman put her on the spot, and asked her: ‘She’s a legend is she? Name a song?’</p>

      <p>When she couldn’t, Adele then hit back and defended the singing TV star’s honour, telling them about her work on Cruising With Jane McDonald that sees her focus on covers rather her own songs.</p>
      <p>Roman, dismissing her, said that it was just ‘random’, causing Adele to fight back.</p>
      <p>‘If I had brought in a picture of RuPaul would you have the same reaction?,’ she asked him, before adding: ‘That’s prejudice, I’m allowed to like what I want.’</p>

      <p>At this point Roman (finally!) clocked on that he might have upset his new campmate, and tried to calm the tension.</p>
      <p>‘I wasn’t saying that at all, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to,’ he told her, hugging her to diffuse the situation as he said the situation was ‘funny’ and he was trying to make light of it.</p>
      <p>Adele relented, but told him: ‘It’s fine, you are just going on about it so much…’</p>
      <p>‘I like the picture being there,’ Roman later told her.</p>

      <p>While Adele might be bummed out by the mocking, she shouldn’t be -seeing as Jane herself watched the show in her pants last night and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/jane-mcdonald-watched-im-celebs-adele-roberts-luxury-item-reveal-pants-gives-seal-approval-11180740/">gave her the McDonald seal of approval. </a></p>
      <p>And to think we’re only on day three…</p>
