        <b>Christmas just got a whole lot more exciting as iconic Friends props are going up for auction.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Time to bid your life’s savings on the turkey head with sunglasses.</p>
      <p>Fans of the ‘90s sitcom can bid on the props and costumes which include Joey’s stuffed penguin Hugsy, Rachel’s Hawaiian dress, and Monica and Chandler’s wedding invitation.</p>
      <p>Obviously, these are limited items so people need to act fast. Could we BE any more competitive?</p>
      <p>The auction, <a href="http://propstore.com/Friends">organised by Prop Store</a>, will offer more than 100 items that span across all 10 seasons of the sitcom.</p>
      <p>Hugsy and the wedding invitation are expected to fetch between $1,000 and $1,500 (£750-£1,150) with Chandler’s wood canoe potentially selling for $6,000 (£4,600).</p>

      <p>Brandon Alinger, COO of Prop Store, said: ‘Prop Store is thrilled to be working with Warner Bros to auction some incredible material from all 10 seasons of Friends.</p>

      <p>‘The series gave us so many laughs during its original run and continues to entertain and inspire fans around the world.</p>
      <p>‘It’s an honour to be able to bring some amazing original pieces to the fans, such as Joey’s original Hugsy doll.’</p>

      <p>He continued: ‘We’re also happy to offer detailed studio-edition reproductions, including the Holiday Armadillo costume, Central Perk couch and 10 copies of Monica’s peephole door frame, straight from the Warner Bros props department.’</p>
      <p>Does anyone have $50,000 we can borrow for this auction?</p>
      <p>The best part about the auction is that the VHS of the spoof porn film made by Phoebe’s sister Ursula, Buffay the Vampire Layer, is also up for sale.</p>
      <p>Also, in case you need a costume to teach your son about Hannukah, the Armadillo costume Ross wore might be the one for you.</p>
      <p>Proceeds from the auction will benefit The Trevor Project, the world’s largest suicide prevention and crisis intervention organisation for LGBTQ+ young people.</p>
