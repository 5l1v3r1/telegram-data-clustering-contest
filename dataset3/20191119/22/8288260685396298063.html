      <p>Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson were asked if the Duke of York is "fit for purpose" during the first leaders' debate of the General Election campaign.</p>
      <p>ITV's Julie Etchingham quizzed the two prime ministerial hopefuls in light of questions over Andrew's friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who took his own life in jail while facing sex trafficking charges.</p>
      <p>The Queen's second son has been accused of showing a lack of empathy with Epstein's victims and a lack of remorse for his friendship with the disgraced financier.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Labour leader Mr Corbyn and his Tory counterpart Mr Johnson were initially asked if the monarchy was fit for purpose.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn replied: "Needs a bit of improvement."</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson said: "The institution of the monarchy is beyond reproach."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Asked about the duke, Mr Corbyn said: "Before we discuss Prince Andrew I think we should discuss the victims that are there because of what Epstein was doing.</p>
      <p>"I think there are very, very serious questions that must be answered and nobody should be above the law, but the primary position ought to be the proper treatment of those people who were victims of the most appalling behaviour by apparently Epstein and many others."</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Mr Johnson said "all our sympathies" should be with the victims of Epstein, adding: "The law must certainly take its course."</p>
