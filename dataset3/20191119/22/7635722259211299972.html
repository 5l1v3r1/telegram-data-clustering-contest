      <h1>Stunning Ireland U21s thrash Sweden in Tallaght</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T22:22:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 22:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.newstalk.com/author/raf-diallo" target="_blank">Raf Diallo</a></address>

        <b>Like the senior team, the Ireland U21s<a href="https://www.offtheball.com/soccer/ireland-1-1-denmark-performance-came-late-926517"> faced Nordic opposition</a> tonight.</b>
      </p>
      <p>But for Stephen Kenny's side, it proved to be a sparkling performance as they thrashed Sweden 4-1 at Tallaght Stadium.</p>
      <p>But it required them to battle back from a deficit.</p>
      <p>Sweden took the lead on 18 minutes through Viktor Gyökeres and it's a lead the visitors held until half-time.</p>
      <h3>Second-Half Whirlwind</h3>

      <p>But the second-half was a completely different story as Ireland U21s blew Sweden away.</p>
      <p>Four minutes after the break, Lee O'Connor equalised after good work from Adam Idah down the byline.</p>
      <p>O'Connor, who made his senior debut against New Zealand last Thursday, applied the finish to the cut-back.</p>
      <p>On 64 minutes, it was Idah's turn to find the net. Again it was a cross from the right flank, this time from Elbouzedi.</p>
      <p>Idah took up a similar position to O'Connor minutes earlier before a finish low into the net.</p>
      <p>With 16 minutes to go, another recent Ireland senior debutant would find the net.</p>
      <h3>Group</h3>

      <p>Troy Parrott ran onto Connor Ronan's deflected ball over the top and finished precisely to make it 3-1.</p>
      <p>Ronan would also assist the fourth goal, setting up Zak Elbouzedi to tap in from a low left-wing cross.</p>
      <p>The commanding win means Ireland stay top of Euro 2021 qualifying Group 1 on 16 points from seven games.</p>
      <p>However, Italy are three points behind and have two games in hand in the best runners-up place.</p>
