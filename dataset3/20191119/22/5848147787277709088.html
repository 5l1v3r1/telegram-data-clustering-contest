      <h1>Marriage Story is a love story about divorce and one of the year’s best films</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T22:11:51+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 22:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/simonemitchell/" target="_blank">Simone Mitchell</a></address>
      <p>My freshly divorced mate cancelled our plans to see <i>Marriage Story</i> at the last minute.</p>
      <p>After viewing the trailer online he messaged me and said, “Upon further consideration, no f—–g way”.</p>
      <p>It was probably a fair call. This deep dive into marriage breakdown will certainly trigger a heart-lurch in anyone who has gone through a painful relationship implosion.</p>
      <p>But to avoid <i>Marriage Story</i> would be a shame, because it is one of the year’s most incredible films and Netflix’s biggest Oscars hope yet.</p>
      <p>It tells the story of Charlie (Adam Driver), an avant-garde New York theatre director and wife Nicole (Scarlett Johansson), an ex-Hollywood film actor who gave up her life on the west coast to join Charlie’s theatre company.</p>
      <p>Despite still caring for one another, their relationship has run its course.</p>
      <p>They want different lives and they are attempting to navigate a gentle separation for their son’s sake.</p>
      <p>But when lawyers become involved they find themselves doing things they never thought they’d do.</p>
      <p>The reason <i>Marriage Story</i> resonates is because it’s nuanced.</p>
      <p>There’s no clear good guy or bad guy.</p>
      <p>Both characters are charming people with good intentions, who make very human mistakes along the way. You can empathise with everyone involved.</p>
      <p>The writer’s searing insight means the script is littered with relatable relationship breakdown moments that will sucker-punch you every now and then.</p>
      <p>The movie finely balances pleasure and pain, just like many relationships.</p>

      <p>Instead of being a steadily gut-wrenching film like other works in the divorce canon – looking at you, <i>Kramer vs Kramer</i> – there is just enough humour and life-affirming kindness to act as a balm for the painful bits.</p>
      <p>It’s not the total emotional bin-fire my friend feared.</p>
      <p>Disney/Pixar favourite Randy Newman has composed a score that lends jauntiness when required, and there are bursts of (actual) song and dance to provide a reprieve from the heavy dialogue.</p>
      <p>Both Johansson and Driver have rightly generated ‘Oscars buzz’. They are natural, intense, hilarious and heartbreaking.</p>

      <p>The leads are beautifully supported by <a href="https://inews.co.uk/culture/film/laura-dern-interview-marriage-story-release-noah-baumbach-986776">Laura Dern</a> as Nicole’s ruthless attorney (look out for her high-octane monologue about God and motherhood, which has been met with applause at screenings), and the superbly laconic Alan Alda as Charlie’s lawyer.</p>
      <p>The film is being heralded as Noah Baumbach’s best film.</p>
      <p>The writer/director also tackled divorce – from the children’s perspective – in 2005’s <i>The Squid and the Whale, </i>and <i>Marriage Story</i> is understood to be partly inspired by his <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2019/07/marriage-story-noah-baumbach-interview-1202160423/">split from actor Jennifer Jason Leigh</a>.</p>
      <p>As a director, Baumbach has a reputation as a perfectionist who shoots a huge number of takes.</p>
      <p>This method took its toll on the actors in one intense scene where Charlie and Nicole eventually thrash it out in a room by themselves.</p>
      <p>The emotionally gruelling 10-minute scene was rehearsed and filmed over a week, with both Johansson and Driver repeatedly going to places of extreme anguish and anger.</p>
      <p>Driver described the experience as “exhausting” to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/making-marriage-story-how-noah-baumbach-crafted-his-love-story-divorce-1250713"><i>The Hollywood Reporter</i></a> and Johansson recalls Baumbach bought them each a bottle of wine afterwards, “which I probably immediately uncorked”.</p>
      <p>But the result of this meticulous style of directing is a truly visceral scene that will stay with you long after the credits have rolled.</p>

      <p>Interestingly, Baumbach describes his latest cinematic offering as “a love story about divorce”, telling the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/movies/story/2019-09-05/marriage-story-noah-baumbach-netflix"><i>Los Angeles Times</i></a> “it’s about a couple coming apart in divorce, but also a family coming together in a new way post-divorce”.</p>
      <p>That fits with reviewer G Allen Johnson’s pretty perfect summary of <i>Marriage Story</i> as “a film about divorce that celebrates life’s journeys”.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the film begins with a sunny montage that would live happily in any rom-com.</p>
      <p>In it, Nicole and Charlie take turns reading letters where they describe all the things they adore and admire about each other.</p>
      <p>Later in the film, Alda’s character describes divorce as “like a death without a body”.</p>
      <p>With that quote in mind, these opening love letters represent what is at the heart of Baumbach’s remarkable film – a loving eulogy for a relationship that is no longer.</p>
      <p>
        <b><i>Marriage Story</i> is showing in limited cinemas before it rolls out on Netflix on December 6</b>
