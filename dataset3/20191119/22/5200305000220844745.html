      <p>Peace TV’s two services, Peace TV English and Peace TV Urdu, have suddenly disappeared from the Sky EPG.</p>
      <p>The Islamic channels have been broadcasting for a number of years on the Sky platform, hence the move comes a surprise. Peace TV English was available on EPG 740 and Peace TV Urdu on EPG 747.</p>
      <p>Recently, Prime TV and B4U Plus were also abruptly removed from the Sky EPG.</p>
