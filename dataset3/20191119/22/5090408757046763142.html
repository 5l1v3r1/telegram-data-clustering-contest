      <p>Two guards who were on duty the night Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide were charged on Tuesday with falsifying prison records.</p>
      <p>Toval Noel and Michael Thomas were accused of failing to check in on Epstein every half-hour, and falsifying documents after saying they had, according to the <a href="https://apnews.com/f887ca30493b412896c6a46eb60836d2">Associated Press</a>. Both pleaded not guilty.</p>
      <p>Investigators believe the two fell asleep for several hours before Epstein was found dead from a suicide the morning of August 10.</p>

      <p>Epstein was being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan while he awaited trial on sex-trafficking charges. He had pleaded not guilty to the charges. His cell was in a high-security unit famous for holding terrorists and drug cartel leaders.</p>
      <p>Epstein was placed on suicide watch on July 23 after he was found on the floor of his cell with bruising to his neck. But he was taken off suicide a week before his death.</p>
      <p>Both guards were working overtime due to staffing shortages. They were both placed on administrative leave while the FBI and Justice Department’s inspector general investigated Epstein’s death. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ap-sources-jail-guards-at-time-of-epstein-death-reject-deal-2019-11">They previously rejected a plea deal from prosecutors, who wanted them to admit to falsifying the records.</a></p>
      <p>Despite the city’s medical examiner ruling Epstein’s death a suicide, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jeffrey-epstein-death-meme-conspiracy-clinton-global-elites-deceiving-2019-11">numerous conspiracy theories have sprouted up</a> after his death, due Epstein’s connections to prominent men like Britain’s Prince Andrew, former President Bill Clinton, and President Donald Trump. But the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/press-release/file/1218466/download">indictment</a> unsealed on Tuesday reports that surveillance footage shows that no one entered Epstein’s cell around the time of his death.</p>
