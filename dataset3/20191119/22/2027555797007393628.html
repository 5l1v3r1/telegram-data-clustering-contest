      <p>Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa is likely to intervene to quell a rebellion in Vijayanagar Legislative Assembly constituency ahead of the December 5 byelection.</p>
      <p>The efforts of Deputy Chief Minister Govind Karjol, Health Minister Sriramulu and BJP general secretary N Ravikumar’s have failed to convince rebel candidate Kaviraj Urs to withdraw his nomination papers.</p>
      <p>Urs has not lent ear to the aides of the chief minister who have assured him that he would be appointed as the chairman of a board or corporation. Hence, the chief minister is said to be arriving here soon to convince Urs.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Urs had made his displeasure public when the party gave ticket to Anand Singh for the byelection. He later filed nomination papers as an independent candidate on Monday.</p>
      <p>The party leaders had calculated that Urs would maintain distance from the party. But they are now worried as he has entered the fray.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, former MLA H R Gaviyappa and BJP Mahila Morcha state president Rani Samyuktha are also not taking part in the party’s activities. Gaviyappa has not entered the constituency after Singh received the party’s ticket. Gaviyappa had earlier rejected the chairmanship of Small Industries Corporation too. Minister Sriramulu’s efforts to convince him and Samyuktha have gone vain.</p>
