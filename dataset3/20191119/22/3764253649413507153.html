      <p>A member of the House of Representatives from Kogi, Leke Abejide, has suggested that Nigeria should adopt the use of electronic voting as a way to end thuggery and violence during elections in the country.</p>
      <p>Abejide, a member of the African Democratic Congress (ADC), believes that the adoption of electronic voting system would ensure free and fair elections that would be held as credible.</p>
      <p>The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) said Abejide spoke in Abuja on Tuesday, November 19, concerning the recently concluded elections in his state and Bayelsa said to have been characterised by violence.</p>

        <i>“Politics is not a do-or-die. Fighting or causing mayhem and killing is barbaric and I condemn it. We are going to come up with electronic voting system where people can vote using their phones.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>“In a case whereby someone is bringing the ballot box and it is snatched, we cannot get proper election with this system. We cannot get free, fair and credible election with the system of voting we use now,"</i> the lawmaker said.</p>
      <p>While asking parties not satisfied with the conduct of the election to go to court, he, however, promised to support whoever is eventually declared the winner.</p>
      <p>Ndudi Elumelu, minority leader of the House, also said he and his colleagues condemn the violence that took over the elections in Bayelsa and Kogi.</p>
      <p><i>“We (minority caucus of the house) are displeased and totally against what happened in last Saturday’s election. We are not impressed with the mode of conduct of the election given that many lives were lost,"</i> he said.</p>

        <i>“The level of violence orchestrated in just two states is disheartening; it is something that really needs to be investigated and we are calling on Mr President to take action on that.</i>
      </p>
