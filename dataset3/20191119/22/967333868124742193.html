      <p>According to UK-based media reports, Pochettino allegedly had a long-lasting conflict with club chairman Daniel Levy.</p>
      <blockquote>"We were extremely reluctant to make this change and <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201903281073619883-gordon-taylor-pfa-resigns/">it is not a decision</a> the Board has taken lightly, nor in haste [...] Regrettably domestic results at the end of last season and beginning of this season have been extremely disappointing", Levy said in the statement.</blockquote>

      <p>​According to The Telegraph, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/19/mauricio-pochettino-leaves-tottenham-hotspur-could-contenders/">citing sources</a>, Pochettino was devastated by the Champions League final defeat against Liverpool earlier this year and reportedly held a unique vision for the team's future roster, which contradicted Levy's stance.</p>
      <p>The club also said in the statement that the Argentine, along with his coaching staff of Jesus Perez, Miguel D’Agostino and Antoni Jimenez, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/sport/201905271075370036-uk-newcastle-football-club-sell/">have been relieved</a> of their duties.</p>
      <p>Media have noted that Levy must pay a high compensation to part ways with Pochettino and his staff, all of whom had signed new five-year contracts in May 2018.</p>
      <p>Pochettino was at the helm for 293 games and <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201905121074931677-theresa-may-english-football-champions-league/">delivered four successive</a> top-four Premier League finishes, challenging for the title in 2015/16 and 2016/17.</p>
