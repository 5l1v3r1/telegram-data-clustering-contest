      <p>A police sergeant who waved pepperoni pizza over a Jewish policewoman's meal has narrowly kept his job.</p>
      <p>Sergeant Gary Jacobs said "whoops, I will eat the incriminating evidence" after a piece of the meat fell onto the junior officer's special kosher pizza.</p>
      <p>The 43-year-old officer, based in Crawley in West Sussex, was hauled before a disciplinary panel on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The hearing at Sussex Police headquarters in Lewes was told that the Jewish officer, referred to only as "Pc A", was left feeling "mocked for her faith".</p>
      <p>Sgt Jacobs argued that the pizza incident was a misguided joke-gone-wrong and accepted that his actions amounted to misconduct, but not gross misconduct.</p>
      <p>However the panel decided what Sgt Jacobs did amounted to gross misconduct and told him that he came very close to having his career as a police officer ended.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The incident happened on March 8 when Sgt Jacobs, Pc A and other colleagues were relaxing before a shift eating pizza, the hearing was told.</p>
      <p>Amy Clarke, bringing the allegation on behalf of the police force, said: "Pc A had deliberately ordered a pizza that was compliant with her dietary requirements.</p>
      <p>"Sgt Jacobs picked up a piece of pepperoni pizza and dangled it over or near Pc A's food.</p>
      <p>"A piece of the pepperoni fell onto Pc A's pizza."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>This was despite being aware of Pc A's faith and another officer having just pointed out that her kosher pizza should be kept separate, Ms Clarke said.</p>
      <p>The panel heard that Sgt Jacobs "waved" a piece of pepperoni pizza over Pc A's kosher chicken pizza saying "technically not touching".</p>
      <p>When a piece of meat fell onto Pc A's meal he remarked: "Whoops, I will eat the incriminating evidence."</p>
      <p>The Jewish officer, who had only recently joined the force, was left feeling "embarrassed, isolated and as if she was being mocked for her faith", Ms Clarke said.</p>
      <p>Colin Banham, representing Sgt Jacobs, said: "No-one says this was a malicious act.</p>
      <p>"An incident that he bitterly regrets and one that he is clearly remorseful about.</p>
      <p>"There was no intention to contaminate food."</p>
      <p>He argued that the incident was not pre-meditated and happened in a "jocular atmosphere" when officers were relaxing before a shift began.</p>
      <p>He told the panel that Sgt Jacobs had been under various pressures in his home and work life at the time.</p>
      <p>Trevor Bowles, who has been managing Sgt Jacobs since he changed teams following the pizza incident, said he had been impressed with his work.</p>
      <p>He told the panel: "He has substantial potential if his skills are channelled in the right way.</p>
      <p>"There has been not one issue or concern in all of his interactions with my staff."</p>
      <p>After retiring to consider the facts, panel chair Michael Salter said: "This amounts to gross misconduct as it is a breach of the standards of professional behaviour so serious that dismissal would be justified.</p>
      <p>"Police officers exercise significant powers.</p>
      <p>"The misconduct regime is a key part of accountability framework."</p>
      <p>He said Sgt Jacobs' actions were "serious and they caused discredit to the police service".</p>
      <p>Speaking to Sgt Jacobs, he said: "Officer, I cannot tell you how close you came to losing your job today.</p>
      <p>"I have done this job for a number of years now.</p>
      <p>"I have not found any case that has fallen so close to the boundary as yours has."</p>
      <p>Sgt Jacobs will receive a final written warning as a result of the hearing.</p>
