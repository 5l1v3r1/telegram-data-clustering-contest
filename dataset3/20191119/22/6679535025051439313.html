      <h1>Proposal to cultivate cannabis in Odisha rejected</h1>
      <h2>Odisha is one of the leading ganja producing States in India; clandestine plantations are widespread in several districts</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T22:48:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 22:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Satyasundar-Barik-399/" target="_blank">Satyasundar Barik</a></address>
      <p>A proposal to allow cannabis cultivation for medicinal purposes in Odisha was rejected on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>“Many pharmaceutical industries were approaching us, seeking permission to undertake cannabis cultivation for medicinal use. They also wanted assured supply [of cannabis] from government agencies that can take up cannabis plantation,” said Sushil Kumar Lohani, State Excise Secretary. A high-level meeting was convened to take a call on the proposal at Lokseba Bhawan here.</p>
      <p>“We had referred the issue to the Law Department for its opinion on whethre cultivation of cannabis can be permitted. The Law Department has formally rejected the proposals, saying there is no such provision under existing laws to grow the illicit crop,” said Mr. Lohani.</p>
      <h3>Clandestine producea</h3>
      <p>Odisha is one of the leading <i>ganja</i> (cannabis) producing States in India. Clandestine cultivation is flourishing in remote forested areas in the State. Officially, more than 4 crore hemp plants, whose value was estimated at approximately ₹4,000 crore, have been destroyed in the past five years. To curb the plantation of cannabis unlawfully, the State Police, the Excise Department and the Narcotics Control Bureau have intensified enforcement of the law.</p>
      <p>As many as 13,706,989 hemp plants, whose approximate market value could be estimated at ₹1,370 crore, were destroyed in 2018-19. Similarly, 7,932,006 illicit plants worth ₹793 crore were set on fire in 2017-18.</p>
      <p>On average, 1,500 hemp plants can be grown in an acre. Upon harvesting, each hemp plant produces least 500 gm of <i>ganja</i>. Locally, the <i>ganja</i> is sold at about ₹2,000 per kg. There is, however, no report on the production of <i>charas</i>, another by-product, by refining parts of hemp plants further, in Odisha.</p>
      <h3>‘Stringent action’</h3>
      <p>“We are taking stringent action against the persons involved in cannabis cultivation and booking them under the strict provisions of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985,” Niranjan Pujari, State Excise Minister, told the Odisha Assembly on Monday.</p>
      <p>Cannabis plantations are widespread in districts such as Malkangiri, Sambalpur, Deogarh, Kandhamal, Boudh, Rayagada, Gajapati, Angul and Nayagarh. Law enforcement agencies have also stepped up action by arresting 1,822 persons and seizing close to 50,000 kg of <i>ganja </i>in the past five years.</p>
      <p>According to the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, cannabis cultivation is illegal. However, many advocate that cannabis can be used in medicines and in the manufacture of fabric. Former Biju Janata Dal MP and editor of the Odia daily <i>Dharitri</i>, Tathagata Satpathy, backs commercial cultivation of crop. Mr. Satpathy even wore a hemp<i> kurta</i> on a visit to Parliament House.</p>
