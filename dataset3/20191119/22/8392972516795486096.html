      <p>Roman Kemp and Adele Roberts got into an argument over Jane McDonald during I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here! and now they are both up for the next Bushtucker Trial.</p>
      <p>The two radio DJs were seen bickering over Loose Women star Jane McDonald, after Adele brought a photo of her into the jungle as her luxury item.</p>

      <p>Adele was one of only two campmates to successfully retrieve their luxury item on Monday, and the picture was hung up in the camp for all to see, much to the confusion of her fellow celebrities, including Roman.</p>
      <p>Kate Garraway kicked off the conversation when she asked: "Jane McDonald is looking over us, can you think of a song of hers?"</p>
      <p>And Radio 1 DJ Adele confessed: "I know her off Loose Women, I don’t know her actual songs but I know her from the cruising show when she does covers.</p>
      <p>"She’ll cruise around the world, for example she’d go to Iceland and then sing a Bjork or would go to the USA and sing Proud Mary."</p>
      <p>But the 40-year-old presenter became upset when Roman and Rak-Su singer Myles Stephenson began to laugh, and claimed "no-one knows" who Jane is.</p>
      <p>Roman said: "It’s just random mate."</p>
      <p>Adele hit back: "Why though? I don’t understand. If I had brought in a picture of Ru-Paul would you have the same reaction?</p>
      <p>"That’s prejudice, I’m allowed to like what I want. It’s like you’re saying 'why would I like Jane McDonald?'"</p>
      <p>When Roman, 26, realised he’d upset Adele he began to apologise, but insisted the situation was "funny".</p>
      <p>He said: "Adele it’s not, the situation is funny. I wasn’t saying that at all, I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to."</p>
      <p>The Capital FM DJ apologised again, and gave Adele a hug as he said he was fond of the picture.</p>
      <p>He told her: "I like the picture being there."</p>
      <p>Viewers quickly picked a corner, defending Roman over the strange spat.</p>

      <p>Tomorrow night the pair will take on the Bushtucker Trial...</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in the episode, all five of the Snake Rock campmates - Caitlyn Jenner, James Haskell, Ian Wright, Jacqueline Jossa, and Andrew Maxwell - faced the Bush Tucker Trial, in which they won seven out of a possible 10 stars, and therefore bagged seven meals for camp.</p>
      <p>After the trial, they were allowed to enter the main camp, marking the first time this series that all 10 campmates have been based in the same camp.</p>
