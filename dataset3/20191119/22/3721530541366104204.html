      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T22:50:53+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 22:50</time> by <a rel="author">Michael McWhertor</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/pokemon-sword-shield/40501"><i>Pokémon Sword</i> and <i>Shield</i></a> — OK, technically just <i>Pokémon Shield</i> — has a dire message about the impact of climate change on our world. Corsola, the adorable pink coral Pokémon, has a new regional form in <i>Pokémon Sword</i> and <i>Shield</i> that serves as a somber warning about our changing environment.</p>
      <p>The standard Corsola, which has been part of the Pokédex since <i>Pokémon Gold</i> and <i>Silver</i>, is a cheerful, pinkish little Pokémon. Previous games in the franchise have warned that pollution or dirty will cause Corsola to migrate to cleaner waters, lest they lose their color and deteriorate.</p>
      <p>But the description of the new Galarian Corsola in <i>Pokémon Shield</i> paints a harrowing picture about the fate of Corsola having faced the effects of climate change. Normally, Corsola is a water/rock-type Pokémon. But its Galarian form is, sadly enough, ghost-type.</p>

      <p>“Sudden climate change wiped out this ancient kind of Corsola,” reads Galarian Corsola’s Pokédex entry in <i>Pokémon Shield</i>. “This Pokémon absorbs others’ life-force through its branches.” (The description differs in <i>Pokémon Sword</i>: “Watch your step when wandering areas oceans once covered. What looks like a stone could be this Pokémon, and it will curse you if you kick it.”)</p>
      <p>It’s a huge bummer! Regular Corsola is spritely and chipper, while Galarian Corsola is cursed and forlorn, bleached white and evoking <a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/3/30/11332636/great-barrier-reef-coral-bleaching">calamitous, real-world coral bleaching</a>. If this doesn’t put the fear of climate change into you, <a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/4/18/15272634/catastrophic-coral-bleaching-great-barrier-reef-map">what will</a>?</p>
      <p>Incidentally, Galarian Corsola evolves into a form that’s just as terrifying to look at as it is sad. Behold Cursola:</p>

      <p>And be warned; Cursola will have her revenge: “Be cautious of the ectoplasmic body surrounding its soul,” the Pokédex says. “You’ll become stiff as stone if you touch it.”</p>
      <p>Of course, Corsola isn’t the only Pokémon that adapted to Galar’s pollution problems over the years. The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon/2019/8/7/20758508/pokemon-sword-shield-galar-forms-weezing-fanart-bong">bong-esque</a> Galarian Weezing, with its smokestack top hats, adapted to the region’s filthy air to became something different from its original poison-type counterpart.</p>
      <p>“Long ago, during a time when droves of factories fouled the air with pollution, Weezing changed into this form for some reason,” reads <i>Pokémon Shield</i>’s dex entry for Galarian Weezing, while <i>Sword</i> notes, “This Pokémon consumes particles that contaminate the air. Instead of leaving droppings, it expels clean air.”</p>
      <p>Thank you for being a force for positive change, Galarian Weezing. We need some good news right now.</p>
