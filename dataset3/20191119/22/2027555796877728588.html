      <p>By planting different lies, the BJP has been trying to make people emotional. But, the Congress party will fight against the mean political games of BJP, said KPCC President Dinesh Gundu Rao.</p>
      <p>Speaking during the birth anniversary of former prime minister Indira Gandhi and the installation ceremony of the new District Congress Committee office bearers, at Vokkaligara Samudaya Bhavan in Chikkamagaluru on Tuesday, he accused the BJP of misleading the people.</p>
      <p>He said that the Modi government was not able to bring ‘Acche Din’ so far. It has failed to fulfil the promises.</p>
      <p>He further said, “It is true that the Congress party is in a bad position in Udupi, Dakshina Kannada, Chikkamagaluru and Shivamogga districts. But, Congress does not play with the emotions of people, as BJP.”</p>
      <p>He wanted to know why the attacks by IT and ED are not happening on BJP leaders’ houses.</p>
      <p>“The BJP’s Hippocratic stand on the disqualified MLAs is no more a secret,” he said.</p>
      <p>He accused that the Central and the state governments have failed to compensate flood victims in the state.</p>
      <p>The KPCC president meanwhile called upon the new office bearers of the district Congress Committee to strengthen the party from the booth level.</p>
      <p>“There are a lot of expectations from the new District Congress Committee President DR K P Amshumanth,” he added.</p>
      <p>Congress leaders Siddaramaiah, B L Shankar, S L Patil, Vishnunathan, U T Khader, Vinay Kumar Sorake, Sachin Meega, T H Shivashankarappa, G H Srinivas, T D Rajegowda, Motamma, B L Ramadas, D K Taradevi, Gayatri Shantegowda and others were present.</p>
