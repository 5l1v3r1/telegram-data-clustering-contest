      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/roman-kemp/">Roman Kemp</a> did the most hilarious impression of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ant-mcpartlin/">Ant McPartlin</a> and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/declan-donnelly/">Declan Donnelly</a> on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a>…Get Me Out Of Here – and it’s safe to say it was just ‘great’.</p>
      <p>As the campmates gathered around to eat, they cheered on a large lizard who was trying to climb a slope.</p>
      <p>The celebrities then got to know each other’s weird and wonderful hidden talents which started by Myles Stephenson beatboxing, Jacqueline Jossa then joined in by making the most realistic-sounding baby crying noises.</p>
      <p>Andrew Maxwell then made a didgeridoo sound which had the whole camp in stitches.</p>
      <p>But, it got better because Roman Kemp decided to do his best impression of Dec.</p>
      <p>‘Ok Ant don’t forget to dial, 09020 and for Ian add 04,’ he laughed.</p>

      <p>The radio DJ then did his best impression of Ant when he watches the campers do a bushtucker trial.</p>

      <p>‘You’re doing great, you’re doing great,’ Roman said as he flipped his head back and forth (which we must admit was brilliant).</p>
      <p>Taking it in good jest, Ant and Dec show they can always laugh at themselves at Ant responded: ‘That sounded absolutely nothing like us.’</p>

      <p>The comedy duo were on top form on Tuesday night as they also couldn’t help but make <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/im-celebritys-ant-dec-make-dig-prime-minister-johnson-corbyn-clash-live-tv-11184734/">light of the debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn on the live TV debate.</a></p>
      <p>‘Two camps are about to become one, but first there’s work to be done,’ Ant said as he introduced I’m A Celeb.</p>
      <p>‘Which means five of them are about to face their deepest fears,’ Dec continued.</p>
      <p>Ant joked: ‘Welcome to Australia and another TV show where two men like the sound of their own voices.’</p>
      <p>‘Evening Prime Minister…for now,’ Dec laughed.</p>
      <p>Ant then interrupted as he listened into his ear piece, he continued: ‘Hang on, hang on, I am just hearing that even this show must remain politically impartial.’</p>
      <p>Dec responded: ‘You’re right, good evening Prime Minister for now, and good evening bloke who wants to be Prime Minister, although why anyone who would want that job is beyond me.’</p>

      <p>The jokers continued as Ant said: ‘Caitlin proved there’s nothing worse than someone going on and on and on and not listening to a word you say.’</p>
      <p>Dec interjected: ‘Again evening Prime Minister and bloke who wants to be Prime Minister.’</p>
