      <p>The Archeological Survey of India (ASI) may soon commission a building to house museum at Halebeed, Belur taluk, Hassan district.</p>
      <p>A proposal for the museum building has been pending for the two decades.</p>
      <p>“Precious collection of artefacts and exhibits at the open sky museum need better conservation. The museum will be tourist-friendly if the exhibits are housed inside. An exclusive building for the museum boost tourism and helps conserve the exhibits,” Superintending Archeologist Shivakant Bajpai told DH on sidelines of the inauguration of the World Heritage Week at Dariya Daulat Bagh on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>As the old proposal would not suit contemporary needs, a fresh proposal would be submitted to higher-ups to commission a museum, Bajpai said.</p>
      <p>He said he would write letter to the Commissioner of State Muzrai department to keep doors of temples protected by the ASI open during the day.</p>
      <p>The Muzrai department takes care of rituals at some temples managed by the ASI.</p>
      <p>“The Sri Ranganathaswamy temple in Srirangapatna managed by the ASI remains closed between 12 noon and 4 pm.</p>
      <p>The ASI is not opposed to closure of the sanctum sanctorum, but the main entrance itself is closed during that time,” he said. </p>
      <p>Closure of the temple does not facilitate tourists to enjoy sculptural and architectural beauty of the temple.</p>
      <p>Hence, a letter would be written requesting the Muzrai department to keep the temple open throughout the day, he added.</p>
