      <h1>Why Carmelo Anthony is wearing 00 jersey for the Trail Blazers, and not 7</h1>

      <p>Carmelo Anthony officially joined the Trail Blazers on Tuesday, and he'll be wearing a new jersey number: 00.</p>

      <p>Anthony's choice of 00 may have confused those who are familiar with the NBA player's number history. After all, Anthony has branded "#StayMe7o" based on the fact he wore No. 7 throughout most of his career. But even when he didn't wear 7, he's had other numbers.</p>
      <p>There are reasons why Anthony wasn't able to wear any of his previous numbers ...</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>No. 7:</b> While not technically retired in Portland, it is reportedly being withheld in honor of Brandon Roy.</li>
        <li><b>No. 15:</b> The number Melo wore in Denver and Syracuse is retired for Larry Steele.</li>
        <li><b>No. 22:</b> Melo's high school number at Oak Hill is retired for Clyde Drexler.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>So this brings up ...</p>
      <h3>Why is Carmelo Anthony wearing 00?</h3>
      <p>We'll let him explain it.</p>

      <p>Make sense? No? Welcome to the club.</p>
      <p>Anthony's post doesn't make a ton of sense, but it's the best answer we have as to why he chose 00. It is a little odd the Trail Blazers will have one player wearing 00 (Anthony) and another just wearing 0 (Damian Lillard), but that's where we're at now.</p>
