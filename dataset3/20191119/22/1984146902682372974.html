      <h1>Brandon Taylor the one positive as Sunderland's struggles in the final third reach new lows</h1>
      <h2>Sunderland lost 1-0 at Gillingham in the FA Cup first round replay</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T22:49:41+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 22:49</time> by <a rel="author">Craig Johns</a></address>
      <p>Sunderland limped out of the FA Cup, losing their first-round replay at Gillingham 1-0 having failed to muster a single effort on target.</p>
      <p>Gillingham needed extra time in a dull game of football, but Brandon Hanlan’s 115th minute strike was ultimately enough to send <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland-afc">the Black Cats</a> out and leave Phil Parkinson with continued concerns about his side, particularly in the final third.</p>
      <p>Here’s the game at a glance.</p>
      <h3>The goal</h3>
      <p>GOAL: Gillingham 1-0, Hanlan - Ball breaks kindly for Hanlan just to the right of the edge of the box and he smashes it low across goal into the bottom corner. Deadlock finally broken with the first shot on target.</p>
      <h3>The tactics</h3>
      <p>For just the second time in Parkinson’s reign, Sunderland went with three at the back for the FA Cup replay at Gillingham. With Jordan Willis and Joel Lynch both out injured and Tom Flanagan away on international duty, young Brandon Taylor was needed for a starting spot. That was what most likely prompted the switch at the back - offering more protection for the young defender.</p>

      <p>Approach-wise it was very direct from Sunderland - more in line with what we were told to expect from Parkinson from fans of the previous clubs he’d managed.</p>
      <p>It was far from pleasing on the eye, nor effective. With Will Grigg and Duncan Watmore up front, the ball just constantly kept coming back and Sunderland cleared their lines but continuously missed out the midfield. Neither Grigg or Watmore are suited to being target men, but neither helped themselves in this game either, hardly making a Gillingham defender work once.</p>
      <h3>The game-changing moment</h3>
      <p>In one of the dullest games in history, the 90 minutes dragged as neither side managed a shot on target. It was a dreadful game, and another dreadful Sunderland performance.</p>
      <p>In the 12th minute of extra time though, the hosts came closest of any side at that point to breaking the deadlock. Captain Max Ehmer smashed the ball on the half volley off the bar. It was the first real moment of any quality in the game.</p>
      <p>While hitting the woodwork still didn’t count as a shot on target, what it did do was buoy the home side. Their belief grew.</p>
      <p>And just moments after Alfie Jones fired another chance over, Hanlan scored the only goal of the game to send the Gills into the second round.</p>
      <h3>The rookie... And the stand-out performance</h3>
      <p>Initially these were meant to be two separate topics.</p>
      <p>With Brandon Taylor making just his second start the intention had been to take a close look at him, while also naming a stand-out performer.</p>
      <p>That the 20-year-old was the stand-out performer says a lot about his great evening - and Sunderland’s rather poor one.</p>
      <p>Taylor showed no signs of looking out of place. He read the game well throughout, and more than held his own in a couple of tussles.</p>

      <p>On the ball, he looked very good too, and got more than one thumbs up from his manager for a couple of balls knocked forward.</p>
      <p>As was the case in the first leg at the Stadium of Light, Brandon Hanlan looked a bright spark for the home side and he once managed to out-muscle the young defender, but Taylor’s battling was enough to not allow him any balance as he glanced a header wide.</p>
      <p>Going forward, his size could be an issue. He’s very small for a centre-back and, with no Mikael Mandron in this one, Gillingham did not have a forward to exploit that. But against other sides in this league it could be an issue. Credit where it’s due though, he won more than his fair share of headers in this one, and bravely threw himself into every 50-50 challenge and block and looked one of few players in red and white up for the fight.</p>
      <p>Without his brave block as he threw himself in front of a close-range shot in the 93rd minute we wouldn’t have even had extra time - not that we should thank him for having to watch another 30 minutes of that!</p>
      <h3>The positive to take</h3>
      <p>Another night of very few positives to take for Sunderland.</p>
      <p>The 329 supporters who made the trip to Kent on a cold Tuesday night in November deserve a huge shout-out, as does Taylor, for everything noted above.</p>
      <p>The only other positive from another terrible evening is that we’re now one step closer to January 1 when Phil Parkinson can, and will absolutely have to strengthen his squad. That’s not so much a positive of this game, but more just the natural passing of time, which sums up just how bad this game was.</p>
      <h3>The negative</h3>
      <p>Another game, another dull Sunderland performance.</p>
      <p>Right now they just have absolutely no spark in the final third and are struggling to create much.</p>
      <p>This was the first time Phil Parkinson had a full week to work with his players in between games, but he still hasn’t managed to solve the issues up top. Between Grigg, Maguire, Watmore and McGeady, not one had even a decent game.</p>

      <p>The midfield were missed out so often as Sunderland went direct. Trouble was, the ball just kept coming back as the forward two just failed to offer up any fight for the loose balls.</p>
      <h3>The verdict</h3>
      <p>Sunderland are out of the FA Cup and this was as dull as dull gets. Sunderland didn’t create a meaningful chance until the 71st minute of the game when Grigg fired wide on his weaker left foot. Gillingham tried a little more but lacked quality to have any conviction.</p>
      <p>For Parkinson The same issues with his forward players persists and right now you have to think he’s praying he can fast-forward to January to get reinforcements.</p>
      <p>In truth, this game and this competition matter little, but the least the travelling fans should expect is a performance with effort. They didn’t get it here.</p>
