      <p>Speaking at the Code Media conference in Los Angeles, Kerry Ehrin and Mimi Leder <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/19/20973037/morning-show-reviews-executive-producers-apple-attack-codemedia">responded to questions</a> about "The Morning Show's" middling reviews, saying they believe critics were conflating thoughts on the series with perspectives on Apple TV+ as a service, reports <i>The Verge</i>.<br/><br/>"When those reviews came in, I didn't know what show they were watching," Leder said. "I thought they were nuts. I thought there were a lot of Apple haters who just wanted Apple to fail. The reviews felt like an attack on Apple."<br/><br/>Both Ehrin and Leder believe critics took the review as an opportunity to provide commentary on Apple TV+ instead of focusing on the subject at hand, a process Leder said is "not fair." While not scathing, reviews for "The Morning Show" were less than rosy and far from glowing. <br/><br/>"When you see reviews, they're looking at it from the whole business aspect, [like] what is Apple doing?,'" Ehrin said. "It's kind of separate from us."<br/><br/><i>AppleInsider</i> <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/10/28/apple-tv-review-dont-wake-up-for-the-morning-show-just-yet">reviewed "The Morning Show"</a> and found that, while it boasts excellent acting and directing, the show lacked a clear voice in its early episodes. That could change as the series develops.<br/><br/>Despite a slightly below average aggregate score from professional critics, "The Morning Show" appears well-received by consumers. <i>The Verge</i> points to a Rotten Tomatoes average viewer score of 95%, much higher than the 63% average from media outlets and independent analysts.<br/><br/>"People love it, and we love it," Ehrin said. "That's what matters."<br/><br/>As previously reported, Apple is not sharing performance metrics with original series producers, but Ehrin and Leder said executives are "very happy about them."<br/><br/>Earlier this month a report from <i>Variety</i> claimed Apple TV+ <a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/11/07/apple-tv-reportedly-attracts-millions-of-users-in-first-week-as-apple-renews-four-shows">drew "millions" of users</a> in its first week of availability, many of whom average more than an hour on the service per session. A breakdown of viewer numbers has yet to see release, but early statistics show most users who sample one of Apple's four core shows — "<a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/10/28/apple-tv-review-dickinson-may-emerge-as-apples-signature-show">Dickinson</a>," "<a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/10/28/review-for-all-mankind-is-apple-tvs-most-captivating-new-series">For All Mankind</a>," "<a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/10/28/apple-tv-review-dont-wake-up-for-the-morning-show-just-yet">The Morning Show</a>" and "<a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/19/10/28/apple-tv-review-see-is-no-game-of-thrones">See</a>" — watch at least two episodes. <br/><br/>Apple is apparently pleased with the debut performance of "The Morning Show" and its other three marquee series, as it ordered second seasons of each.</p>
