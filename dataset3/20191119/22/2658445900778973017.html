      <p>LAGOS Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu on Tuesday kicked off Exercise Crocodile Smile IV with a charge to security agencies to flush pipeline vandals, pirates, kidnappers and armed robbers out of the state.</p>
      <p>He declared the exercise open shortly after watching a beach landing and counter terrorism simulation at the Takwa Bay Island in Iru-Victoria Island Local Council Development Area (LCDA).</p>
      <p>Sanwo-Olu, who was represented by his deputy Dr Obafemi Hamzat, expressed concerns over the increase in pipeline vandalism recalling a recent incident at Abesan Estate in the Ipaja area of Lagos state which could have been disastrous but for timely intervention of the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency (LASEMA).</p>
      <p>According to him, Exercise Crocodile Smile IV was a welcome development because it would check criminal-minded individuals out to make quick money before the festivities.</p>
      <p>The Nation reports that the exercise which was introduced by the Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Lt.-Gen. Tukur Buratai would serve both training and operational purposes for all security agencies participating as equipment and personnel have been put on standby to act real time, on any intelligence gathered.</p>
      <p>Sanwo-Olu said he was optimistic the exercise would ensure peace and security in the state during the yuletide, appealing to residents to cooperate with security agencies.</p>

      <p>The governor assured of the state’s commitment to provide needed support to the military, recalling the donation of 120 patrol vehicles and 35 motorcycles to security during his 100 days in office celebration.</p>
      <p>“On our part as a government, we will continue to make efforts to support the military to provide security in Lagos state as much as possible.</p>
      <p>“We doff our hats to your resilience and determination towards providing security in Lagos State despite difficult challenges. We applaud the responsiveness of the 9 Brigade of the Nigerian at clampping down on erring personnel of the military for disciplinary procedures whenever we find personnel defaulting on our laws.</p>
      <p>“With Exercise Crocodile Smile IV coming onboard in the run up to Christmas and beyond, the prospects are very bright that Lagosians and I believe the good people of Ogun State will enjoy a hitch-free 2019/2020 yuletide season.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Lt-Gen. Buratai said the exercise would be conducted simultaneously at 2, 6, 81 and 82 Divisions covering the south and southwest regions.</p>
      <p>Represented by the General Officer Commanding (GOC) 81 Division Maj.-Gen  Olu Irefin, Buratai said the exercise was aimed at reassuring all law-abiding citizens and the public of the army’s commitment to their security and safety.</p>
      <p>The exercise will be based on the Nigerian Army (NA) Super Camp Concept and will involve civil-military (CIMIC) activities as well as media operations.</p>
