      <p>Well, if you are using the Windows 10 operating system for a while, then you might be well aware of the Action Center. Action Center is just like a Notification Panel on Android which acts as a central location for all your notifications to Windows. Before Windows 10, there was no Action Center.</p>
      <p>With the 2016’s Anniversary Update of Windows 10, Microsoft has introduced a lot of changes to the Action Center like you can easily dismiss a group of notifications, reply to messaging services directly, prioritize apps, etc. Out of all those, the Notification Priorities are the most noticeable one as it ensures that the notifications from your most-used apps are not buried deep down in the Action Center.</p>
