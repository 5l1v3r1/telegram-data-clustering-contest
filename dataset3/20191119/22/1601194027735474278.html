      <p><b>NEW YORK</b> <i>(November 16, 2019)</i> – Major League Soccer today released the list of 222 players available for selection in the 2019 MLS Expansion Draft. Expansion clubs Nashville SC and Inter Miami CF will continue to build their inaugural rosters by selecting up to five players each from the eligible player list on Tuesday, Nov. 19.</p>
      <p>Kicking off at 5:30 p.m. ET, MLSsoccer.com’s 2019 MLS Expansion Draft live studio show will bring fans all of the selections in real-time, providing expert analysis on each team’s picks. In addition, MLSsoccer.com host Susannah Collins will be on location in the swankiest honky tonk <i>Ole Red® Nashville</i>, bringing live updates from the Nashville SC fan event that will feature local celebrities announcing Nashville SC’s Expansion Draft picks and live musical performances. In Miami, reporter Jillian Sakovits will be fully embedded with Inter Miami CF to provide breaking news straight from club headquarters.</p>
      <p>The Expansion Draft eligible player list includes players from 19 MLS clubs. D.C. United, FC Dallas, the Houston Dynamo, New York Red Bulls, and Vancouver Whitecaps FC are exempt, having had a player selected in the 2018 MLS Expansion Draft.</p>
      <p>All 19 remaining clubs had the opportunity to protect up to 12 players each from their roster. MLS Homegrown Players ages 25 and under (those born during or after 1994), as well as Generation adidas players that did not graduate from the program following the 2019 season are automatically protected, therefore clubs did not need to use one of their 12 selections to protect them.</p>
      <p>Once a player has been claimed from a club's list of eligible players, Nashville SC and Inter Miami may no longer select players from that club's list.</p>
