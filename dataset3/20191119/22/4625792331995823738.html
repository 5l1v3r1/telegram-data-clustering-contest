      <h1>Ilhan Omar asks judge to go easy on man who pleaded guilty to threatening to kill her</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T22:31:23+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 22:31</time> by <a rel="author">Caitlin Yilek</a></address>
      <p>Rep. Ilhan Omar urged a judge for leniency in sentencing a New York man who threatened to kill her.</p>
      <p>The Minnesota Democrat wrote a letter on Tuesday to U.S. District Court Judge Frank Geraci asking for “compassion to be applied” in Patrick Carlineo’s sentencing.</p>
      <p>Carlineo, 55, pleaded guilty Monday to calling Omar's office on March 21, telling a staffer that Omar was a “terrorist,” and <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/new-york-man-charged-with-threatening-to-kill-ilhan-omar">threatening to shoot her</a>. He faces up to 10 years in prison.</p>
      <p>He told the FBI he loved President Trump and hates people he believes are radical Muslims in the United States government, according to the criminal complaint.</p>
      <p>“He has taken responsibility for using threatening and inappropriate language to express those beliefs in this instance,” Carlineo’s lawyer, Sonya Zoghlin, <a href="http://www.startribune.com/ny-man-admits-threatening-to-kill-rep-omar-of-minn/565124022/?refresh=true">told the <i>Star Tribune</i></a>, adding that her client never intended to harm Omar and never made any plans to do so.</p>
      <p>His plea included the admission that he illegally had guns. A 1998 felony criminal mischief conviction prohibited him from possessing guns, prosecutors said.</p>
      <p>“There is no doubt that Mr. Carlineo’s crime is grave,” Omar wrote in the two-page letter.</p>
      <p>“But we must ask: who are we as a nation if we respond to threats of political retribution with retribution ourselves?” she said. “Punishing the defendant with a lengthy prison sentence or a burdensome financial fine would not rehabilitate him. It would not repair the harm he has caused. It would only increase his anger and resentment.”</p>
      <p>Omar said Carlineo should be given a chance “to make amends and seek redemption.”</p>

      <p>Omar has faced criticism from Trump and others, who have accused her of being anti-Semitic for statements she has made about Israel. In 2012, Omar tweeted that<b> </b>Israel had “hypnotized the world” to hide its “evil doings.” This year she came under fire for saying U.S. politicians only support Israel because of financial support.</p>
      <p>The Somali American representative was part of a group of four Democratic congresswomen Trump said should “<a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trump-advises-progressive-democrat-congresswomen-go-back-to-where-they-came-from">go back</a>” to their home countries, though only Omar was born outside the U.S.</p>
