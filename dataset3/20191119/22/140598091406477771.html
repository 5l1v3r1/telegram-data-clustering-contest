      <h1>Joe Root says Jofra Archer can be England's biggest weapon on flat pitch for first Test</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T22:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 22:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/scyld-berry/" target="_blank">Scyld Berry</a></address>
      <p>For England’s Test captain Joe Root, this two-Test series against New Zealand with his new head coach Chris Silverwood is a “fresh start” in solving a complex problem, and although it is not part of the World Test Championship, that does not matter.</p>
      <p>If England’s previous head coach Trevor Bayliss was a benign uncle, Silverwood is more like Root’s older brother — more hands-on, proactive and structured, more prepared than Bayliss to do the talking in the dressing-room before and after play. And whereas Bayliss was a batsman for New South Wales, Silverwood was a fast bowler for Yorkshire, Middlesex and England, and perhaps better positioned to solve this complex problem: how to dismiss Australia — Steve Smith and all — in 2021-22 for less than 400 a time.</p>
      <p>“We’re aligned on how we want to move forward,” Root said. He and Silverwood want to “utilise these 25 Tests within that period to make sure [when] we go to Australia, we feel we have all bases covered and are in the best possible shape to win there. It’s married up nicely with him coming in as coach and does give that fresh feel, fresh start to the next couple of years.</p>
      <p>“Before August none of the Tests were for the [World Test] Championship, and they all seemed to mean something,” Root said. “One thing it is, is a chance to grow in these conditions on maybe some flatter wickets ahead of South Africa and maybe Australia down the line. And how are we going to approach those conditions, bat for long periods of time to set the game up in the first innings, and can we find different ways of <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cricket/2019/11/15/scyld-berrys-verdict-england-stumble-upon-familiar-problem/">using that flat surface to our advantage</a> and take wickets.</p>
      <p>“In this part of the world, if things get flat, you can’t just roll the dice and gamble. You’ve got to be prepared to be patient and sit in for long periods of time, and build pressure in different ways. And that will be a new challenge for this group, not something we’ve done a huge amount of over the last two or three years. But if we want to get better and more consistent around the world, and win more frequently away from home, that’s an area we’re going to have get good at and better at, and this is our first opportunity.”</p>
      <p>New Zealand, unbeaten at home over their past nine Tests, stand second in the ICC Test rankings, England third. Root’s Test record is by no means as bad as some might think. Like most England captains, he has won slightly more Tests than he has lost: 16 to 13. The question is whether England are making the most of their resources, which are — however defined — only really exceeded by India’s.</p>
      <p>At least in this series England will be forewarned. The most recent time they started a Test series in New Zealand, at Eden Park in Auckland in a day/night Test, their score was soon 27 for nine because Trent Boult swung the pink ball. It was arguably <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cricket/2018/03/22/humiliation-new-zealand-england-bowled-58-their-sixth-lowest/">England’s most nightmarish start to any Test</a>.</p>
      <p>The first Test pitch is predicted to offer more pace — on the basis of the last Plunket Shield game — and the second, at Hamilton, more lateral movement. New Zealand might go for the extra pace of Lockie Ferguson, in place of the veteran swinger Tim Southee, to counter that of Jofra Archer.</p>

      <p>In the warm-up games at Whangarei Archer did not behave remotely like a superstar, though he would have had some justification to feel like one <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/cricket/2019/10/14/jofra-archer-interview-think-england-can-make-history-have/">after his bowling in the World Cup</a>, most notably the super over in the final, and against Australia. In his four Ashes Tests he was instrumental in winning two, at Headingley and the Oval, where he took six wickets in an innings at both venues. The only one of the four Tests where Archer played and England lost was at Old Trafford, where he seemed to find the biting gale too much for fast bowling on the first two days.</p>
      <p>Already it is apparent that Archer is a bowler, not of many moods but gears, yet his run-up remains the same. At Whangarei, after a month’s lay-off, he began in first and moved up to fourth by the end, though even then his bouncers hit Jos Buttler’s gloves with a resounding thwack.</p>
      <p>When he fielded and batted at Whangarei, Archer never affected the mannerisms of a superstar but those of a player brought up in the best traditions of Barbadian cricket. When non-striker, he ran hard when occasion demanded. If he tossed the ball to a fielder inaccurately he would run to pick it up. He likes the quiet life — no golf on the day off for him or the two Bolton lads, Saqib Mahmood and Matt Parkinson — and any fast bowler is entitled to that.</p>
      <p>Stuart Broad can pitch the new ball up at New Zealand’s opening pair of left-handers, Sam Curran can benefit from the cross-breeze and Ben Stokes bowl short, sharp bursts, while Jack Leach keeps the run-rate down. But it is Archer who can take wickets in clusters, and harry the opposition’s best batsman, like Steve Smith at Lord’s, and Kane Williamson the New Zealand captain.</p>
      <p>“Knowing Jofra, he wants to see the ball moving sideways,” Root said. “But one thing he underestimates is his own talent sometimes and that pace through the air can be a quite a big skill on its own. He makes it look ridiculously easy with his action and the way he approaches the crease, the nature of his style … but to be able to bowl at that pace for a period of time is a skill in itself and I think he needs to understand that.</p>
      <p>“One thing I have learned is that he has a huge hunger for wickets, he wants to be in the game and once you get the ball in his hand and he feels like he has something to offer, a bit like Jimmy [Anderson] he can be very hard to get it off. It’s a great trait to have and over this next period it’s trying to manage that carefully, sensibly, to get the most out of him in that moment, but also the longevity of a young man’s career who has that ability to change a game. You want him to bowl as many spells as possible over 90mph, not one a series or once in a blue moon.”</p>
      <p>Even though the World Test Championship began last summer, with the Ashes as the inaugural series, this series is not going to be part of it. The ICC’s new system would be too simple and comprehensible if every major Test-playing country were to play the others, to see which two went through to the final. Besides, the Indian government would not allow their team to play Pakistan.</p>
      <p>So countries pick and choose whom they want to play — and if you want to reach the World Test Championship final, the first thing you do is arrange a home Test series against Bangladesh. That is 120 points in the bag, or as certain as anything is in cricket. England have not, of course, arranged to play Bangladesh in the two-year cycle leading to the final.</p>
      <p>But the main objection to the World Test Championship, in its inaugural phase, is that the majority of Test series consist of two Tests. Nothing so reduces the importance of Test cricket as playing a two-Test series. It proclaims: this series is so unimportant that it is only going to consist of two matches. A team flies in for a fortnight. Who cares?</p>
      <p>Instead of playing one two-Test series in New Zealand last year, and another now, it would have been far more interesting to stage a four-Test series. Any Test match makes a loss for NZ Cricket, because the crowds are so small, the costs so high. But a four-Test series would attract several thousand England supporters, not simply a few hundred, who would set aside a month or more for that once-in-a-lifetime trip to New Zealand and pump tens of millions of dollars into the economy. Fascinating cricket too, between two well-matched sides, in a variety of conditions.</p>
