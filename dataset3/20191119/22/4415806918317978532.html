      <p>Roman Kemp has butted heads with Adele Roberts over her decision to bring a framed photo of Jane McDonald into I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out of Here! as a luxury item.</p>
      <p>Kemp, 26, the son of Spandau Ballet star Martin Kemp, teased Radio 1 DJ Roberts, 40, about her choice on Tuesday night’s episode of the ITV show.</p>
      <p>The pair clashed after Capital FM DJ Kemp challenged members of the camp in Australia to name one of McDonald’s songs before lampooning Roberts’s decision as “just random”.</p>

      <p>Singer McDonald, 56, shot to fame on fly-on-the-wall TV series The Cruise.</p>
      <p>Good Morning Britain presenter Kate Garraway also challenged the camp to name one of the singer’s tracks, adding: “Jane McDonald is looking over us. Can you think of a song of hers?”</p>
      <p>Roberts said: “I know her off Loose Women. I don’t know her actual songs but I know her from the cruising show when she does covers.”</p>
      <p>Kemp and Rak-Su member Myles Stephenson laughed and both said: “No one knows what she does,” before Garraway replied: “She’s a legend.”</p>
      <p>After a tense back-and-forth, Kemp said: “It’s just random, mate.”</p>

      <p>An irritated Roberts finally told him: “That’s prejudice. I’m allowed to like what I want.”</p>
      <p>Realising he had made her angry, Kemp apologised, saying: “I wasn’t saying that at all. I’m sorry – I didn’t mean to.”</p>
      <p>Roberts then said: “It’s like you’re saying: ‘Why would I like Jane McDonald?’</p>
      <p>“I’m not allowed to like what I want?”</p>
      <p>Kemp managed to defuse the situation, saying: “I like the picture being there,” before giving Roberts a hug.</p>

      <p>The episode also saw those living in the Snake Rock camp – including Caitlyn Jenner and Ian Wright – take part in a Bushtucker Trial called Face Your Fears in which they wore clear helmets filled with insects and rats.</p>
      <p>The celebrities were challenged with releasing two stars in two minutes using the tools provided.</p>
      <p>After the challenge, Snake Rock and the Main Camp finally came together for good.</p>
      <p>Nadine Coyle also offered an insight into her life in Girls Aloud.</p>
      <p>Asked by Garraway why she was not still friends with the other members of the group, Coyle said: “Everyone gets on with their lives. I was friends with them all. It was all nice and lovely.</p>
      <p>“But I was always in the gay bars with all the guys. I would be out partying – me and 10 guys. I was having a laugh. I was 18 to 19 years old.”</p>
      <p>I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here! continues on ITV.</p>
