      <p>Manchester City brought in a record £535.2 million last season, the club’s 2018-19 annual report stated.</p>
      <p>It was City’s 11th successive year of revenue growth and closes the gap on local rivals Manchester United, the Premier League’s richest club.</p>
      <p>The figure is projected to rise again next year given City have already qualified for the knockout stages of the Champions League.</p>
      <p>Payments from a £45 million-a-year Puma kit deal will also start to take effect.</p>
      <p>United have already said their turnover will fall to between £560 million and £580 million this year because of their failure to qualify for the Champions League.</p>
      <p>The period covers a campaign when City’s men’s and women’s teams won a combined six trophies, including a clean sweep of English domestic honours for Pep Guardiola’s side.</p>
      <p>“This outcome represents not just a season, but a decade of hard work,” said Blues chairman Khaldoon al-Mubarak. “The organisation is now at a level of maturity that allows us to plan in multi-year cycles.”</p>
      <p>City recorded a profit of £10.1 million and a wage/turnover ratio of 59 per cent.</p>
