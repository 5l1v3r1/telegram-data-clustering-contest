        <i>• Netherlands beat Estonia 5-0 in Group C<br/>• Benteke and De Bruyne give Belgium 6-1 win over Cyprus</i>
      </p>
      <p>Georginio Wijnaldum struck a hat-trick as <b>Netherlands</b>, who had already <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/19/wales-hungary-euro-2020-qualifier-match-report">booked a spot</a> at Euro 2020, eased to a 5-0 victory over <b>Estonia</b> in their final Group C qualifying clash at the Johan Cruyff Arena on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The home side were in complete control of the contest from early on, with the defender Nathan Ake and 18-year-old debutant Myron Boadu also among the goals, as they finished second in the standings with 19 points from eight games, two behind the group winners, Germany.</p>
      <p>Netherlands’ coach, Ronald Koeman, said before the game he would experiment with team selection and stuck to his word, with the livewire Quincy Promes converted to right-back, and the AZ Alkmaar forward Calvin Stengs, 20, handed a debut from the start.</p>
      <p>It took the home side six minutes to hit the front, as Promes was afforded far too much space on the right and his delivery was headed back across goal and into the net by Wijnaldum, who scored eight times in his seven matches in the qualifiers.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/holland">Netherlands</a> dominated possession and launched wave after wave of attacks. They were rewarded for their endeavour with a second goal as Ake headed in a cross from Memphis Depay.</p>
      <p>The Netherlands got their third when Stengs robbed the ball off Karol Mets and set up Wijnaldum for his second.</p>
      <p>Captain for the night, Wijnaldum then collected a pass from Stengs to complete his hat-trick, before the AZ forward Boadu came off the bench to net the fifth.</p>
      <p>Christian Benteke and Kevin De Bruyne scored two goals each as <b>Belgium </b>thrashed <b>Cyprus </b>6-1 in their Euro 2020 Group I qualifier at the King Baudouin Stadium.</p>
