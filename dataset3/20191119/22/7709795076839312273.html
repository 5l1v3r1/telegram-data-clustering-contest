        <b>Aaron Ramsey fired Wales to Euro 2020 as a 2-0 victory over Hungary in Cardiff sealed their place in next summer's finals.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ramsey, making his first Wales start in over a year after being dogged by injuries, scored in each half as Ryan Giggs' side leapfrogged Hungary into second spot in Group E.</p>
      <p>The Juventus midfielder headed Wales into a 15th-minute lead to settle the nerves of a capacity Cardiff City Stadium crowd.</p>
      <p>Ramsey's second just after the restart was his 16th international goal, taking him past the great John Charles on the all-time Wales scoring list and into joint-seventh place.</p>
      <p>Victory secured Wales' third appearance at a major tournament, coming just four years after their second when the Dragons reached the semi-finals of Euro 2016.</p>
