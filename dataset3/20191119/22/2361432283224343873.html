      <h1>Rep Eric Swalwell Denies Farting During Live MSNBC Interview: 'This Too Shall Pass'</h1>
      <h2>The MSNBC show’s Twitter account also denied the noise was a fart</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T22:25:37+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 22:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thewrap.com/author/lindsey-ellefson/" target="_blank">Lindsey Ellefson</a></address>
      <p>Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) denies that the sound heard by viewers of MSNBC’s “Hardball” on Monday night was, in fact, him farting.</p>
      <p>The show’s Twitter account put out a statement after Swalwell’s appearance Monday night claiming the noise, which was causing a stir online, was actually just host Chris Matthews’ mug scraping across the desk.</p>
      <p>“Sorry to disappoint the conspiracy theorists – it was the #hardball mug scraping across the desk. Get yours today and let’s get back to the news!” the account <a href="https://twitter.com/hardball/status/1196639020056494081?s=21">tweeted</a>, linking to an online shop where viewers could get a “Hardball” mug of their own.</p>

      <p>Swalwell, a Democrat from California, <a href="https://twitter.com/repswalwell/status/1196641189476421632?s=21">retweeted</a> that, adding his own declaration in the style of the president: “TOTAL EXONERATION!”</p>
      <p>Chrissy Teigen, like countless others who replied to the “Hardball” account or tweeted their own theories on the origin of the noise, wanted none of that.</p>

      <p>“No it’s a fart don’t ruin this,” the author wrote, which earned her a Tuesday morning <a href="https://twitter.com/repswalwell/status/1196761334559526914?s=21">response</a> from Swalwell: “This, too, shall pass…”</p>
      <p>As of Tuesday morning, #ShartGate and #FartGate were both trending nationally on Twitter.</p>
      <p>So much for the “Hardball” plea for the American public to “get back to the news.”</p>
