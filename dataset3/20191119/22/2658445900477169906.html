      <p>A 27-year-old businessman, Ebuka Okejeme, was on Tuesday arraigned in an Ikeja Chief Magistrates’ Court over alleged N33 million theft.</p>
      <p>Okejeme, whose address was not given, is standing trial on a two-count charge of conspiracy and stealing.</p>
      <p>The Prosecutor, ASP. Peter Nwangwu, told the court that the defendant committed the offences on October 21 at Aspanda Trade- fair Market, Amuwo Odofin area of Lagos.</p>
      <p>Nwangwu said that the defendant and some others still at large, defrauded one John Iloka of N33 million cash from a business transaction.</p>
      <p>“The defendant obtained the money from the complainant, but failed to keep to his own end of the business deal.</p>
      <p>“Okejeme converted the money to his personal use and absconded.</p>
      <p>“All efforts made by the complainant to get the defendant to refund the money proved abortive,” Nwangwu said.</p>
      <p>The prosecutor alleged that the defendant also stole auto bulbs, fan blades, wheel covers and vehicle accessories, valued at N20 million from the complainant.</p>
