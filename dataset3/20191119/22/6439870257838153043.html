      <p>ROBESON COUNTY, N.C. (WBTV) - A North Carolina man whose home suffered damage in both hurricanes Florence and Matthew is finally able to rebuild - and go to college - after scratching a N.C. Education Lottery ticket.</p>
      <p>Mark Hall Jr., of Rowland, N.C., bought the winning ticket Monday afternoon at the Sun-Do 711 store on N.C. 711 in Lumberton. He says he only plays the lottery “once in a blue moon” and usually buys the $1 tickets... but something told him to go higher.</p>
      <p>He bought a $5 “All About The Bens” ticket and went back to his van to begin scratching - but he wasn’t convinced he won at first.</p>
      <p>“I wasn’t sure what I won at first,” Hall told officials with the N.C. Education Lottery. “I showed my dad and said, ‘I think I won $200’. He looked at the ticket and told me that I needed to look at it again. That’s when I saw the $200,000. My head started spinning. I was speechless.”</p>
      <p>Hall claimed his prize Tuesday at lottery headquarters in Raleigh. After required state and federal tax withholdings, he’ll take home $141,501.</p>
      <p>“Thank you Jesus!” Hall said, putting his hands in the air and waving his check. “I feel so blessed right now. Thank you!”</p>
      <p>He plans to use his winnings to rebuild his home and live out his dream of going back to school.</p>
      <p>“The home I’m living in was damaged by both storms,” Hall told lottery officials. “We still have repairs to do. I’ll use some of the money for that, but I also want to use the money to go to school. I wasn’t able to go after I graduated high school, but now I can. I do landscaping and electrical work right now, but after I go back to school, I could open my own business. This is going to open up a whole new world for me.”</p>
