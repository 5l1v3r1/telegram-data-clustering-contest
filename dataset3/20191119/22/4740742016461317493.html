      <p>Graham Coughlan says Bristol Rovers' spirit is seeing them through games following another below-par performance against non-league Bromley in an FA Cup first round replay.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-rovers-fc">The Gas</a> won the game 1-0 thanks to Jonson Clarke-Harris' early goal but they struggled to put passes together and were under pressure for large periods.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-rovers-fc">Rovers' </a>recent performances have not set the world alight, but they are still proving hard to beat, and Coughlan credits this on the squad's desire to grind out results.</p>

      <p>He said: "I'm seeing massive heart, I'm seeing massive desire, I'm seeing massive character.</p>
      <p>"I'm seeing the boys going in the trenches week in, week out.</p>
      <p>"You're not going to play well every game, we've not played well for maybe the last two or three games, but we've progressed through to the next round of both cups.</p>
      <p>"I would take progress and into the next round of both cups over performances.</p>
      <p>"Performances thus far have been very good and have got us a point outside the play-offs and into the next round of the EFL Trophy and got us into the next round of the FA Cup.</p>
      <p>"We are getting there, slowly but surely. When we play well, we might not win a game, so let's just take the result, take the enjoyment and put a smile on our face.</p>
      <p>"I think that's only the second time this club has got to the second round in I think 11 years, one of the reporters said before the first Bromley game."</p>
