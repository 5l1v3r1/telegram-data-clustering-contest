      <h1>Wayne Pivac pledges to sharpen Wales’s attacking game</h1>

      </ul>
      <p>Wales start life without Warren Gatland at the end of the month when they face a Barbarians side coached by him in an uncapped match in Cardiff. His successor as head coach, Wayne Pivac, is a fellow New Zealander but one with a contrasting outlook on the game who has pledged to sharpen the side’s attack. He spent five seasons with the Scarlets.</p>
      <p>Gatland was appointed 12 years ago and in that time Wales won four Six Nations titles, three with a grand slam, and reached two World Cup semi-finals. Their style of play, dubbed Warrenball, was physical and based on an aggressive defence backed by a precise kicking game, but at times a lack of creativity cost them.</p>
      <p>“I want to evolve our game with the ball,” said Pivac after announcing a 35-man squad for the Barbarians which included the recently qualified New Zealanders Johnny McNicholl and Willis Halaholo among five uncapped players. “It will take time and I am looking forward to the challenge.</p>
      <p>“Wales enjoyed a successful period under Warren and the fact we think we can make improvements means we are heading in the right direction. We will be doing everything we can to emulate what Warren has achieved in terms of results and evolve at the same time. It is about having an all-court game that allows you to respond to different conditions.”</p>
      <p>Alun Wyn Jones will lead Wales in the defence of their Six Nations title in the new year but the second-row was not included in this month’s squad as he is nursing a thigh injury. Pivac is without the injured Jonathan Davies and Rhys Patchell as well.</p>
      <p>With Tomas Francis and Liam Williams, like Davies and Patchell, missing either some or all of the Six Nations, one of Pivac’s first tasks is to reboot Wales’s exiles programme and he has already watched Bristol where three potential recruits, Dan Thomas, Callum Sheedy and Ioan Lloyd play.</p>
      <p>“The exiles programme is under-utilised,” he said. “It is a matter of getting out there and having a look at players so that we can pick an exciting squad for the Six Nations. We are looking ahead to the 2023 World Cup and each squad we pick will have that in mind.”</p>
