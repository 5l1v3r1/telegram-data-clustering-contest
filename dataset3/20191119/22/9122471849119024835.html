      <h1>LSU Star’s NFL Draft Stock Is Reportedly Dropping</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T22:20:50+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 22:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/danlyons" target="_blank">Dan Lyons</a></address>
      <p>Entering the year, the LSU player that might’ve been getting the most attention wasn’t Joe Burrow or Clyde Edwards-Helaire, but safety Grant Delpit. The safety entered the 2019 season with <a href="https://thespun.com/college-football/espn-ranks-college-footballs-10-best-players-in-2019">serious hype</a>, but the LSU defense as a whole has been significantly overshadowed by the explosive offense.</p>
      <p>Burrow and company have taken serious pressure off of the LSU defense, and have the ability to score 40+ on just about anybody. That’s good, because the Tigers defense has looked very susceptible at times this year.</p>
      <p>It isn’t just Tua Tagovailoa’s Alabama or Sam Ehlinger’s Texas Longhorns offenses that have found success against Dave Aranda’s unit. Vanderbilt went for 38 points in a loss in September, and over the weekend Ed Orgeron’s old program Ole Miss dropped 37.</p>
      <p>Neither team came particularly close to a win, but LSU will need a more balanced effort if and when it plays a team like Ohio State or Clemson.</p>
      <p>Delpit, a potential early first rounder, has a hand in those struggles. The star safety has <i>really </i>struggled with missed tackles this year, and his among the national leaders in that unfortunate category.</p>
      <p>Per <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl-draft-2020-prospects-whose-stocks-are-headed-in-right-and-wrong-direction-183222198.html">Yahoo Sports</a>, it could affect his draft stock:</p>
      <blockquote>“Like with Benjamin, Delpit entered the season very high on our personal scouting list. His alley-to-alley range, coverage ability, toughness and intelligence all were roundly praised by observers coming into the season, and it appeared he could put himself in the top-10 discussion with a strong junior season.<br/><br/>For us, taking a safety in that range with the tackling concerns that Delpit has raised would be a giant risk and a potential reach. If an NFL team believe that his tackling problems this season — a whopping 19 this season, per PFF, which is tied for 10th most in the country among all defensive players. It’s been an issue since he missed a pair of big ones in the Texas game early on, but the concern only has grown. Delpit missed two or more tackles in seven of the eight games since then and had a brutal time at Bama, missing four tackles in that game.”</blockquote>
      <p>Yahoo’s Eric Edholm goes on to mention that Grant Delpit has <a href="https://thespun.com/sec/lsu/ed-orgeron-provides-injury-update-for-safety-grant-delpit">played through injury</a> at times this, which could play a part in those struggles. He believe that he will ultimately still go in the first round, but based on what he’s looked like this year, there’s some serious risk there.</p>
