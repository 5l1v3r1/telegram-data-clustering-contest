      <p>It's the luxury item that has, perhaps, raised a few eyebrows over the past 24 hours.</p>
      <p>On Monday night's episode of <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here</a>, viewers were left baffled at the choice of Adele Roberts' luxury item.</p>
      <p>The Radio 1 DJ opted for a little more unusual option than the most - a photograph of Loose Women star and cruise ship legend Jane McDonald.</p>
      <p>It was hoped the image would bring her luck during her stint in the jungle.</p>
      <p>But, on Tuesday night's episode, it appears a few people in the Main Camp are just as baffled as the viewers at home.</p>
      <p>In fact, things started to get a little heated when Roman commented on the Jane McDonald picture.</p>
      <p>Kate said: “Jane McDonald is looking over us, can you think of a song of hers?”</p>
      <p>“I know her off Loose Women, I don’t know her actual songs but I know her from the cruising show when she does covers," replied Adele.</p>
      <p>Myles and Roman laughed and said: “No one knows what she does.”</p>
      <p>Kate said: “She’s a legend.”</p>
      <p>This is where things started to take a little turn for the worse.</p>

      <p>"She’s a legend is she?" Roman said. "Name a song?”</p>
      <p>Kate couldn’t think of one, which led to some chuckling from Myles and Roman.</p>
      <p>Adele was then quick to reply, saying: “She’ll cruise around the world, for example she’d go to Iceland and then sing a Bjork or would go to the USA and sing Proud Mary.”</p>
      <p>Roman said: “It’s just random mate.”</p>
      <p>“Why though? I don’t understand," responded Adele.</p>
      <p>“How is it not random?” commented Roman.</p>
      <p>“But if I had brought in a picture of Ru-Paul would you have the same reaction?” asked Adele.</p>
      <p>Roman responded by saying he didn’t know and that he just thought it was random.</p>
      <p>Adele then hit back, saying: “That’s prejudice, I’m allowed to like what I want.”</p>
      <p>By this point, Roman had realised he'd started to wind her up a bit, and began to apoligise.</p>

      <p>“I wasn’t saying that at all," he said. "I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to.”</p>
      <p>Adele replied: “It’s like you’re saying ‘why would I like Jane McDonald?’”</p>
      <p>“Adele it’s not," he said. "The situation is funny.”</p>
      <p>Roman continued to apologise before Adele claimed: "It’s fine, you are just going on about it so much…”</p>
      <p>While Kate tried to explain it was just a bit of fun around the camp, Roman tried to end the conversation claiming he liked the picture being there.</p>
      <p>The Jane McDonald fuelled spat eventually ended with a hug.</p>
