      <p>A man has appeared in court accused of raping a young mum found dead in her <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/ayr">Ayr</a> home.</p>
      <p>Mum-of-two Kirsty Robertson was discovered at her home in Fulshaw Place in the Dalmilling area of the town in October.</p>
      <p>A 29-year-old man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, appeared on petition at <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/courts">Ayr Sheriff Court</a> and made no plea.</p>
      <p>He was released on bail.</p>
      <p>Detectives are still carrying out enquiries in relation to Kirsty's death which is still being treated as unexplained.</p>

      <p>A spokesman for Police Scotland said: "Police can confirm that a 29-year-old man has been arrested in connection with a serious sexual assault of a 29-year-old woman in Ayr."</p>
      <p>Forensic teams sealed off Kirsty’s house following her death but ruled out murder.</p>
      <p>Neighbours say police carried out a forensic sweep on the street and conducted door-to-door enquiries.</p>
      <p>Friend Samantha Hart launched a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/charity">JustGiving page</a> in the immediate aftermath of the mum-of-two's death to help pay for her funeral.</p>
      <p>She said: “Kirsty, as many people will know, was an absolute diamond of a girl and an amazing mum to her two kids who meant the world to her.</p>
      <p>“She had no immediate family, all she had was her two young kids, so I set this up for anyone to help so Kirsty can get the send off she deserves.</p>
