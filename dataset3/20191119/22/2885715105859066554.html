      <p>Thirteen years after he started pursuing a degree course in homeopathy from Bihar University and six years after he applied for registration to practice, the Maharashtra Council of Homeo-pathy (MCH) is yet to register a 53-year-old Mumbai resident as a homeopathy doctor. The Council has also refused to comply with Maharashtra State Human Rights Commission’s October 31 order, asking it to register the doctor.</p>
      <p>According to MCH, the course Borivali resident Devendra Pandey appeared for was in contravention to the syllabus prescribed by the Central Council of Homeopathy Act, 1973.</p>
      <p>Pandey had joined the course for Bachelor of Homeopathic Medicine and Surgery at Muzaff-arpur’s Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar (BRA) University in 2006. While for three years, no exams were held, within one-and-a-half years — between 2009 and 2010 — exams of both first and second-year students were held.</p>
      <p>In 2013, Pandey applied in MCH for registration, which was rejected. In 2015, he approached the National Human Rights Commission that transferred the case to the state commission.</p>
      <p>The MCH, when summoned by the commission, said that the course Pandey underwent was in contravention to syllabus prescribed by Central Council of Homeopathy Act. Instead of two years, Pandey had finished his first two exams within one-and-a-half years, it added. In his reply, Pandey said the delay in first exam was caused by the Bihar University.</p>
      <p>The MCH registrar also told the commission that between 2003 and 2006, more than 180 doctors who applied for registration from Bihar University had received fraudulent degree certificates. “A CID inquiry is going on in the case,” it said, adding that the MCH has become cautious as it had come across such degrees from Bihar universities, particularly BRA University.</p>
      <p>The commission noted that Pandey’s degree has been upheld by both the Bihar University and the Central Council of Homeo-pathy. In November 2018, the Central Council of Homeopathy wrote to Maharashtra government, asking it to register Bihar graduates while maintaining that it “recognises medical qualification” of both courses offered by Bihar University since 1991.</p>
      <p>While the commission, headed by M A Sayeed, asked the MCH to register Pandey within a month, the latter said that the four weeks will be exhausted by November end.</p>
      <p>With no end to his troubles, Pandey has now started pursuing a law degree. On Monday, he met Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari as a last ditch attempt to get the registration. “For the last few years, I have been relying on my wife’s earnings. She is a physiotherapist… For six years, I have been running to the Council’s office for registration,” he added.</p>
      <p>When contacted, MCH Registrar Dilip Bhuyar said: “We will not follow a one-judge bench’s order. The applicant gave two exams in one-and-a-half years for a degree course, which is against the rules.”</p>
