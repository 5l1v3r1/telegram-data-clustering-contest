      <h1>'This is immoral': Bernie Sanders tweets retracted Reuters story claiming US has 100,000 detained children</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T22:45:52+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 22:45</time> by <a rel="author">Zachary Halaschak</a></address>
      <p>Bernie Sanders tweeted out a Reuters story that linked to a story that had been retracted by the news organization because it cited statistics from almost five years ago.</p>
      <p>The independent Vermont senator and 2020 presidential candidate sent out <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-un-rights-child/us-has-worlds-highest-rate-of-children-in-detention-un-study-idUSKBN1XS1PC">the article</a> titled “U.S. has the world’s highest rate of children in detention: U.N. study” to his 8.8 million followers with the caption, “Under Trump, America leads the world in locking up little kids—including 100,000 children at the border. This is immoral.”</p>
      <p>The data was actually from 2015 when Barack Obama was president.</p>

      <p>The headline on the link remained intact, though when clicked, the article actually notes how the entire story had been retracted and bore a new headline, “Story on U.N. study on child detentions withdrawn.”</p>
      <p>The body text read, “A Nov. 18 story headlined ‘U.S. has world’s highest rate of children in detention - U.N. study’ is withdrawn. The United Nations issued a statement on Nov. 19, saying the number was not current but was for the year 2015. No replacement story will be issued.”</p>
      <p>Other news organizations, such as AFP, noted Tuesday on Twitter that the stories were being deleted.</p>
      <p>“The author of the report has clarified that his figures do not represent the number of children currently in migration-related US detention, but the total number of children in migration-related US detention in 2015,” AFP wrote. “We will delete the story.”</p>

      <p>Sanders, 78, supports loosening regulations on immigration. According to his <a href="https://feelthebern.org/bernie-sanders-on-immigration/">website</a>, he “opposes the immigration enforcement practices, known as the Zero Tolerance Policy, which are responsible for the separation of undocumented parents from their children at detention facilities near the Mexican border.”</p>
