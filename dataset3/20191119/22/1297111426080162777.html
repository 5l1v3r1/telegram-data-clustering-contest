      <p>Breaking news from the too-cheap-to-buy-a-card and too-lazy-to-think-of-a-different-intro departments: Happy 25th anniversary to my wife, Chryssoula Filippakopoulos.</p>
      <p>We celebrated our 20th anniversary on May 15.</p>
      <p>None of this is even remotely sensible.</p>
      <p>Please permit me to explain.</p>
      <p>It was Nov. 19, 1994. The Regina Pats were in Moose Jaw to play the Warriors at the Civic Centre — the Crushed Can. As the Regina Leader-Post’s hockey writer of the day, I was in The Friendly City (or whatever it is called now) to cover the spectacle.</p>
      <p>The buildup was a marketer’s dream. The night before, when the Pats and Warriors had met at the edifice formerly known as the Agridome, the opposing head coaches — Norm Johnston (Regina) and Al Tuer (Moose Jaw) — nearly came to blows between the benches.</p>
      <p>Those were the days when there was genuine enmity between the Pats and Warriors. The rivalry, barely detectable now, was at its apex.</p>
      <p>Hence the attendance — 3,317 — at the 2,969-seat Civic Centre, which was hardly the Civil Centre when the Pats were in town.</p>
      <p>Little did I know that one of the 3,317 attendees would change my life.</p>
      <p>After the game, won 5-2 by Moose Jaw, I ventured downstairs to interview interim head coach Bill Hicke (substituting for the suspended Johnston) and the Pats’ players.</p>
      <p>The visiting team’s dressing room was located downstairs near the Hot Stove Lounge, where the elite would meet and greet after each Warriors home game.</p>
      <p>While walking hurriedly down the hallway, I said hello to a friend, who was standing beside a special someone whom I had never met.</p>
      <p>This complete stranger smiled at me … and I died a little.</p>
      <p>I had never seen such a beautiful smile. (To this day, that has not changed. I write this at the not-inconsiderable risk of offending all the other avid smilers out there.)</p>
      <p>Somehow, I spluttered my way through the post-game interviews, whereupon I returned to my sprawling, 62-square-foot south Regina estate to confide in the dog.</p>
      <p>During the drive home from Moose Jaw, I kept thinking, “Who WAS that?”</p>
      <p>It was, honestly, love at first sight.</p>
      <p>Over the next few days, I made a few inquiries and discovered that her name was (how do I spell that again?) Chryssoula Filippakopoulos.</p>
      <p>She had just started working at the Moose Jaw Times-Herald after earning a journalism degree at Ryerson in her hometown of Toronto.</p>
      <p>“You should know,” one of my well-placed sources told me, “that she will only date Greek guys.”</p>
      <p>Like the can, I was crushed.</p>
      <p>Time went by. We were not introduced until the following summer, when our paths crossed at a Moose Jaw Diamond Dogs baseball game. (Murray Brace, we miss thee.)</p>
      <p>I was a nervous disaster. I had no idea what to say to Chryssoula, although it did occur to me to inform her that my surname was, ohhhh, Metropoulos?</p>
      <p>In any event, nothing was accomplished in 1995. Or 1996. For me, that was a hot streak, because I was more accustomed to accomplishing absolutely nothing over a span of decades.</p>
      <p>Then came Valentine’s Day, 1997.</p>
      <p>How romantic … right?</p>
      <p>There was only one problem. I spent Feb. 14 in the Coronary Care Unit at the Plains Health Centre.</p>
      <p>I woke up that morning with severe tightness in my chest … and shooting pains down both arms … and I was sweating profusely.</p>
      <p>Ill-advisedly, but with some urgency, I drove myself to the hospital — but not before taking what I thought was one last look at my Scottish terrier and warbling, “Well, it’s been fun, Oscar.”</p>
      <p>Before I knew it, I was on an examining table in Emergency, being examined by multiple cardiologists. (This is not recommended, as much as I revere cardiologists. When there is a team of cardiologists, it is not a good sign.)</p>
      <p>The doctors’ first suspicion was that I had an arterial blockage. Oh, great …</p>
      <p>However, further tests revealed that I had (how do I spell that again?) pericarditis — an inflammation of the lining of the heart.</p>
      <p>I ended up spending the night in hospital. Thanks to excellent medical care and some very large pills, I was back at work within two days.</p>
      <p>Shortly thereafter, I ran into (swoon) Chryssoula at (where else?) a Warriors game. She was surprised to see me, considering the widespread rumour that I had suffered a heart attack.</p>
      <p>I told her of my valiant, heroic struggle, showed her the pill bottle, and made a joke: “I actually feel OK. But if I owe you any money, get it from me soon, because I might not make it to my next birthday.”</p>
      <p>“When is that?” she inquired.</p>
      <p>“March 30,” I responded, demonstrating a command of the subject matter.</p>
      <p>Little did I suspect that, on March 30, 1997, I would receive a birthday card, postmarked “Moose Jaw.”</p>
      <p>That card, from Chryssoula, was the impetus for FINALLY asking her out.</p>
      <p>The rest, like the dear old Crushed Can, is history.</p>
