      <p>NEW YORK, Nov 20 — Oil prices tumbled yesterday as lingering questions over the US-China trade talks weighed on sentiment on a mixed day for global equity markets.</p>
      <p>Both US benchmark West Texas Intermediate and London’s Brent oil fell sharply on signs Beijing and Washington may be drifting further apart again.</p>
      <p>Worries about the trade war have weighed on the global growth outlook, crimping petroleum demand. Analysts are also on edge ahead of a weekly US oil inventory report that is expected to show higher stockpiles.</p>
      <p>“The lack of breakthrough or concrete progress on an initial US-China deal continues to create headwinds, particularly after both sides had offered indications that a signed phase one agreement was seemingly imminent only a few weeks earlier,” said a note from Robbie Fraser, senior commodity analyst at Schneider Electric.</p>
      <p>The latest hang-up in talks has been signs that China will agree to a “phase one” agreement only if Washington agrees to remove some existing tariffs, something US President Donald Trump has opposed.</p>
      <p>At the close, European stocks were mixed after giving up most or all of their earlier gains, while Wall Street finished mostly lower, with the Dow and S&amp;P 500 retreating from records, even as the Nasdaq notched a third straight all-time high.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Home Depot slumps</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Dow was weighed down by a more than five percent drop in Home Depot shares as it slashed its full-year sales forecast, saying the payoff from investments in e-commerce and other ventures was taking longer than expected.</p>
      <p>Despite that disappointment, analysts took heart in other aspects of the Home Depot report, including a 3.6 percent increase in comparable sales.</p>
      <p>They also cited better-than-expected US home construction data.</p>
      <p>“The economy seems to be settling into a trend level growth pattern of something in the 2% range,” economist Joel Naroff said in a client note. </p>
      <p>“An improvement in home construction would help offset what is likely to be a slowdown in consumption to a more sustainable pace.</p>
      <p>“The major unknown remains the trade tensions,” he added.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Hong Kong’s main stocks index extended Monday’s rally with another surge but continuing protests in parts of the city — particularly a violent standoff at a university — remained a source of worry.</p>
      <p>The gains come as the widespread protests that hammered the city’s transport network last week appear to have become less disruptive over the past two days.</p>
      <p>The pound, meanwhile, retreated after strong gains on Monday, with expectations that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s ruling Conservative party will win next month’s general election with a healthy majority, helping him to push through his Brexit deal. — AFP</p>
