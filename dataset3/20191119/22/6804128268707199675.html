      <h1>What Mauricio Pochettino said on his Tottenham future before sacking</h1>
      <h2>Here is what Mauricio Pochettino had to say prior to leaving Tottenham</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T22:15:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 22:15</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Clarke</a></address>
      <p>Mauricio Pochettino had been linked with a departure from Tottenham for several months but it has still come as a shock to many.</p>
      <p>Even Harry Winks was heaping praise on Pochettino during an interview with talkSPORT on Tuesday afternoon, with his quotes suggesting the players had no idea that the hammer was on the verge of being brought down on the Argentinian.</p>
      <p>Yet move forward to this (Tuesday) evening and Daniel Levy confirmed in a short statement that he had 'reluctantly' decided to relieve Pochettino of his duties.</p>
      <p>It shouldn't come as a massive surprise due to his strained relationship with Levy and the board after flirting with the idea of moving on for months now.</p>
      <p>Pochettino always maintained a desire to keep fighting but recent comments on his future in the last couple of months do in some ways point to the fact that he was expecting his time to be up sooner rather than later.</p>
      <p>After the hammering at the hands of Bayern Munich in the Champions League, Pochettino said: "Understand it's the business. I am 47 and look why do you think that I don't have white hair? It's because I don't pay attention to any of this.</p>
      <p>"I only pay attention about the need to improve our performances. If we don't improve our performance - and the results after - what will be the result? It is always the same in football. Yes, you are thinking the same as me."</p>
      <p>And following the 1-1 Premier League draw against Sheffield United earlier this month, Pochettino hinted that time could be of the essence.</p>
      <p>"I think you can see that yes we need to find the balance. We are building a team during the season, while competing in the Champions League and Premier League, the toughest league in the world, and always that is dangerous, this type of situation can happen," Pochettino explained.</p>
