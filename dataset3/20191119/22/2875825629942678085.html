      <p>Football pundit Mark Bright reckons his former team-mate Ian Wright has no chance in <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here">I'm a Celeb</a> as he is “scared of his own shadow”.</p>
      <p>Bright, below, says he knows Wright well, after they played for Crystal Palace and lived together for five years.</p>
      <p>“I do not know why he’s gone in there,” he joked on Love Sport radio.</p>
      <p>“He is scared of the dark. He is scared of snakes, he is scared of creepy crawlies, he is scared of his own shadow.”</p>

      <p>The Mirror revealed yesterday that Bright, 57, is dating Wright’s sister Dionne.</p>
      <p>This is despite a 15-year rift between the siblings, which Ian said began when Dionne disrespected his wife Nancy.</p>

      <p>Urging viewers to vote for his pal to do any of the tasks, Bright added that Wright was “very particular about food”.</p>
      <p>He added: “Eating these things, I know he’ll look, put them in his mouth and then spit them out. I can’t wait.”</p>
