      <p>Showtime has given a second season to the Daisy Haggard comedy “Back to Life,” the network announced Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Created by and starring Haggard, “Back to Life” centers on Miri Matteson, who, after 18 years behind bars, returns home and stumbles back into adult life in the coastal town she once knew, while the mystery of her past looms large. It is set to wrap its six-episode first season on Nov. 24.</p>
      <p>“‘Back to Life’ is a charming, funny and introspective comedy that resonates beautifully with Showtime viewers,” said Jana Winograde, president of Entertainment. “With such sharp writing and sensitive, winning performances from Daisy and the cast, we are confident that this gem from across the pond has even more delights to share with us in season two.”</p>

      <p>Season 2 will be a co-production between Showtime and BBC Three. “Fleabag” vets Harry and Jack Williams of Two Brothers Pictures serve as executive producers alongside Haggard and Sarah Hammond. Haggard’s co-writer Laura Solon also serves as a co-executive producer.</p>
      <p>Geraldine James, Richard Durden, Jo Martin, Jamie Michie, Christine Bottomley, Adeel Akhtar and Liam Williams also star.</p>
      <p>Said Haggard, “Laura and I are delighted that Showtime and the BBC are giving us a chance to continue Miri’s story. There’s so much more to tell, and we are incredibly grateful to have the opportunity to do that!”</p>
      <p>“The reception that ‘Back to Life’ has received has been amazing,” said Harry Williams, managing director of Two Brothers Pictures. “Daisy and Laura are those rare writers that can make you laugh and cry in equal measure – which is a wonderful quality. We can’t wait for fans to see what they have in store for Miri this time around.”</p>
