      <p>It may be 25 years since the last episode of the iconic sitcom <i>Friends</i> aired on NBC, but the mania the series inspired shows no sign of abating. Last month, Jennifer Aniston joined Instagram, then Warner Bros. opened <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/friends-turns-25-inside-new-york-city-pop-up-1237174">an immersive pop-up space</a> in New York City, and now an auction selling off a selection of the show’s props has been announced.</p>
