      <p>Saskatoon vegan restaurant Gud Eats is expanding to Regina, and the brand has been acquired by Leo’s Group.</p>
      <p>The Regina location at 1810 Smith St., behind Norwood on the corner of 11th Avenue downtown, will be Gud Eats’ second storefront.</p>
      <p>“Chef and founder Chris Cole has been in the hospitality industry for over 20 years. Gud Eats Inc. is the culmination of Chris’ culinary creativity and personal lifestyle,” Leo’s Group stated on social media.</p>
      <p>“His goal is not to convert or judge any dietary choices, but rather demonstrate how satisfying plant-based eating can be.”</p>
      <p>Gud Eats’ pub-style menu includes meatless versions of fried chicken, hotdogs, <a href="https://leaderpost.com/opinion/columnists/off-beat-vegetarians-vegans-and-beef-lovers-rejoice-the-beyond-burger-is-here">burgers (Beyond and housemade)</a> and shrimp, and dairy/cheese-free versions of ice cream, cheesecake, macaroni and poutine.</p>
      <p>Having started as a food truck in August 2017 as Saskatchewan’s first-ever totally plant-based fast food vendor, Gud Eats’ first storefront opened in Saskatoon’s Brevoort Park neighbourhood in November 2017.</p>
      <p>The Saskatoon location also includes a mini-market that sells housemade faux-chicken and “skrimp,” as well as known brands like Miyoko’s, Beyond and Earth Island.</p>

Now, it has acquired a controlling interest in Gud Eats.</p>
      <p>The Leo’s Group restaurants already include a plant-based section on their menus.</p>
      <p>“It was essential to me that they saw the importance of plant-based eating, not only as a fiscal and viable investment, but as an ethical, environmental, and sustainable foundation,” Cole said in a news release.</p>
      <p>“I am very impressed and inspired by the growth and success they have accomplished in such a short time. It is endearing that both of our roots are here in Saskatchewan, choosing our home province as a starting point for our businesses.”</p>
      <p>The Regina location is currently under construction, according to a neighbouring tenant.</p>
