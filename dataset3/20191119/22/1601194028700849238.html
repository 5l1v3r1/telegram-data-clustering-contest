      <p>There was a time when the <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/francis-ngannou">Francis Ngannou</a> hype train had well and truly been derailed, however, the Cameroonian-French Heavyweight restored his intimidating aura by putting together three consecutive finishes in the past year.</p>
      <p>Ngannou, who hasn't fought since June this year, could end his short hiatus soon as the #2 ranked Heavyweight revealed that he had had a very productive meeting with Dana White and Hunter Campbell of the <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/ufc">UFC</a>.</p>
      <p>The Predator stated that he is excited to get back to work and that the fans should be prepared for some big news that's on the way.</p>
      <p>He tweeted:</p>
      <blockquote>Just had a very productive meeting with the boss man <a href="https://twitter.com/danawhite">@danawhite</a> and Hunter Campbell <a href="https://twitter.com/ufc">@ufc</a>. Excited to get back to work. Big news coming soon <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UNCROWNDEDCHAMP?src=hash">#UNCROWNDEDCHAMP</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/thepredator?src=hash">#thepredator</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Francis2020?src=hash">#Francis2020</a></blockquote>

      <p>Ngannou has been on a rampage ever since suffering back-to-back losses to Stipe Miocic and Derrick Lewis in 2018.</p>
      <p>The Heavyweight contender faced Curtis Blaydes, Cain Velasquez and Junior dos Santos after the aforementioned defeats and managed to score first-round knockouts in all three fights.</p>
      <p>Ngannou is now the favourite to get a Heavyweight title shot against Stipe Miocic, however, the current Heavyweight Champion could end up facing Daniel Cormier in a trilogy fight next year.</p>
      <p>DC wants to get into the Octagon for his last fight against Miocic before hanging up his gloves. Ngannou, however, is in no mood to wait and is willing to fight whoever the UFC puts in his way.</p>
      <p>So, who could the Predator face next? I guess we just have to wait for the 'big news' to be announced.</p>
