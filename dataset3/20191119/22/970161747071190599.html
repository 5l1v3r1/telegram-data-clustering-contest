      <p>Vikings creator Michael Hirst has announced his first Vikings spin-off.</p>
      <p>Vikings Valhalla, set 100 years after the original series, will follow some familiar characters.</p>
      <p>Leif Erickson, Freydis, Harald Hardrada and William the Conqueror are set to make an appearance.</p>
      <p>However the news raises some questions, as Freydis was killed by Ivar the Boneless in season five. It will be interesting to see how this one plays out.</p>
      <p>Netflix announced the news on Twitter, revealing that the historical drama will be leaving History Channel.</p>
      <p>In a short notice it read: ‘#Vikings creator Michael Hirst is picking up — almost — where he left off with #VikingsValhalla, a new series set 100 years after the original.</p>
      <p>‘This saga will follow the most famous Vikings who ever lived: Leif Erickson, Freydis, Harald Harada, and William the Conqueror!’</p>

      <p>Before we get to that, there’s the small business of the final season of Vikings to watch first.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>A new trailer for season six didn’t go down well with fans <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/vikings-fans-outraged-season-6-teaser-basically-confirms-major-character-death-11182405/">as they felt it gave away the death of a major character.</a></p>
      <p>Hopefully any upcoming teasers will be a bit more…teasery.</p>
      <p>The new season could also see a potential team up between Ivar (Alex Høgh Andersen) and Prince Oleg (Danila Kozlovsky), and Lagertha (Kathryn Winnick) seemingly go back on her word to not get involved in any more battles.</p>
      <p>‘We must all prepare for another attack’, despite <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/09/vikings-fans-convinced-lagertha-dies-swears-fight-no-season-6-teaser-11070739/">previously vowing to ‘fight no more’</a> in an earlier trailer.</p>
      <p>Her words convinced fans that she might be the one to bite the dust in the final season as she was seen burying the Sword of Kings, which she gave to son Bjorn (Alexander Ludwig) at the end of season five.</p>
      <p>Actress Kathryn has hinted that the shieldmaiden’s time might be up this season, teasing that this is her ‘final chapter’.</p>

      <p>Chatting to ET Canada, the 41-year-old said: ‘She is trying to now redefine who she is as someone who is a grandmother and used to be a queen, and a warrior, and now finding new peace, and redefining her last chapter.’</p>
      <p>It will be the final chapter for many of the characters, as the sixth season will sadly be the last.</p>
