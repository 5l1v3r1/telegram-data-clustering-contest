      <p><a href="https://wwd.com/tag/thom-browne/">Thom Browne</a> got a big pay day when he sold the majority stake in his namesake company to the <a href="https://wwd.com/tag/ermenegildo-zegna-2/">Ermenegildo Zegna</a> Group for around $500 million and he seems to be spending some of that money on a new home in Manhattan.</p>
      <p>The designer and his partner, Andrew Bolton, head curator of the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute, recently bought a 15-room town house on the Upper East Side for $13 million, property records showed.</p>
      <p>It was originally on the market for $21 million and the seller was the late Drue Heinz, who was married to Henry J. Heinz 2nd, the former president of Heinz.</p>
      <p>Heinz was not the only famous name to have resided at the building. Other former owners include Charles Merrill, cofounder of Merrill Lynch, while the house was originally built for a member of the wealthy Vanderbilt family back in 1920.</p>
      <p>With all those names attached to it, the Georgian brick four-story abode with views of the East River is fittingly grand.</p>
      <p>According to the listing, which was held by Sotheby’s, guests are greeted with a sprawling entrance where a spiral staircase stands center stage.</p>
      <p>On the ground floor, there’s a 21-foot dining room, while the staircase leads to an even bigger 32-foot drawing room overlooking the garden where guests can retire after dinner.</p>
      <p>The home has a total of six bedrooms, with the master suite located on the third floor, overlooking a large garden. It comes with a white marble bathroom, custom closets, as well as a dressing area.</p>
      <p>The pièce de résistance, though, has to be a sun room on the fourth floor with a glass ceiling and walls with views of the nearby area.</p>
      <p>There are also staff rooms and an elevator that accesses all floors.</p>
      <p>A representative for Browne did not respond to request for comment.</p>
