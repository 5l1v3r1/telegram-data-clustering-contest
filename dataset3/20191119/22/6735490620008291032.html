      <p>Tuesday marked a big day for Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel, with the “Frozen” co-stars each awarded their own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.</p>
      <p>In the joint ceremony, each woman unveiled her respective star and delivered a speech, with Bell using hers to joke about the seediness of Hollywood Boulevard.</p>
      <p>“I am so grateful to be accepting this honour today on these hallowed streets where Pretty Woman sold her body for money,” she quipped. “It’s really a dream!”</p>

      <p>Shifting between comedy and sentimentality, Bell reflected on her career and thanked her parents (who were in attendance) and husband Dax Shepard (who wasn’t) for their support.</p>
      <p>Bell also shared some advice she received from Cher, which she now refers to as “the Cher test.” As she recalled, the Oscar-winning icon once told her, “If it doesn’t matter in five years, it doesn’t matter.”</p>
      <p>Of course, Bell couldn’t resist the opportunity to make a “Frozen” joke, revealing the true meaning behind the film’s signature song.</p>

      <p>“This star will really only know its true value when, inevitably, someone is mugged in that very spot, and as they clutch their purse the assailant screams, ‘Let it go!’ And the victim will look up and say, ‘That’s not even her song you son of a b***h,'” joked Bell. “Only then will I know that I’ve truly made it.”</p>
