      <h1>Bargaining stalls for Regina Public Schools education support workers</h1>
      <h2>CUPE Local 3766, which represents education support workers at Regina Public Schools, says bargaining has stalled and the local has filed for an impasse.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T22:56:52+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 22:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://leaderpost.com/author/lgiesbrechtpostmedia" target="_blank">Lynn Giesbrecht</a></address>
      <p>The union representing education support workers at Regina Public Schools has filed for an impasse, saying talks between it and the division have broken down.</p>
      <p><a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/public-education-support-workers-vote-in-favour-of-job-action">In July, CUPE Local 3766 — which represents more than 600 education support workers at Regina Public Schools — voted 95 per cent in favour of a strike mandate.</a> Despite this, the local said in a news release Tuesday morning that progress at the bargaining table had stalled.</p>
      <p>“We presented a fair deal to our employer that reflected our beliefs. It is disappointing that our employer continues to refuse to remove their bargaining concessions,” Jackie Christianson, president of the local, said in the release.</p>
      <p>Workers represented by the union include education assistants, administrative assistants, nutrition co-ordinators, food service assistants, interpreters, teacher associates and library assistants. Regina public system education support workers have been without a contract for three years.</p>
      <p>In an interview, Christianson said the division is currently offering the local members two years of no wage increases, despite the fact members have been without a raise for more than four years. She said they are also asking members to accept decreased health and dental plans.</p>
      <p>Christianson recognized that <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/we-cannot-continue-to-tighten-regina-school-divisions-face-another-tough-budget">tight budgets for school divisions</a> across the province have made bargaining a challenge, but said the Regina Public School Division is the only division in the province that has refused to take concessions off the table.</p>
      <p>“What they are asking us to do will be harmful to our members,” she said, noting she was particularly concerned about how the proposed lower prescription drug coverage would impact members, whose average gross income is only $27,000 a year.</p>
      <p>“They simply can’t afford what we have right now, and you want to reduce that? That is not right.”</p>
      <p>The Regina Public School Division declined to comment.</p>
      <p>Because an impasse has been filed, a mediator will now be brought in. Christianson said she hopes a mediator can convince the division that what they are offering is “unrealistic.”</p>
