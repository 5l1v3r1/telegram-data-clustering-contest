A new software update has just been announced by Samsung in the official Newsroom. If you own a Galaxy Watch or Watch Active, you may want to read this.</p>
      <p>Older smartwatches from the South Korean tech giant will receive dynamic updates. Important changes include Samsung Health features, customization options, and new Bixby functions. The update will be released incrementally region by region although no official list has been provided.</p>
      <p>The latest software update will bring more Bixby advantages like Bixby Voice which is ideal to use in controlling your SmartThings ecosystem, know the time between places, and start exercise routines. Bixby can soon learn your routines and even language but may be limited to British English, Spanish, Italian, German, and French, at least, for now.</p>
