      <h2>Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn went head-to-head on ITV tonight</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T22:12:12+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 22:12</time> by <a rel="author">Bristol Post</a></address>
      <p>Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn have just gone head-to-head in the first leadership battle of the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/general-election">general election.</a></p>
      <p>The debate, hosted tonight (November 19) at Manchester’s media city and chaired by TV presenter Julie Etchingam, was a chance for both leaders to polish their credentials and win over voters ahead of the election on December 12.</p>
      <p>Jeremy Corbyn’s team would have been angling for the chance to present their leader as more in step with public opinion than the Tories would like to make out, while for <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> the task would have been to show that the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/conservative-party">Tory</a> leader is Prime Minister material and should remain in the top job.</p>
      <h3>Here are the key takeaways:</h3>
      <p>
        <b>1. Jeremy Corbyn refused to say how he would campaign in a potential second referendum</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Prime Minister repeatedly quizzed his opposite number on whether Labour would campaign to remain in a second <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> referendum. He traded blows by saying Mr Corbyn was refusing to come clean with the British public on the issue.</p>
      <p>“Does he believe in the deal he is proposing to do?” Mr Johnson asked. “Or is he absurdly going to campaign against it?”</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn’s response was that Labour would negotiate a new agreement which would be put alongside remain. He said the referendum would “give people the choice”.</p>
      <p>The Labour leader also took a swipe at the Prime Minister’s claim that he would get Brexit done, arguing that it could take around seven years to negotiate a trade deal with the US. “We’re not going to get it done in a few months and you know that perfectly well," he said.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2. Jeremy Corbyn did not rule out a second referendum on Scotland</b>

      <p>The Prime Minister pressed Mr Corbyn on the “price” he would pay for securing the support of the SNP and its leader, Nicola Sturgeon, if there was a hung parliament or a Labour minority government.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn dismissed this as “nonsense”. </p>
      <p>“There is not going to be a coalition between Labour and anyone else.</p>
      <p>“There is going to be no deal with the SNP and no support for a second referendum in the early years of a Labour government.”</p>
      <p>“I didn’t hear him say he was going to rule out  referendum of Scotland” Mr Johnson replied, before alluding to David Cameron’s 2015 election message of “chaos with Ed Miliband” by saying that, under Corbyn, there would be a “chaotic coalition” with the SNP.</p>
      <p>“We’ve had nine years of chaotic coalition already,” the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> leader quips, to laughs and cheers from the audience. <br/> </p>
      <p>
        <b>3. Jeremy Corbyn draws biggest applause on issue of NHS privatisation</b>
      </p>
      <p>At one point the Labour leader produced documents which outlined US-UK trade negotiations and how this could grant US firms “full market access” to the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/nhs">NHS</a> as part of a trade deal. His gesture earns him big applause from the audience.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister responds by saying that allegations that the Tories will privatise the NHS are an “absolute invention”.  </p>
      <p>“The NHS will never be for sale,” he said. “I’m amazed at how often this comes up. He is trying to conceal a void at the heart of his Brexit policy.”</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson also hits out at Labour’s “crackpot” plan for a four-day working week, which he says will add to the burden already faced by the NHS and other public services. </p>
      <p>The Labour leader responds by saying it will be paid for by increases in productivity, which is met with some laughter by the audience. </p>
      <p>He also disputes the Conservatives’ claim that it is building 40 new hospitals, saying in fact it amounts to six “configurations”.</p>
      <p>
        <b>4. Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn shake hands with pledge to improve language in Brexit debate</b>
      </p>
      <p>There is a rare moment of unity when the two leaders leave their podiums to shake hands and signal that they will honour a pledge to improve the language in the Brexit debate, which an audience member had earlier branded “toxic”.</p>
      <p>
        <b>5. Both parties pledge to end austerity</b>
      </p>

      <p>Mr Corbyn replies that Labour will end austerity and that the party will increase corporation tax to 2010 levels, to invest in education and to address the “grotesque levels of imbalance” in the UK.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson also vows to end austerity, saying that he believes in spending and investing in public services.</p>
      <p>Ms Etchingham suggests this could require “extraordinary” levels of borrowing. “Have you found a magic money tree Mr Johsnon, and have you found more than one of them Mr Corbyn?” she asks.</p>
