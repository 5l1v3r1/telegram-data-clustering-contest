      <h1>“Shut The Fuck Up”: Deadmau5 Unleashes On DJ Duo In ‘Semi-Drunk’ Rant</h1>

      <p>Deadmau5 has never been one to shy away from expressing his opinions.</p>
      <p>One of the mouthiest DJs in the game, he’s become known for his unabashed honesty (or: outright rudeness), commenting on everything from the state of the industry to <a href="https://junkee.com/nastiest-music-beefs-2017/140206">the particular industry players that he has a gripe with.</a></p>
      <p>But this week, he took that troublemaking energy to the next level, going on what he later described as a “semi-drunken” Reddit rant against Dimitri Vegas and Like Mike, two DJs he shared a bill with at a recent festival.</p>

      <p>“Dimitri and Like Mike or whatever the fuck they are need to seriously SHUT THE FUCK UP?” Deadmau5 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/deadmau5/comments/dxz90m/im_sorry/">wrote in a tirade</a> against the duo’s habit of frequently using the mic during their set, <a href="https://mixmag.net/read/deadmau5-dimitri-vegas-like-mike-semi-drunk-rant-news">as per <i>Mixmag</i></a>. “Seriously. How hard is it to get through a set without fucking picking up the mic for three seconds without asking how everyone is?</p>
      <p>“It’s bad enough they’re playing the worst fucking music I’ve heard all decade much less describing it every fuckin’ four seconds on a PA. Play the fucking CD, fist pump and clap if you must… But holy shit. SHUT THE FUCK UP.”</p>
      <p>Later, Deadmau5 clarified the rant — kinda.</p>
      <p>“Lol was semi drunk writing that for the most part, I don’t give a shit,” he wrote. “Fuck ’em. I think my big problem was that their stage and they’re incessant yapping was like 20 feet from ours and I’m trying to play and all I can hear are these fools. Lol … Reminder to myself, never play on the same bill as these fucking pieces of shit.”</p>
      <p>So, not exactly an apology then, as much as it was an opportunity to further gripe against two musicians unfortunate enough to share a bill with the man. Oh well. Deadmau5 is gonna Deadmau5 is the lesson, I guess?</p>
