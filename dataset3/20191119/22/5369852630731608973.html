      <p>NEW ZEALANDER DAVE Rennie has been tasked with resurrecting the Wallabies, replacing Michael Cheika as head coach in a deal that will take him through to the 2023 World Cup.</p>
      <p>The 55-year-old, only the second non-Australian to lead the team, will fulfil his commitments to Scottish side Glasgow Warriors, where he is currently coach, before assuming his new role in July next year.</p>
      <p>The Wallabies are due to play Ireland in Brisbane on July 4, giving Rennie little time to stamp his mark on the Michael Hooper-led side before their home season gets under way.</p>
      <p>That first series will be an important one to restore faith in the team after their dismal World Cup quarter-final exit to England in Japan, where their tactics were widely criticised.</p>
      <p>Rugby Australia chief Raelene Castle said Rennie had always been their favoured choice to replace Cheika, who fell on his sword after the World Cup and a series of poor results leading into it.</p>
      <p>“This is a massive coup for Australian rugby. Dave Rennie was the clear standout candidate for the job, and we’re thrilled to have secured his services,” she said.</p>
      <p>“Dave’s coaching philosophy focuses equally on football and team culture, the key pillars to building sustainable success in any team. </p>
      <p>“He has a proven track record in the northern and southern hemisphere.”</p>
      <p>Rennie, who follows Robbie Deans as the only other foreigner to coach the Wallabies, had reportedly been sounded out by New Zealand Rugby about applying for the All Blacks job.</p>

      <p>But All Blacks assistant Ian Foster and three-time Super Rugby-winning Crusaders coach Scott Robertson appear to be the front-runners for that position, left vacant by Steve Hansen’s departure.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been coaching professionally for over 20 years and wherever I’ve gone, I’ve immersed myself in the community and culture. I believe I can make a difference here,” said Rennie of Australia. </p>
      <p>“There are some outstanding young men coming through the schools system. I want to create a strong connection with the Super Rugby and national age-grade coaches and help them achieve their goals, which will benefit the Wallabies in time.</p>
      <p>“When I met Raelene Castle, I was really impressed with her plans for the future of Australian rugby and I’m keen to be part of that,” he added.</p>
      <p>Rennie joined New Zealand Super Rugby franchise the Chiefs as coach in 2012 and led them to back-to-back southern hemisphere titles in his first two years in charge. </p>
      <p>The Hamilton-based team played finals in each of the six seasons he spent with them, a mark unmatched by any head coach in the competition’s history.</p>

      <p>He was appointed coach of Glasgow Warriors for the 2017/18 season and in his second year took them to the Pro-14 final and the last eight of the European Champions Cup, the first time the Warriors have made the playoffs in both competitions.</p>
