      <h1>Tom Brady Reacts To Eagles Being Accused of Pumping in Crowd Noise During Game</h1>

      <p>It’s not often where a team playing the New England Patriots gets accused of cheating, but that was the case this past Sunday.</p>
      <p>The Philadelphia Eagles needed to beat the New England Patriots on Sunday night in order to stay with the Dallas Cowboys in the NFC East race, and it looks like they tried something extra to make sure of that.</p>
      <p>Scott Zolak of 98.5 The Sports Hub accused the Eagles of adding extra crowd noise at Lincoln Financial Field when the Patriots were on offense.</p>

      <p>Patriots quarterback Tom Brady was asked about this on <a href="https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/patriots/did-eagles-pump-crowd-noise-vs-patriots-tom-brady-didnt-notice">WEEI’s The Greg Hill Show</a> and he seemed to enjoy the speculation.</p>
      <blockquote>“Good job, Zo! I like it,” Brady said per NBC Sports Boston. “I didn’t notice, but again, those are not the things I would notice. Loud is loud. At one point when you can’t hear, basically it’s like ‘loud’ and then ‘louder,’ but you’re really not going to notice the difference much.”</blockquote>
      <p>After the Eagles took a 10-0 lead early on in the second quarter, the Patriots defense didn’t allow another point for the remainder of the game as the team walked away with a 17-10 win.</p>
      <p>Brady was happy with the win, but frustrated with the offense not being able to get it going.</p>
      <blockquote>“It’s just part of how our season’s gone,” Brady said to Jim Gray of Westwood One Radio per NBC Sports Boston. “I think there’s a lot of things we talk about internally. Things that we see that we need to do to continue to try to improve … we’re going to have to just execute better than we did and better than we have.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>“We’re 9-1, our defense is playing great, our special teams unit is playing great and they’re keeping us in every game. Offensively, I’ve said we’ve got to take advantage when we have opportunities in [a] short field and we had a few of those yesterday. Those are the ones that probably frustrate me the most.”</blockquote>
      <p>So far in 2019, Brady has thrown for 2,752 yards, 14 touchdowns, five interceptions and he has a passer rating of 90.1</p>
