      <p>-imperatives to go abreast with the obtaining environment so that it spurs the country’s community development.</p>
      <p>Dr Jingu revealed this when speaking to heads of community development colleges, instructors thereof, senior officials from the ministry and community development institutions who are currently meeting in Morogoro. He added that the reforms must also go together with advances in information and communication technology (ICT).</p>
      <p>He said: “You must ask yourselves – what you teach – can it enable our experts to create employment instead of them becoming searchers of employment? We must find answers, since that is the environment we find ourselves in which changes due to technology. Right now we have multiparty system which also impacts on other life platforms, but also the education we give should satisfy market needs, and if it doesn’t then that is a challenge.”</p>
      <p>He also wanted them to consider whether the influx of foreign investors into the country needing staff to employ need the type of students who graduate from the colleges?</p>
      <p>He added: “These days it is not sufficient to know how to read and write or to read more books, there are skills one must have – soft skills – you have to be creative, smart and have a degree of adaptability.”</p>
      <p>Dr Jingu also said they should consider the system of certificates conferred to students by the colleges; they should aim in higher education that should increase the number of students they enroll as so far their number is still small.</p>
      <p>Commissioner of Community Development Dr Naftali Ng'ondi, said the two-day meeting is one of its kind because in other occasions it brought together scholars from various institutes in the community development field – everyone on his or her own as opposed to this meeting whereby all are assembled together as their responsibilities are interdependent.</p>
      <p>He said through the meeting he believes the participants will give wide expertise and understanding in helping the society and the researches they make and advices they give should aim to help the community instead of remaining in books.</p>
      <p>The ministry’s director of community development department Patrick Golwike said there has been a long time practice to meet every year to evaluate the work they planned in the given period.</p>
      <p>He said his community development colleges have been teaching professions on community development keeping in mind theory and practical training.</p>
      <p>He said other aims include the change in the traditional teaching methods, use of apprenticeship approach to enhance students’ knowledge and therefore become self employed that can enable them to employ others as well as establishing Digital Innovation Centre.</p>
