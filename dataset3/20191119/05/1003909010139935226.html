      <h1>Council proclaims city-wide day of Holocaust remembrance</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T05:35:35+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 05:35</time> by <a rel="author">Meghan Potkins, Calgary Herald</a></address>
      <p>City council unanimously proclaimed Jan. 27 as Calgary’s annual city-wide International Holocaust Remembrance Day at a city hall meeting Monday where young Jewish students and a handful of Holocaust survivors were in attendance.</p>
      <p>“I wanted to see this happen. It’s very important for us as survivors — I’m a child survivor — to see recognition of a day,” said Terry Groner, who was born in 1936 and attended Monday’s meeting at city hall. “I was not in a concentration camp but I was hidden during the war as a Jewish child.”</p>

      <p>Proponents of the remembrance day say they’re concerned by figures showing that one in five Canadian youth are unaware of the events that occurred during the Holocaust, even as statistics continue to indicate that Jewish people are the frequent target of hate crimes and that hate crimes in general have increased sharply.</p>
      <p>Jewish people are also the most frequently targeted ethno-cultural group when it comes to police-reported hate crimes across the country, according to Statistics Canada.</p>
      <p>The motion brought forward by Coun. Diane Colley-Urquhart was endorsed by all of council.</p>

      <p>“We have Holocaust survivors here in this city and we have generations growing up who don’t know about it,” said Mayor Naheed Nenshi Monday. “I think it’s important for council to condemn bigotry in all its forms, anti-Semitism being one of them. And I think it’s important for us to commemorate the remembrance of that great loss of life in the Holocaust.”</p>
      <p>An earlier version of Colley-Urquhart’s motion included direction to city staff to explore adopting the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s (IHRA) working definition of anti-Semitism.</p>
      <p>The IHRA definition, which has been adopted by handful of countries including Canada, has come under fire in some jurisdictions for being overly broad and potentially chilling of criticism of the Israeli state.</p>
      <p>The final motion passed by council Monday enshrined Calgary’s annual Holocaust day of remembrance, but did not include direction to the City of Calgary on the adoption of an official definition of anti-Semitism.</p>
