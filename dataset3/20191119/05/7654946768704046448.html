      <h1>Nic Claxton’s new Nets role won’t change with rough night</h1>

      <p>Nic Claxton hadn’t given Nets coach Kenny Atkinson any reason to keep him out of the rotation.</p>
      <p>And when the 20-year-old rookie was an early sub — before veteran big-man DeAndre Jordan — into <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/18/kyrie-irving-less-nets-crumble-against-pacers-in-blowout-loss/">the Nets’ eventual 115-86 loss to the Pacers</a> on Monday night, it became apparent that Claxton has officially written himself into Atkinson’s plans.</p>
      <p>“Maybe stylistically it’s not exactly what we want system-wise,” Atkinson said prior to tipoff against Indiana. “It doesn’t matter. We need his talent. He can affect the game in other ways. Another guy that’s not afraid to shoot it. At Georgia, he shot a ton of 3s. I think he’s capable.”</p>
      <p>Even though Atkinson considered himself lucky to have both Jordan and Jarrett Allen to split minutes at center, the emergence of Claxton has added depth to both the five and the four.</p>
      <p>Checking in with more than half of the first quarter remaining, the 31st-overall pick found himself on the court earlier than usual since getting called up roughly two weeks ago.</p>
      <p>In his Barclays Center debut, Claxton looked his age and went 0-for-1 from the field in 14:42 with just one point off a free throw. It was the near 7-foot forward’s exceptional play during their five-game road trip that made Atkinson, who is known to go with a shooter over height, admit that he would go against his usual ways in order to utilize Claxton.</p>

      <p>But Claxton knows he has a long way to go before he can be the impact player the Nets hope he can become.</p>
      <p>“Not extremely comfortable [right now], just to be honest,” Claxton told The Post after the loss. “Just trying to find a role for myself. I just gotta stay ready and whenever the opportunity presents itself for me.”</p>
      <p>Monday’s game was the fourth straight game without Caris LeVert, who is out indefinitely after having thumb surgery. And Kyrie Irving sat for the second game in a row as the Nets’ star point guard continues to battle a shoulder injury. The need for Claxton to eat up significant minutes has become vital, but his ability to contribute is just an added bonus.</p>
      <p>Allen, the usual starter at the five, is averaging 25.6 minutes per game, while Jordan has been on the floor for 22.4 minutes per game. Even though both Allen and Jordan have at least six more games to factor in this season, Claxton isn’t far behind with 14 minutes per game.</p>
      <p>Over 85 minutes in six games, Claxton has registered 15 points and grabbed 14 rebounds with seven assists. He has yet to turn the ball over and has committed just four fouls so far, showing a matureness to his game that has kept him around. And even though Claxton couldn’t do much to combat the Pacers’ tenacity on Monday, it’s safe to say that he’ll have ample opportunities to find a role in Brooklyn.</p>

      <p>The Nets bench provided just 24 points and only four in the first half.</p>
      <p>“We gotta look at it,” Atkinson said. “They were good in Chicago [on Saturday] and the reverse happened tonight. We really gotta look at it.”</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Two-way player Timothe Luwawu-Cabarrot made his Nets debut and hit one of two free throws.</p>
      <p>“I just got to keep on learning, the NBA is a lot different,” he said.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>“He does everything we ask him,” Atkinson said. “We need his rebounding, we need his ability to run the floor. His rebounding is huge, offensive rebounding, he’s defensively hard to finish on. So, take all those positives and the talent and with our absences, he needs to play and he will play.”</p>
