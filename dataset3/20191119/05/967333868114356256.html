        <b>Bruce Bagley, a Miami University professor who co-wrote a book titled 'Drug Trafficking, Organized Crime, and Violence in the Americas Today' in 2015, is now facing three criminal cases related to laundering money out of Venezuela into the US.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Prosecutors in Manhattan accuse Bagley, 73, an expert on international studies and a professor at the University of Miami, of laundering cash out from Venezuela into the United States, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7699473/Professor-73-wrote-book-organized-crime-helped-launder-2M-Venezuela.html">The Daily Mail reported.</a></p>
      <p>Prosecutors claim that Bagley, co-author of Drug Trafficking, Organized Crime, and Violence in the Americas Today, played a key role in laundering over $2.5 million from the “proceeds of bribery and corruption, <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201911131077293616-us-charges-guatemalan-bank-chief-ex-politician-for-laundering-drug-money/">stolen from the citizens</a> of Venezuela”, and set aside an estimated $250,000 for himself.</p>
      <p>The lawsuit alleges that <a href="https://sputniknews.com/analysis/201903261073514236-us-sanctions-maduro/">Bagley received and passed monthly cash</a> deposits from bank accounts in Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates, transferring 90 percent of the money to a third party, while keeping a percentage for himself.</p>
      <blockquote>“Today's charges of money laundering and conspiracy should serve as an object lesson for Bruce Bagley, who <a href="https://sputniknews.com/europe/201910301077183599-estonian-prime-minister-counts-on-cooperation-with-us-in-fighting-money-laundering/">now faces a potential tenure</a> in federal prison,” said US Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman, quoted by The Daily Mail.</blockquote>
      <p>According to the report, a representative of the University of Miami said that the <a href="https://sputniknews.com/russia/201910151077051194-searches-related-to-money-laundering-case-against-anti-corruption-foundation-underway-across-russia/">University was briefed Monday</a> afternoon on the indictment against the professor.</p>
      <blockquote>“In light of this development, Professor Bagley is on administrative leave. As this is a personal matter in an ongoing investigation, the University <a href="https://sputniknews.com/russia/201909131076795672-kremlin-aware-of-money-laundering-case-against-anti-corruption-foundation/">has no further commen</a>t at this time,” a representative of the school said.</blockquote>
      <p>Although TDM reported that they have contacted Bagley, there has been no comment from the accused professor.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors claim that they noticed “suspicious activity” in the period between November 2017 and October 2018, as the university professor received over $2.5 million from foreign bank accounts that were found to belong to a Colombian man whose name <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201907041076146407-the-wolf-of-wall-street-producer-riza-aziz-held-malaysia-money-laundering/">has not yet been revealed</a>.</p>
      <blockquote>“As we allege, Bagley, an American professor, contributed to the success of illegal activity overseas, carried out against the Venezuelan people, by<a href="https://sputniknews.com/business/201906221076020120-money-laundering-watchdog-crypto-exchanges-user-data/"> facilitating access to illicitly</a> obtained funds, and profiting from his role in the crime,” according to FBI assistant director-in-charge William F. Sweeney Jr.</blockquote>
      <p>Sweeney suggested that Bagley’s story should be a lesson to others, warning that “involving oneself in public corruption, bribery, and embezzlement schemes is going to lead to an indictment”.</p>
