      <h1>Are these the worst and best toilets ever in Liverpool?</h1>
      <h2>This World Toilet Day people across Liverpool have flushed out public conveniences to praise and condemn</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T05:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/jenny-kirkham/" target="_blank">Jenny Kirkham</a></address>
      <p>People across Liverpool have had their say on the best and worst toilets in the city.</p>
      <p>According to United Nations Water, 4.5 billion people live without a safe toilet. Which is why <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/world-toilet-day-inside-best-15437531">World Toilet Day</a> aims to raise awareness about the billions of people across the world don't have access to toilets and sanitation.</p>
      <p>World Toilet Day, celebrated on November 19, is about taking action to ensure that everyone has a safe toilet by 2030.</p>
      <p>So whether it's a tip top toilet or bog standard here are some of the best and worst in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">Liverpool</a> from down the years - decided by you.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Krazyhouse</b>
      </p>
      <p>On <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a>, Jason Walsh made his feelings about the former <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/remembering-krazyhouse-faustini-thundercats-pickled-15015407">Krazyhouse</a> toilets known to everyone.</p>
      <p>The venue has <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/new-club-electrik-announced-takeover-15060592">now changed hands and returned with a facelift</a> but the memories of the old toilets clearly live on.</p>

      <p>Speaking about the ex-Wood Street club, he said: "Nowhere will ever be worse than the Krazyhouse toilets."</p>
      <p>
        <b>Le Bateau</b>
      </p>
      <p>Despite the love for former Duke Street venue <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/le-bateau-memories---boat-3343967">Le Bateau</a>, a former Liverpool student described the club's toilets as a "death trap" before it closed.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>They said: "Le Bateau was an amazing venue but the toilets on the top floor felt like a death trap - and often smelled like something had already died in there"</p>
      <p>
        <b>Pleasure Rooms</b>
      </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/look-back-liverpools-iconic-pleasure-13747287">Pleasure Rooms</a> are nostalgically remembered by many people across Liverpool - but some would soon rather forget the state of its bathrooms.</p>
      <p>Ste Welsby said: "The pleasure rooms toilets at 3am onwards. Hands down the worst toilers since time began."</p>
      <p>
        <b>No love for toilets at city ASDA supermarkets</b>
      </p>
      <p>A number of <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">ECHO</a> readers commented on the cleanliness of a number of supermarket toilets across Liverpool.</p>
      <p>Fred Holtham said: "Asda Smithdown Road are the worst ever. The smell alone stops you from going in."</p>
      <p>Antonia Curran also responded about the toilets at the ASDA supermarket in Hunts Cross.</p>

      <p>She said: "Asda Huntscross are the worst."</p>
      <p>In reply, Wendy Moulton said: "I swear they are never cleaned."</p>
      <p>Jemma Simpson added: "Ahh yeah I agree they smell so bad x"</p>
      <p>
        <b>Lime Street Station</b>
      </p>
      <p>The toilets at Lime Street Station are clearly an area of tension due to the cleanliness and the fact you have to pay to use them.</p>
      <p>Wendy Aston said: "Lime street station toilets are a nightmare!</p>
      <p>"The cubicles are tiny and the sinks are ridiculous, you can't wash your hands properly."</p>

      <h3>And now for some of the best...</h3>
      <p>Clayton Square and Metquarter came out on top as the people's choice.</p>
      <p>Emma Bowles said: "Met quarter hands down the best."</p>
      <p>Dan Ambrose also said: "Clayton Square or Met Quarter."</p>
      <p>Laura Jane added: "Clayton Square! Never a queue, pristine and there’s a ledge for your shopping."</p>
