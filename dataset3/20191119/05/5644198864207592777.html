      <p>JOHANNESBURG: Egypt, without injured striker Mo Salah, lacked a cutting edge in front of goal as they were held to a 0-0 draw by tiny Comoros Islands in their 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier on Monday.</p>
      <p>Midfielder Kahraba struck the crossbar early on and forward Trezeguet missed a one-on-one chance in the second period, but Egypt also had goalkeeper Mohamed El Shenawy to thank for important saves.</p>

      <p>The result follows a 1-1 home draw with Kenya in their Group G opener on Thursday and was wildly celebrated by the home fans, who invaded the pitch at the final whistle.</p>
      <p>In the other Group G game, Kenya and Togo drew 1-1. Johanna Omolo put the east Africans in front before Hakim Ouro-Sama equalised for the visitors.</p>
      <p>African champions Algeria were made to sweat but collected a 1-0 victory in Botswana as Youcef Belaili netted after 15 minutes to ensure a full haul of six points from their opening two games in Group H.</p>
      <p>Ghana needed a second half penalty from Jordan Ayew to claim a 1-0 success over Sao Tome and Principe on a difficult artificial surface as they also made it two wins from two in Group C.</p>
      <p>Pa Modou Jagne scored an injury-time equaliser for Gambia in a 2-2 draw with the Democratic Republic of Congo in Group D to follow on from their surprise 3-1 success in Angola last week.</p>
      <p>Cedric Bakambu and Jackson Muleka netted for the Congolese, who led twice in the contest, but Bubacarr Jobe and Jagne rescued a point for the home side.</p>
      <p>It was a similar story in Praia, where Mozambique scored in injury time at the end of the game to salvage a 2-2 draw against hosts Cape Verde Islands.</p>
      <p>The home side also led twice as Garry Rodrigues and Ryan Mendes netted, but Edson Mexer found the first equaliser before striker Witi netted for the visitors in injury-time to secure an excellent away point.</p>
      <p>The top two nations in each pool advance to the 24-team finals scheduled to be held in Cameroon.</p>
