        <i>Phillip Galea is standing trial for allegedly plotting attacks on anarchist and socialist groups to ‘eliminate the leaders of the left’</i>
      </p>
      <p>A man accused of plotting terror attacks in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/melbourne">Melbourne</a> says his how-to document referring to “building destruction” and a “massacre” was intended to be a Monty Python-esque satire.</p>
      <p>Phillip Galea has also described himself as a self-taught electrical engineer, but insists he has never used his scientific knowledge to harm anyone.</p>
      <p>The 35-year-old expressed the sentiments while being questioned by his lawyer in his trial in the supreme court of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/victoria">Victoria</a> on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Galea has been accused of plotting attacks on Melbourne anarchist and socialist groups between August 2015 and 2016 to “eliminate the leaders of the left”.</p>
      <p>He was also allegedly working on a terror how-to document he called the “Patriot’s Cookbook”, prosecutors say.</p>
      <p>But Galea – who was associated with the far-right group <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/reclaim-australia">Reclaim Australia</a> – insists he was making a “satirical document” for people to enjoy, inspired by another “hilarious” parody book.</p>
      <p>“I intended it to be taken as a joke,” he said. “I’d intended to include disclaimers every couple of pages which would be taking the piss out of the content ... taking the piss out of everyone and everything.”</p>
      <p>Asked by his lawyer Felicity Gerry QC whether the comedy was a similar style to that of the Monty Python group, Galea said it was.</p>
      <p>“The same sort of humour, yes.”</p>
      <p>Galea told the jury he had “certainly not” actually wanted to destroy any buildings. Asked whether he had wanted a massacre, he replied “of course not”.</p>
      <p>The accused terror plotter has been in custody since his arrest in August 2016.</p>
      <p>Arson and explosive experts raided Galea’s home in November 2015 and seized five cattle prods and 362.1 grams of mercury.</p>
      <p>Computer equipment was also seized, and it’s alleged Galea researched homemade bombs, ballistic armour and guns.</p>
      <p>Under questioning, Galea spoke at length about his interest in science, describing himself as a self-taught electrical engineer who had read engineering texts dating back to the 1800s.</p>
      <p>He said he was particularly interested in the concept of “free energy” – tapping energy available in the universe – and described space as the “next step in human evolution”.</p>
      <p>Galea said he had watched every episode of Myth Busters and tried to recreate many of their experiments.</p>
      <p>He was also using the mercury found at his home to replicate an engine originally created by 19th century English scientist Michael Faraday, he said.</p>
