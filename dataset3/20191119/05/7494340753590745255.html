      <h1>Cops Put GPS Tracker On Man's Car, Charge Him With Theft For Removing It</h1>

      <p>An anonymous reader quotes a report from Ars Technica: <i>Back in 2012, the US Supreme Court <a href="https://yro.slashdot.org/story/12/01/23/1622254/supreme-court-rules-warrants-needed-for-gps-monitoring">ruled</a> that it's illegal for the police to attach a GPS tracking device to someone's car without a warrant. But what if you find a GPS tracking device on your car? Can you remove it? A little more than a year ago, the state of Indiana <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/11/man-charged-with-theft-for-removing-police-gps-tracker-from-his-car/">charged a suspected drug dealer [Derek Heuring] with theft</a> for removing a government-owned GPS tracking device from his SUV. This month, the state's Supreme Court began <a href="https://mycourts.in.gov/arguments/default.aspx?&amp;id=2421&amp;view=detail&amp;yr=&amp;when=&amp;page=1&amp;court=sup&amp;search=&amp;direction=%20ASC&amp;future=False&amp;sort=&amp;judge=&amp;county=&amp;admin=False&amp;pageSize=20">considering the case</a>, and some justices seemed skeptical of the government's argument. "I'm really struggling with how is that theft," said Justice Steven David during <a href="https://mycourts.in.gov/arguments/default.aspx?&amp;id=2421&amp;view=detail&amp;yr=&amp;when=&amp;page=1&amp;court=&amp;search=heuring&amp;direction=%20ASC&amp;future=True&amp;sort=&amp;judge=&amp;county=&amp;admin=False&amp;pageSize=20">recent oral arguments</a>. <br/><br/>At trial, Heuring's legal team argued that the search had been illegal because the police didn't have probable cause to believe their client had committed theft. The defense pointed out that the device could have fallen off the car by accident or simply malfunctioned. Even if Heuring did take the device off the vehicle, he couldn't have known for sure that it belonged to the government. It wasn't exactly labeled as the property of the Warrick County Sheriff's Office. Most important, it's not clear that taking an unwanted device off your car is theft -- even if you know who it belongs to. With the case now at the state Supreme Court, the stakes are high. If Heuring can show that the police lacked probable cause to search his house, he could get all of the evidence gathered in the search thrown out -- not only evidence of GPS device theft, but evidence of drug dealing, too.</i> In July, an appellate court ruled against Heuring, "leading to the case <a href="https://mycourts.in.gov/arguments/default.aspx?&amp;id=2421&amp;view=detail&amp;yr=&amp;when=&amp;page=1&amp;court=sup&amp;search=&amp;direction=%20ASC&amp;future=False&amp;sort=&amp;judge=&amp;county=&amp;admin=False&amp;pageSize=20">reaching the Indiana Supreme Court</a> earlier this month," the report says. "Initially, multiple justices seemed skeptical of the idea that taking a tracking device off your own car amounted to theft." <br/><br/>"If somebody wants to find me to do harm to me and it's not the police and they put a tracking device on my car and I find a tracking device and I dispose of it after stomping on it 25 times, I would hope they would not be able to go to a local prosecutor and somehow I'm getting charges filed against me for destroying someone else's property," Justice David said.</p>
