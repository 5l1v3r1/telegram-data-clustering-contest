      <h1>Honor Watch Magic 2 live image leak reveals a smartwatch with thin bezels</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T05:34:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 05:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/author/pranobmehrotra/" target="_blank">Pranob Mehrotra</a></address>
      <p>Huawei’s sub-brand Honor <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/honor-magic-2-honor-watch-magic-honor-flypods-pro-launch/">launched the first Honor Watch Magic</a> back in October last year. The original watch featured a 1.2-inch AMOLED display and packed in all the usual fitness tracking features you’d find on a premium smartwatch. Honor is prepping up to launch its next iteration at an event in China next week. While we don’t have any information on the specifications of the upcoming watch, a couple of leaked images have now surfaced online giving us our first look at its design.</p>

      <p>Unlike its predecessor, the upcoming Honor Watch Magic 2 will feature thinner bezels that don’t rise too high off the display. Honor has also opted for a monochromatic look this time around, with no red accents around the dial like the first-gen smartwatch. However, the leaked images could just be one variant of the watch, with more variants offering different color combinations. The watch straps look like they’re made of TPU, unlike its predecessor, but Honor hasn’t carried forward the red accents here either.</p>

      <p>Due to the design changes, the Honor Watch Magic 2 now looks more akin to a modern smartwatch, rather than a typical wristwatch. As mentioned earlier, we don’t have any information regarding the internal specifications of the smartwatch yet, but we expect to learn more as the launch draws closer. The Honor Watch Magic 2 will be unveiled in China on November 26, alongside the Honor V30. It’s worth noting that the flagship Honor V30 has also gone through <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=honor+v30+xda&amp;rlz=1C1GCEA_enIN875IN875&amp;oq=honor+v30+xda&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57l2j69i60.2193j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">some design changes</a> and will feature a pill-shaped hole punch cutout in the display to house the front-facing cameras. Leaked images of the device suggest that it will feature a rectangular camera module on the back with three camera sensors and an LED flash.</p>
