      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T05:25:53+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 05:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toireporter/author-K-Kumaraswamy-479220861.cms" target="_blank">K Kumaraswamy</a></address>
      <p>PUNE: Nur-Sultan, the capital city of <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a>, has emerged as the most probable venue for India's <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Davis-Cup">Davis Cup</a> tie against <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Pakistan">Pakistan</a> to be played on November 29-30.</p>
      <p>Although the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/International-Tennis-Federation">International Tennis Federation</a> was yet to issue an official statement, the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/All-India-Tennis-Association">All India Tennis Association</a> has initiated the visa process for the team members and the rest of the travelling contingent.</p>
      <p>"It could be indoor hard courts in Astana. But we cannot say anything until we receive an official communication from the International Tennis Federation," Hironmoy Chatterjee, AITA honorary secretary, said on Monday. "Our boys are used to the hard courts as they play all year around on that surface," Chatterjee added, when asked if the new venue could prompt a change in the team.</p>
      <p>Nur-Sultan, previously known as Astana, is the second largest city of Kazakhstan after Almaty, the country's former capital.</p>
