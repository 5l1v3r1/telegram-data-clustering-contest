      <h2>Halesowen singer-songwriter Rich Sewell has released his debut EP.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T05:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/leigh-sanders/" target="_blank">Leigh Sanders</a></address>
      <p>Five-track release Fade Into Black is available to hear digitally via his <a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-365417881">Soundcloud</a> page and is a collection of his previously released singles via the platform.</p>
      <p>"The EP is a combination of my songwriting from personal, political and melancholic sides of my life and outlooks," he said. "As a long-term sufferer from mental health issues, the single This Short Day depicts one of the darkest days I’ve experienced."</p>
      <p>He has also recently released a video for the track that can be viewed on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUb-K9vrhYpFgg1VoT1U99g">YouTube channel</a>.</p>
      <p>"As an unsigned artist and in full-time employment living a normal life, money is always an issue. The door was opened from a colleague and friend Chris Plant who had experience of video work. He agreed to do the video as a favour and a hobby.</p>
      <p>"Chris and I came up with the storyboard and we selected a local pub in Mosley, Birmingham, which just so happened to be Chris’ local. He managed to pull a favour and have the upstairs room for free."</p>
      <p>And Sewell says he hopes people like his hugely personal creations.</p>
      <p>"My hope for my music is to entertain people primarily but to also invoke thought behind the content," he continued. "A lot of songs can make it to ‘hit status’, but the most powerful song makes someone think and make it to 'classic status'. I’m at least hoping my music invokes thought and entertainment.</p>
      <p>"I’m constantly adding platforms for my music so please keep your eyes peeled."</p>
