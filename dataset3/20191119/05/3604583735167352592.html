      <h1>Ballarat Alstom crisis: Workers vow to rally every fortnight until state government acts</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T05:30:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 05:30</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Ford</a></address>
      <p>Alstom workers have vowed to rally every fortnight until the state government provides new on new work contracts.</p>
      <p>At a union rally in front of Wendouree MP Juliana Addison's office, a motion was passed by the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, Rail, Tram, and Bus Union, and the Electrical Trades Union demanding the state government "stop prevaricating" and give workers certainty about their jobs.</p>
      <p>The resolution notes Alstom submitted a "detailed proposal" to the state government at the end of October addressing "all relevant issues" - should the state government agree, the company would commit "that all existing full-time" employees would retain their job between the end of the existing contract and 2021, when the new contract would begin.</p>

      <p>About 60 workers, union representatives, and their supporters gathered outside Ms Addison's Lydiard Street office on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Ms Addison was not present, as she was away on parliamentary committee business in Melbourne.</p>
      <p>Her staff distributed hand-signed letters thanking workers for their attendance at the rally.</p>
      <p>"I want you to know I am well aware of the concerns and anxieties regarding the uncertainty around the future of Alstom employees here in Ballarat," she wrote.</p>
      <p>"As a former union organiser in the steel industry and national industrial officer for the printing industry, I have a strong commitment to manufacturing jobs.</p>

      <p>"As your local MP, I will continue to advocate for local jobs and our community, as the government continues to negotiate in good faith with Alstom."</p>
      <p>One of the workers who handed the resolution to the office was Luke Cornish, who also spoke at the ALP's state conference on Saturday.</p>
      <p>"It's disappointing, we're trying to get Mr Andrews to come and see us but he hasn't even contacted the shop stewards," he said.</p>
      <p>"Who knows what's going to happen at Christmas time? There's no job security, there's no job future at the moment."</p>

      <p>Ashley Mabbitt is an AMWU shop steward at the factory, and he said he's already begun to keep an eye out for other job opportunities.</p>
      <p>"There's a lot of uncertainty around and it does play on a lot of blokes' minds," he said.</p>
      <p>"Obviously, yes, we're all realists, we understand companies come and go, but we're not looking for that, we're trying to build the future here in Ballarat, build the regional jobs and make sure we keep the area strong."</p>
      <p>State AMWU secretary Tony Mavromatis said the union supported the planned rallies, adding he hoped the next one would not be necessary.</p>

      <p>"I do believe we have a decent state government at the moment with good procurement policies and good regional job policies - I'm sure they will honour that, that's why we do the rallies, to make sure they do," he said.</p>
      <p>"These contracts are never easy, but it's just been going on a little too long - we'd like to know why it's taken that long."</p>
      <p>The state government has consistently said it is assessing the design of the X'Trapolis 2.0 submitted by Alstom, and reiterated its previous commitment to building five sets of trains in Ballarat.</p>
      <p>The next rally planned is in two weeks at upper house MP Jaala Pulford's office on Dana Street.</p>
