      <p>British actor <a href="https://guardian.ng/tag/idris-elba/">Idris Elba</a> is set to star in a new all-black western Netflix film titled “Harder They Fall”.</p>
      <p>Elba would feature alongside Jonathan Majors.</p>
      <p>“Harder They Fall” follows the story of an outlaw (Majors) who embarks on a quest for vengence after he finds out that the man who killed his parents is being released from prison. Elba plays the murderer, according to Deadline.</p>
      <p>British singer-songwriter Jeymes Samuel, popularly known as Bullitts, would make his directorial debut with the film.</p>
      <p>Samuel will co-produce the film alongside JAY-Z; the two collaborated before on The Great Gatsby soundtrack.</p>
      <p>Elba also is starring in another Western drama, Concrete Cowboys, which began filming this year. In December, Elba will be seen on the big screen in Cats, the hotly anticipated film adaptation of the Broadway smash musical.</p>
