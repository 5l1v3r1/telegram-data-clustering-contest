      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T05:24:58+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 05:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/The-Hindu-Net-Desk-248/" target="_blank">The Hindu Net Desk</a></address>
      <p>The Rajya Sabha is discussing the Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2019. It passes the Jalianwala Bagh National Memorial (Amendment), Bill, 2019. The Lok Sabha discussing air pollution and climate change as a part of a discussion under rule 193, a rule that does not allow voting after the discussion. Meanwhile, the Congress has given an adjournment notice on the withdrawal of SPG protection to Rahul and Sonia Gandhi. Trinamool Congress, Republican Socialist Party and Muslim League have given adjournment notice on the JNU students’ protest and the police action following it.</p>
      <h3>Here are the live updates:</h3>
      <p>Lok Sabha | 6 p.m.</p>
      <p>Amar Singh (INC) speaks for the rural farmer, "we should understand why a farmer engages in stubble burning. He does it because he cannot afford the machines that everyone has been suggesting they use. It would cost him Rs. 5000 to Rs. 10,000 per acre, which he cannot afford."</p>
      <p>Gautam Gambhir (BJP) says we need long term, sustainable solutions and knee-jerk solutions like odd-even rule will not suffice. "Merely penalising farmers for burning stubble is not enough, we have to give them alternatives."</p>
      <p>Rajya Sabha | 5.30 p.m.</p>
      <p>Ram Gopal Jadhav (SP), who was the chairman of the Standing Committee, says that his committee, two years ago, had asked for Altruistic surrogacy to be replaced with Compensatory surrogacy. 13 major suggestion we made were not considered, but 13 minor suggentions included, he adds.</p>
      <p>Amar Patnaik (BJD) suggests changes to the Bill and says there are many lapses in the Bill that need to be relooked into.</p>
      <p>Kahkashan Perween, JD(U), opposes the waiting time of five years of marriage before availing surrogacy.</p>
      <p>K. Somprasad, CPI(M) says that although the Bill stipulates that the surrogate mother can only be a  close relative of the intending couple, no definition of close relative has been provided. He asks, "Why should the couple wait for 5 years? Fertility of the couple can be ascertained much earlier, especially with all the developments in scientic," he says.</p>
      <p>DMK opposes the Bill and asks for it to be sent to a Select Committee, says P. Wilson. He calls the Bills casteist, and says it doesn't allow for "human hybrids".</p>
      <p>Rajya Sabha | 5.00 p.m.</p>
      <p>The Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2019 is taken up for discussion.</p>
      <p>M.V. Rajeev Gowda (INC) says that we will be going back to the Victorian era by including only married couple as beneficiaries of surrogacy in the Bill. A woman's job is not inherently to give birth, so the costs that they bear should be suitably addressed. Reproductive labour of the woman should be acknowledged and the woman should be compensated, he says. He says government consent must be left out for abortion in surrogate pregnancy.</p>
      <p>Rajya Sabha | 4.50 p.m.</p>
      <p>Rajya Sabha passes the Jallianwala Bagh National Memorial (Amendment), Bill, 2019, which removes the Congress president as a trustee.</p>
      <p>The Congress chief was a permanent member of the panel. The Bill amends this to include the leader of largest Opposition party in Lok Sabha as a member. The Bill was deferred and could not be passed in the Rajya Sabha Sabha in the last session due to the absence of a broad consensus on the legislation.</p>
      <p>Lok Sabha | 4.45 p.m.</p>
      <p>Dr. Kirit Premjibhai Solanki (DMK) quotes Coleridge's Rime of the  Ancient Mariner and says "the current day version of the lines 'Water, water everywhere, all the boards did shrink, water, water everywhere not a drop to drink' would be 'air, air everywhere, polluted our lungs will shrink, air air everywhere, oxygen bars everywhere". She says air pollution is a health emergency plaguing not just parts of India, but throughout. It is a problem of posterity, a problem for the next generations, she says. It is not just an environmental issue but a health issue, she says and quotes Emerson, "we don't inherit our earth from our ancestors but borrow it from our children. Pollution is causing stunted lungs in children".</p>
      <p>Lok Sabha | 4 p.m.</p>
      <p>Pinaki Mishra (BJD) says he salutes the government to adhere to the Paris Accord, after the UPA government signed it. He asks that the government put measures in place to stop stubble burning. He also says that fireworks manufactured here are of poor quality and they contribute to air pollution as well.</p>
      <p>China has cut down on coal foundries, he says.</p>
      <p>Lok Sabha | 3.45 p.m.</p>
      <p>Manish Tewari (INC) asks why the government does not say anything about air pollution in Delhi. He says this is not just a question of air pollution, but also of our rivers, lakes and glaciers.</p>
      <p>He says it is their duty to care for the environment.</p>
      <p>Rajya Sabha | 3 p.m.</p>
      <p>K.K. Ragesh, CPI(M) says he doesn't know why the government is so eager to take control of the trust as they didn't have any role in the struggle. “Why do you want to rewrite history?” he asks.</p>
      <p>Tiruchi Siva (DMK) says the place has been transformed and there is no sense of what happened there. He says before trusteeship is changed, the government should make sure there are adequate boards and information in the site so people know history.</p>
      <p>Sukhendu Sekhar Ray is in the Chair.</p>
      <p>Swapan Dasgupta (Nominated) says there is no one alive today who participated in the events of Jallianwala Bagh. He supports the Bill.</p>
      <p>Balwinder Singh Bhunder (SAD), says what is wrong if the largest opposition party’s leader is a trustee. “Is this not a democracy?”</p>
      <p>Ritabrata Banerjee, Independent says that Tagore renounced his knighthood. He wants a statue of Tagore at the memorial.</p>
      <p>Lok Sabha | 3 p.m.</p>
      <p>House reconvenes and Zero Hour is on.</p>
      <p>Rajya Sabha | 2.30 p.m.</p>
      <p>Sukhendu Sekhar Ray of the Trinamool Congress speaks next. He says that it is not properly maintained.</p>
      <p>S. Muthukaruppan (AIADMK) supports the Bill. He is followed by Ram Gopal Yadav (SP).</p>
      <p>Prasanna Acharya (BJD) says the Congress party cannot be separated from this trust. He asks the government to be magnanimous at this time.</p>
      <p>Ram Chandra Prasad Singh, JD(U) says he supports the Bill. He says the opposition speaks about magnanimity but didn't give Bhagat Singh a Bharat Ratna.</p>
      <p>Rajya Sabha | 2 p.m.</p>
      <p>Harsh Vardhan, Minister of Health and Family Welfare, withdraws three Bills.</p>
      <p>The House takes up the Jallianwala Bagh National Memorial (Amendment) Bill, 2019 for consideration and passing.</p>
      <p>Partap Singh Bajwa (Congress) says that the party played an important role in the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. Shwet Malik of the BJP says that a memorial commemorating the freedom struggle should not be subject to politics.</p>
