      <h1>Trump's surprise hospital visit was routine, White House doctor says</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T05:39:45+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 05:39</time> by <a rel="author">Tim Stelloh </a></address>
      <p>It's wasn't any "urgent or acute issues" that sent President Donald Trump to the hospital over the weekend, the White House physician said Monday. It was for a routine interim checkup, he said, echoing comments from the president and his team.</p>
      <p>The disclosure came <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/white-house-brushes-aside-skepticism-trumps-surprise-medical-exam-n1084486">amid speculation surrounding Trump's visit Sunday to Walter Reed Medical Center</a>, which was not announced ahead of time.</p>
      <p>Unlike the president's previous two physicals, which came with advance notice and were included on his public schedule, Sunday's visit was <a href="https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1195931893998456832?s=11">announced only in a tweet</a>. Trump said he'd begun "phase one" of his yearly physical — though his last physical was in February.</p>
      <p>On Monday, the physician, Sean Conley, said in a memo that "scheduling uncertainties" had kept the visit off the record.</p>
      <p>Trump's visit with Conley lasted an hour, the doctor said. Then the president toured the hospital and spoke with the family of a soldier undergoing surgery, Conley said.</p>
      <p>"Despite some of the speculation, the president has not had any chest pain," Conley said, adding that Trump did not undergo cardiac or neurologic evaluations.</p>
      <p>Conley shared the results of Trump's cholesterol test and said he would include the president's other labs and exams in next year's report.</p>
