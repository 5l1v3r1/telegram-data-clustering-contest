      <h1>Modern slavery in Birmingham soars - and county lines is to blame</h1>
      <h2>Some 293 cases of suspected modern slavery have taken place in the West Midlands county up until September this year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T05:30:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 05:30</time> by <a rel="author">James Rodger, Michael Goodier, https://www.facebook.com/jamesrodgerjournalist</a></address>
      <p>There have been almost 300 potential victims of modern slavery in the West Midlands so far this year - and two thirds were children.</p>
      <p>New statistics published by the Home Office show that the number of modern slavery cases has continued to remain at an alarmingly high level across our county this year.</p>
      <p>Some 293 cases of suspected modern slavery have taken place in the West Midlands county up until September this year.</p>
      <p>Around 70% of those cases involved children.</p>
      <p>The National Referral Mechanism (NRM) is a framework for identifying victims of modern slavery or human trafficking and ensuring they receive the appropriate support.</p>
      <p>It is also the mechanism through which data is collected about victims, helping to build a clearer picture about the scope of the threat.</p>

      <p>Looking at cases from West Midlands Police as well as local councils, there were 86 cases in the first quarter of this year.</p>
      <p>That fell slightly to 80 between April and June, but rose to 127 between July and September.</p>
      <p>The potential victims referred to the NRM by West Midlands Police in the latest quarter included a Vietnamese woman and a Polish man in domestic servitude, 35 cases of labour exploitation involving adults and children from eight different countries, four cases of adult women and two underage girls being sexually exploited sexual exploitation, and two cases of unknown exploitation of Vietnamese men</p>
      <p>There were five British nationals exploited in the latest figures.</p>
      <p>Across the UK, 2019 has seen a dramatic rise in modern slavery cases.</p>
      <p>The number of potential victims of modern slavery referred in the first three quarters of 2019 has already surpassed the 2018 total.</p>
      <p>So far this year 7,273 people have been referred into the scheme.</p>
      <p>A total 6,993 potential victims were referred into the system in 2018, up from 5,142 in 2017, and 3,804 in 2016.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The number looks set to rise further.</p>
      <p>Between 1 July and 30 September 2019, 2,808 potential victims of modern slavery were referred to the NRM - 724 of which were UK nationals.</p>
      <p>That was up 21% on the previous three months - and up a massive 61% from July-September 2018.</p>
      <p>The rise has mainly been driven by an increase in “labour exploitation” - where people are forced to work for little or no pay.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The Home Office suggested that a rise in county lines criminal activity is behind an increase in young people being exploited for their labour.</p>
      <p>The figures for the most recent quarter also included three cases where people were referred after potentially having their organs harvested.</p>
      <p>They were a Vietnamese man, a Romanian man and a Pakistani female.</p>
      <p>In 2018 there were six cases of potential organ harvesting.</p>
