      <p>“Today, a lot of fitness enthusiasts have gathered here who have been inspired by Bhai and that includes me as well,” he said, about the packed audience at the event.</p>
      <p>Talking about his upcoming project, Aayush said: “I am going to start shooting for ‘<i>Kwatha</i>‘ very soon and the film will release next year.”</p>
      <p>Sharing a few tips about fitness, Sohail said: “I think while pursuing fitness or doing exercises, you shouldn’t have any kind of ego. I think you should lift weights as per your own capacity. One should do it in an easy and simple manner. I don’t believe in pushing myself to extremes when it comes to fitness. One should try to stay away from injuries. I lift light weights and I believe in doing high repetitions.”</p>
      <p>Talking about Salman Khan’s new venture called Being Strong Fitness, Aayush said: “We are manufacturing fitness equipment in India. I have been using these equipments for the last two years, and the quality is really good. I am proud that Salman (Khan) Bhai has come up with this new venture.”</p>
