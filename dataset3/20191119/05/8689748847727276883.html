      <p>Rapper Awal Mohammed has hit back at Fameye in a new video for dissing him on radio and telling everyone that he’s a ‘Talented Kid’ as their feud ranges on.</p>
      <p>The drama began f<a href="https://www.ghbase.com/awal-calls-fameye-fraudster-after-chopping-his-gh%C2%A2500-failing-to-show-on-set-for-video-shoot/">ew days ago,</a>when Awal revealed the ‘Nothing I Get’ hit maker charged him the said amount to shoot a music video with him but failed to honour his part of the bargain when he got the money.</p>
      <p>Fameye has responded in a brutal fashion, calling a Awal a ‘Talented Kid’ who does not deserve his attention.</p>
      <p>He said Awal is disrespectful and for someone who extended that uncouth behavior to people like Sarkodie, he’s not surprised he’s accusing him of something he knows nothing about.</p>
      <p>Fameye, whose interview was captured by Nkosuo TV, said he does not want to talk about the Awal issue because he has no dealings with him whatsoever.</p>
      <p>In a quick reply, Awal said he’s surprised Fameye can betray him in this manner whiles going about spreading lies about him relative to the subject.</p>
      <p>The rapper claimed Fameye is a very wicked person who is capable of killing a pregnant woman.</p>
