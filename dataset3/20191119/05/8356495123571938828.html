      <p>Ashley Stanley will join LockerRoom early next year as a full-time writer on women in sport.</p>
      <p>Stanley's appointment has come about thanks to a partnership with leading sports broadcaster Sky, a major supporter of our section in Newsroom dedicated to boosting the profile and coverage of Kiwi women in sport.</p>
      <p>Over the past year, Stanley has been a contributing writer to LockerRoom, profiling athletes like <u><b><a href="https://www.newsroom.co.nz/@lockerroom/2019/05/13/578679/phoenix-rises-from-tough-blow-to-lead-the-mystics">Silver Fern Phoenix Karaka</a>,<a href="https://www.newsroom.co.nz/@lockerroom/2019/06/21/645258/alysha-colletts-back-in-the-saddle-after-shocking-fall"> jockey Alysha Collett</a></b></u> and <u><b><a href="https://www.newsroom.co.nz/@lockerroom/2019/08/30/781202/banishing-the-black-dog-in-quest-for-black-jerseys">Black Fern Langi Veainu. </a></b></u></p>
      <p>While she has a passion for all sport, and is "intrigued by the personalities" of people involved in sport, Stanley has a special interest in rugby and league.</p>
      <p>For the past few years, Stanley has established her own blog, <u><b><a href="https://beyondthemark.com/">Beyond the Mark</a></b></u>, where she shares the personal achievements of athletes and administrators on top of their sporting success. She's also appeared on Sky Sport's studio panel show, Press Box. </p>
      <p>Stanley is in the process of completing her thesis for her Master of Communication Studies at the Auckland University of Technology. Her thesis topic looks at the experiences of Māori and Pacific Island rugby players within the Auckland Rugby Academy.</p>
      <p>She already has a bachelor of business from AUT and, most recently, has been working at the university as a digital communications executive. Stanley is also a mum to two children.</p>
      <p>LockerRoom looks forward to having Stanley as a crucial member of the team in 2020.</p>
