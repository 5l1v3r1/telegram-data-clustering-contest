      <h4>Deputy Education Minister Teo Nie Ching has announced that Form Four students will no longer need to choose between <a href="https://says.com/my/news/dr-marszlee-no-more-art-stream-or-science-stream-in-high-school-next-year">Science and Art streams</a> next year</h4>
      <p>Teo made the announcement yesterday while speaking to reporters at the Parliament lobby yesterday, 18 November, reported <a href="https://www.nst.com.my/news/nation/2019/11/539839/no-more-artsscience-streams-form-four-next-year">New Straits Times</a>.<br/><br/>She said a letter about the changes has already been sent to secondary schools nationwide.<br/><br/>"The letter/circular contains advice to schools across the country on how to encourage, evaluate, and explain about the new subjects available from next year," said Teo.</p>

      <h4>The current Science and Art streams will be replaced with STREAM education</h4>
      <p>According to Teo, <b>STREAM stands for Science, Technology, Reading, Art, and Music.</b><br/><br/>The new system will give students the freedom to choose whatever subjects and electives they like.</p>

      <p>Teo said Form Four students can select up to five electives along with other subjects, such as engineering, science, maths, living skills, technical studies, and a few other options which are still in the development stage.<br/><br/>"We want schools to encourage students to choose a path or stream which they are keen on, so that they will excel in that subject," Teo continued.<br/><br/>She added that the new system will be implemented based on the capabilities, availability, and suitability of facilities and infrastructure of each school.</p>
      <h4>Previously, Education Minister Dr Maszlee Malik explained that the abolition of the streaming system is to ensure no talents will go to waste</h4>

      <p>The current system segregates students based on their Form Three Assessment (PT3) results, reported New Straits Times.</p>
      <p>He said on 14 October that such a system has produced a "mismatch", preventing students from excelling in subjects they love.<br/><br/>However, he clarified later on that the Ministry of Education﻿ was not in a hurry to materialise the implementation before consulting with stakeholders and conducting proper studies on it, reported <a href="https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2019/10/21/ministry-not-ending-streaming-soon">The Star</a>.</p>
