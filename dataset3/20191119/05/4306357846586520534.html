      <h3>Mateo Kovacic says that Frank Lampard is the “perfect teacher” for the Chelsea FC squad.</h3>
      <p>The Blues have been getting used to life under their new manager after he was brought in as Maurizio Sarri’s successor at Stamford Bridge back in July.</p>
      <p>Lampard has placed his faith firmly in Chelsea FC’s young players this season, with the likes of Tammy Abraham and Mason Mount featuring regularly in the starting line-up.</p>
      <p>Chelsea FC have been in good form in recent weeks and they have won all six of their last six games in the Premier League to leave them in third place in the top-flight table.</p>
      <p>Kovacic has made one assist in 12 Premier League appearances for Chelsea FC so far this season and the midfielder has admitted that he has been delighted to learn from Lampard in recent months.</p>
      <p>Speaking in an interview with Chelsea FC’s <a href="https://www.chelseafc.com/en/news/2019/11/17/kovacic-exclusive-part-two---frank-lampard-is-the-perfect-teache">website</a>, Kovacic said: “It’s been nice, nice of course [working under Lampard].</p>
      <p>“Now I see why he was such a great player. His mentality is really strong. That’s what he wants to bring to us: to have a strong mentality, a winning mentality. He always won a lot of trophies.</p>
      <p>“He has a great connection with every player. He is a great guy, he likes to joke, he likes to laugh.</p>
      <p>“He’s the perfect teacher for us. We need to learn from him, and for now we are enjoying it, he is as well enjoying it, so it’s a nice connection.</p>
      <p>“Now the moment is good, when the tough moments come it will be a test for us and for him, but we need to keep training as we are doing. We are working really hard.</p>
      <p>“Four months he has been here, and every training was hard, and that’s important being at such a great club like Chelsea.”</p>
      <p>Chelsea FC will return to Premier League action on Saturday night with a crunch clash against Manchester City at The Etihad.</p>
      <p>Manchester City will be aiming to get back to winning ways in the top flight after they were beaten 3-1 by Liverpool FC in their most recent top-flight outing.</p>
