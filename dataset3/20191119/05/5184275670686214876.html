      <p>“She is stable and conscious,” a source said earlier, adding that she would be discharged in the next few hours.</p>
      <p>“She has an asthma problem and uses inhaler. But the problem became a bit serious on Sunday, and using inhaler was not enough. She is completely fine now,” the source told IANS.</p>
      <p>However, sources in the police hinted at medicinal overdose, referring to her medical records.</p>
      <p>According to the hospital, she was released on Monday evening after her condition improved.</p>
      <p>About speculation going around since the morning, the source close to the actor said: “We know there are such rumours, and we have already rejected them on behalf of the family.”</p>
      <p>The source said Jahan’s husband Nikhil Jain was in the hospital since Sunday night.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, the couple had celebrated Jain’s birthday. Jahan had posted on instagram a photo of their celebrations.</p>
      <p>After Jahan was admitted to the ICU, reports started floating around that she either had a drug overdose, a drug allergy or had consumed a large number of sleeping pills.</p>
