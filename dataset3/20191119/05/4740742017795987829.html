      <h1>Council takes first step towards potential new Residents' Parking Zone in Ashton and Bedminster</h1>
      <h2>Residents have said they are being forced to move away because of the parking nightmares</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T05:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author">Tristan Cork</a></address>
      <p>Council chiefs are to ask the people of one part of Bristol if they want a new Residents’ Parking Scheme, months after they already told them they did.</p>
      <p>People living in Ashton, <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/ashton-gate">Ashton Gate</a> and <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bedminster">Bedminster </a>are to be surveyed by Bristol City Council on parking issues, in what could be the first official step towards either creating a new RPZ in south Bristol, or expanding an existing one.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, a local data and research firm called RateBS3 conducted a huge survey of more than 1,200 people living in the Ashton and Bedminster area, with support for a new RPZ reaching almost three-quarters in some parts of the area.</p>
      <p>The results and the feedback shocked local councillors with <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/insanely-dangerous-parking-forcing-people-2658728">the scale of feeling on the issue</a> - some people said their lives were being made a misery by parking issues, and several people said they were having to move out and away from BS3 because of it.</p>
      <p>The survey discovered that while a lot of focus had been on issues caused by matches and events at Ashton Gate, parking was described as <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/parking-problems-bedminster-ashton-what-2230351">a ‘nightmare’ seven days a week</a>.</p>
      <p>The worst-hit places were the Victorian terraced streets in <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/ashton-gate">Ashton </a>and Bedminster that are just outside the existing <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/southville">Southville </a>RPZ, with residents reporting that the imposition of parking restrictions and permits on one side of North Street had merely pushed the problem of commuter and residents’ parking onto the other side.</p>

      <p>Four councillors from BS3 - Bedminster’s two <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> councillors and Southville’s two <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/green-party">Green councillors</a> - came together to herald the survey and say it was evidence that something needed to be done.</p>
      <p>But when Rate BS3 sent the survey results into <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-council">Bristol City Council</a>, and asked for action, they were rebuffed by <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-mayor">Bristol Mayor</a> <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/marvin-rees">Marvin Rees</a>, who told them that while they had demonstrated a strength of feeling, ‘it does not comment on the response rate and therefore doesn’t conclusively show that level of support in the area’.</p>

      <p>That left RateBS3’s Matthew Gibbs baffled.</p>
      <p>“We sent an updated report to the council in June, and it did include a response rate,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We emailed again in August, and heard nothing. We offered to workshop the date we’d received, as this was a pretty comprehensive and professionally-done survey,” he added.</p>
      <p>However, eight months after the first survey was published, which showed widespread support for an RPZ in Ashton and Bedminster, the council are to undertake their own survey of the residents of BS3, with a leaflet drop to every house urging them to go online and fill in a questionnaire about parking issues.</p>

      <p>“A survey seeking views on parking issues in parts of Southville and Bedminster, where there have been community-led requests for additional measures, is expected to be sent to residents, businesses and organisations later this month,” a Bristol City Council spokesperson said.</p>
      <p>“The responses to the survey will help to form a fuller picture and gauge the level of support for action on parking in this area,” she added.</p>
      <p>Mr Gibbs said while it was disappointing the council had not taken on board the results of the survey RateBS3 produced, at least something was finally happening.</p>
      <p>“We’ve already got the data, but now it seems the council are going to basically recommission the same survey.</p>

      <p>“It is good that they are finally doing something. If nothing else, putting all the work into a proper survey of residents’ views on parking at least has prompted the council to do the same thing again itself,” he added.</p>
      <p>The council last consulted about the existing Southville RPZ in 2017, and despite residents living in the terrace streets south of North Street in Ashton asking for it to be extended to include them, in early 2018 <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/council-extend-bristols-largest-residents-1148137">the council extended the RPZ to Saturday</a> but didn't expand the geographic area it covers.</p>
