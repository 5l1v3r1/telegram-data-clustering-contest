      <p>Bollywood superstar Akshay Kumar has signed numerous projects and is associated with tons. The actor who released the trailer of his next <i>Good Newwz</i> yesterday will also be seen in Yash Raj Films’ <i>Prithviraj</i> alongside Manushi Chillar.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile there have been rumours that the star has signed a three-film deal with the banner and the buzz went viral. It is now that the beans are spilt and the grapevine has a different story.</p>

      <p>Turns out that all the rumours were false and there is no such deal between the banner and the actor. A source close to the development told Bollywood Hungama, “There is no such deal. Yash Raj Films and Akshay Kumar have a deal for just one project which is Prithviraj. There is no three-film deal between the two.”</p>
      <p>Thus talking about the possibilities the source added, “Though there is no three-film deal between Akshay and YRF, the two could very well collaborate with each other for any future venture as standalone films if the need arises.”</p>
      <p>It was a couple of days back we saw <i>Prithviraj</i> going on floors and also the pictures from the mahurat pooja that had Manushi and Akshay in it went viral.</p>
      <p>The film is a historical drama based on the life of Samrat Prithviraj Chauhan. Directed by Chandraprakash Dwivedi the film will star Akshay as Prithviraj and Manushi as princess Sanyogita.</p>
      <p>Manushi will be making her big Bollywood debut with the project. The makers are aiming for a Diwali 2020 release.</p>
