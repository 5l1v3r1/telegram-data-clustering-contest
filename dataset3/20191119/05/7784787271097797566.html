      <h1>No stay, no pay — Mauricio Pochettino kissing goodbye to hefty cheque if he quits Spurs: Reports</h1>

      <h3>With just three top-flight wins this season, Mauricio Pochettino looks set to part ways with Tottenham anytime soon.</h3>
      <p>But while the likes of Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Manchester United continue to show interest, the Argentine may want to avoid walking out on Spurs — that’s if he’d rather get sacked for an eye-watering payout.</p>

        <b>POCH TO LOSE BIG PAY CHEQUE IF HE QUITS SPURS</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Mauricio Pochettino</b> would kiss goodbye to £12.5million (A$24m) if he walks out on Tottenham.</p>
      <p>But it is looking like the best way for him to follow his dream of managing one of Europe’s top guns.</p>
      <p><b>Bayern </b><b>Munich</b>, <b>Real </b><b>Madrid </b>and <b>Manchester </b><b>United </b>are all keen on Poch becoming their next boss and keeping their fingers crossed Spurs sack him so they do not have to pay the North Londoners more than £30m ($57m) in compensation.</p>
      <p>But Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy will only axe the Argentine as a last resort as he does not want to pay him the £12.5m ($24m) he would be due for being given the boot.</p>
      <p>Pochettino has failed to win a trophy since taking over at Tottenham in May 2014, but remains highly-rated and in-demand after guiding them to four successive top-four finishes.</p>
      <p>Spurs are 14th in the Premier League after mustering just three top-flight wins.</p>

        <b>CAN ‘UNHAPPY’ AT JUVE AMID MANCHESTER UNITED INTEREST</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Emre Can</b> admits he is still unhappy at Juventus and that “anything can happen” in his future as he continues to be linked to <b>Manchester United</b>.</p>
      <p>The former Liverpool star’s future looks totally up in the air under boss Maurizio Sarri after he was left out of the Serie A side’s 25-man Champions League squad and is yet to start for the club this season.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old Germany international has since been strongly linked with a return to the Premier League as well as a move to <b>Bayern Munich</b>.</p>
      <p>And now he appears desperate just to have some football anywhere whether that’s in Turin or not.</p>
      <p>Can said: “I’m an ambitious guy and I always want to compete at a top level.”</p>
      <p>“I am learning from this difficult moment, that everything won’t always be how I expected it to.</p>
      <p>“I haven’t even started a match and I can’t be happy, but I won’t be beaten. I will continue to work hard on myself.”</p>

        <b>BARCA REJECT RAKITIC BID FROM UNNAMED PREMIER LEAGUE SIDE</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Barcelona </b>have rejected a £13m ($25m) transfer bid from a Premier League side for playmaker <b>Ivan Rakitic</b>, Spanish reports claim.</p>
      <p>The La Liga champions are holding out for £30m ($57m) for the unhappy 31-year-old.</p>
      <p>Rakitic has been vocal about his lack of playing time at the Nou Camp this season, making just 10 appearances.</p>
      <p>Despite the player insisting he wants to remain at Barca, the club is open to selling him and according to <a href="https://www.sport-english.com/en/news/barca/barcelona-rejected-an-offer-from-a-premier-league-club-for-rakitic-7739228">Sport</a> negotiations are already underway — but an unnamed Premier League outfit were £18m ($34m) short of their asking price.</p>
      <p><b>Manchester United</b> - who face another battle to hold on to French star Paul Pogba in the winter window - have been linked with Rakitic.</p>
      <p><b>Atletico Madrid</b> as well as Italian giants <b>AC </b>and <b>Inter Milan </b>along with <b>Juventus </b>are also long-time admirers of the Croatian.</p>
