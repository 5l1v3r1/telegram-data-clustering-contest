      <p>WASHINGTON -- Donald Trump's physician says the president's unscheduled weekend visit to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center was "for a routine, planned interim checkup."</p>
      <p>Navy Cdr. Sean Conley, physician to the president, says Trump "has not had any chest pain, nor was he evaluated or treated for any urgent or acute issues."</p>
      <p>Conley adds that Trump "did not undergo any specialized cardiac or neurologic evaluations."</p>
      <p>The doctor provided few specifics but did note Trump's total cholesterol was 165 milligrams per decilitre -- considered a desirable level.</p>
      <p>Trump's unscheduled trip to Walter Reed raised suspicions about his health, despite White House officials' insistence that he was merely getting a head start on his annual physical.</p>
