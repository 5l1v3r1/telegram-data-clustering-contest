      <p>The City of Penticton is getting ready to kick off public consultations on the future of Skaha Lake Park, four years after the park's waterslide debacle <a href="https://www.castanet.net/news/Penticton/184726/no.1-skaha-park-waterslide">rocked</a> city hall. </p>
      <p>Council will hear a presentation Tuesday from staff on the creation of a new master plan for the east end of the park.</p>
      <p>“When looking at the entire park, city staff and several key stakeholders now hold the common view that any long-term planning for Skaha Park should focus on the east side,” said acting director of development services, Ben Johnson. </p>
      <p>“Much of the park is functioning well and is in good condition, however there are challenges and opportunities to explore in this part of the park, including the need for a long-term vision for the marina, aging facilities like the spray park and boat house, a desire to improve walking connections between areas of the park, and beach erosion concerns.”</p>
      <p>The city says the creation of the plan will be “informed through a public engagement process,” that will “temperature check” the public on the issue of commercial operations in parks. </p>
      <p>Primarily, the city will gauge support for the Skaha Lake Marina and what types of accompanying amenities (ie. cafe or restaurant) that the community will tolerate. </p>
      <p>The master plan will aim to create a foundation for a long-term lease at the marina, where the existing operator is entering year two of a two-year lease.</p>
      <p>The Gallagher family is <a href="https://www.castanet.net/news/Penticton/252706/new-marina-operators-local">currently operating</a> the marina after the City of Penticton paid $200,000 to exit the 29-lease with the Trio Marine Group that outraged the community.</p>
      <p>“Council is looking forward to receiving the presentation staff have prepared outlining the process by which a much needed plan for the east side of Skaha Park will be created with the public’s involvement,” said Mayor John Vassilaki.</p>
