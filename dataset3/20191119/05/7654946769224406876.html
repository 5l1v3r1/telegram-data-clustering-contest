      <p>An Upstate New York man who accidentally <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/11/17/woman-fatally-shot-as-husband-was-cleaning-gun-cops/">shot his wife dead last year</a> while cleaning his gun avoided jail time at his sentencing on Monday.</p>
      <p>Lake George teacher Eric Rosenbrock, 36, was slapped with five years probation as part of a plea deal that saw him cop to criminally negligent homicide in September for the shooting death of his wife, 36-year-old Ashley Rosenbrock.</p>
      <p>“No sentence I can impose can ever bring Ashley back to be the mother, wife and daughter that she was,” said Saratoga County Judge James Murphy as he handed down the sentence, <a href="https://poststar.com/news/local/corinth-man-sentenced-to-probation-in-shooting-of-wife/article_c0cfacf5-1553-5cea-80f9-38040fe3b5a1.html">The Post Star reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Eric, a seventh-grade science teacher, had been packing for a hunting trip on Nov. 15, 2018. He was oiling his loaded handgun when it went off, hitting Ashley, who was sitting on a couch in their Corinth home. She was struck in the torso and died of her injuries at Saratoga Hospital.</p>
      <p>The high school sweethearts had been married for 11 years and were well-known for promoting “random acts of kindness” in their community following the 2013 death of their 1-year-old daughter from an infection, according to the local paper.</p>
      <p>They also have three other children, aged 2, 5 and 10 at the time of their mother’s death.</p>
      <p>The judge said Eric had been negligent for cleaning a loaded gun inside his house while watching TV, <a href="https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Lake-George-teacher-facing-probation-in-wife-s-14843776.php">according to The Times-Union</a>.</p>
      <p>“There are far more reasonable ways of cleaning a firearm, outside the house where no one is present, away from people,” Murphy said.</p>
      <p>“These are common sense things to think about, but for some reason at the time that was not going through your head,” Murphy added. “So, unfortunately, you appear here today in this very strange circumstance, having not intended the consequences, but being held responsible for the conduct.”</p>
      <p>If he violates his probation, Eric faces up to four years in state prison. Had he not taken the plea deal and been convicted of manslaughter, he would have faced one to 15 years behind bars.</p>
      <p>He bowed his head and appeared to weep as his mother-in-law read a victim impact statement to the court, in which she described her “overwhelming sadness” but said she didn’t blame her son-in-law for the “accident.”</p>
      <p>“I am so sad Ashley and Eric’s story ended this way. It shouldn’t have,” Lorraine Tefft said.</p>
      <p>“It is beyond challenging to grieve and not add to Eric’s guilt,” Tefft added. “It is life on a balance beam and I try every day not to fall off… My world has been shattered.”</p>
