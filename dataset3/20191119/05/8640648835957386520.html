      <h1>LETTER: Review-Journal’s ‘Judging the Judges’ a good public service</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T05:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author">Miguel Reyes-Cuerva Henderson</a></address>
      <p>Sunday’s Review-Journal introduced a series that rated local judges (<a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/tag/judging-judges/">“Judging</a><a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/tag/judging-judges/"> the </a><a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/tag/judging-judges/">judges”</a>). I think this is a very good idea.</p>
      <p>Judges are elected officials who we vote for, but we really don’t know much about.</p>
      <p>I have been voting mostly based on party affiliation. But these ratings can help us vote for the right judges.</p>
      <p>After all, if you ever have to face them in the future, you would hope to get a fair judgment.</p>
