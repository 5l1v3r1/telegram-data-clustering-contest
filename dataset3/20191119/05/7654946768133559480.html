      <h1>St. John’s signee Posh Alexander nearly gave it all up</h1>

      <p>When Posh Alexander looked at his phone, motivation followed.</p>
      <p>His lock screen was of the national rankings that had dropped him from among the top-100 players in the country. When the 5-foot-11 point guard from Brooklyn didn’t want to get up early to run or put in that extra workout, it pushed him further.</p>
      <p>“It motivated me a lot,” Alexander said following a signing ceremony at Our Savior Lutheran in The Bronx, after officially joining new St. John’s <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/08/st-johns-recruiting-pattern-says-a-lot-about-mike-anderson-era/">coach Mike Anderson’s 2020 recruiting class</a> along with teammate Dylan Wusu and junior college signees Vince Cole and Isaih Moore. “It has me working harder.”</p>
      <p>Alexander, a consensus three-star guard, missed almost all of last season with a broken left arm. While he was out, he put on weight, and his status as a prospect fell. He even contemplated quitting basketball, not knowing if he could ever get back to where he was. But he worked his way back into top condition, dropping 20 pounds, and is now headed to his hometown school as its point guard of the future.</p>
      <p>“I see a different Posh,” Wusu, a physical 6-foot-4 guard said. “He’s got something to prove.”</p>
      <p>He’s gotten off to a good start this year for Our Savior Lutheran after a strong summer on the AAU circuit with the New York Lightning, showing more consistency in his jump shot. His competitive fire is one of his best qualities. Our Savior Lutheran coach Pete Wehye remembered the first time he coached Alexander back in the seventh grade. Their team was up 30 points, so he told his players to go into a zone and back up across half-court. But Alexander kept racing up court and stealing the ball. When Wehye sat him down after two warnings, Alexander responded: “I thought you were a defensive coach.”</p>
      <p>“To me, St. John’s is getting a steal,” said Our Savior Lutheran assistant coach Charles Jones, the former LIU star. “Based on his capability, intensity, tenacity, he’s a special kid. I’m just anxious to see what he’s going to become.”</p>
      <p>Alexander was the first of the four-man class to commit to St. John’s, picking the Johnnies in August. He also played a role in the commitment of Moore and Wusu, helping recruit the duo to join him, and has made an effort to connect with Moore and Cole ahead of their arrival on campus in the summer.</p>
      <p>“We got a little chemistry going on,” Alexander said. “I got them on Instagram, I looked up some of their highlights. They’re such great players.”</p>
      <p>Cole was a preseason junior college All-American selection and the 6-10 Moore’s recruitment was the highest, hearing from the likes of Arkansas, LSU, Alabama Mississippi State. Both have gotten off to terrific starts. But Alexander may be the most important of the four, because of his position and the lack of a true point guard on next year’s projected roster. The ball will be in his hands and he will be arriving with a boulder-sized chip on his shoulders.</p>
      <p>“To be honest, I think he’s better than when he was ranked,” Jones said. “It only made him hungrier.”</p>
