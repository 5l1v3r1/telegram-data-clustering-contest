      <h1>'She embodied goodness and kindness': Cheri Macaulay's dedication to community remembered</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T05:11:41+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 05:11</time> by <a rel="author">Yolande Cole</a></address>
      <p>The city has lost a major advocate with the death of longtime community champion and volunteer Cheri Macaulay, Mayor Naheed Nenshi said Monday.</p>
      <p>“Yesterday, I lost a friend, and I lost someone who was a major inspiration to me and a mentor to me,” Nenshi told reporters at city hall. “But it’s not about me. It’s about the whole community.”</p>
      <p>Nenshi said he met Macaulay 10 years ago at a meeting in a local coffee shop with people “who were interested in a better Calgary.”</p>
      <p>“Little did I know that going to that coffee would pretty much change my life, that it would lead to the creation of CivicCamp, it would lead to a movement in Calgary of people who just wanted a better city,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It’s why I’m mayor. And it’s because I met this crazy, bubbly, never-say-die woman who was just not going to let anything go. But it’s not just about politics. It is about all the things that she just did every day to build community.”</p>
      <p>One of the initiatives she was recognized for was <a href="http://www.calgaryherald.com/news/calgary/Little+Free+Libraries+unite+communities+around+love+reading/9340358/story.html">installing Calgary’s first Little Free Library in her front yard</a>. She told the Calgary Herald in 2014 that people “are really hungry for little community hubs where they can bump into each other.” She was also known to enjoy nature in the city, including a favourite grove on St. Patrick’s Island where owls had made a home.</p>
      <p>When Nenshi was first elected, he turned to Macaulay for help to encourage people to get involved in their community. As an inaugural member of Nenshi’s Civic Engagement Committee, she helped to lead the 3 Things for Calgary project, an initiative asking every citizen to do three acts of community service every year.</p>
      <p>“These little things make a huge difference,” Nenshi said. “And all of us as everyday people are inspired sometimes by extraordinary people, and she was that. So if you want to honour Cheri…do your three acts of community service every single year, and just try to make life better in small and in big ways.”</p>
      <p>Coun. Druh Farrell knew Macaulay for almost 19 years, and said her friend was “like a sister” to her. Farrell said the outpouring of tributes following the news of Macaulay’s death demonstrates how much she touched people’s lives.</p>

      <p>“Cheri had an infinite capacity to love,” Farrell said. “She was generous and kind and strong and brave and she believed in the strength of community spirit to heal. She found wonder and delight in the small things and recognized their importance in healing and well-being. The little libraries were a perfect example of how small things can transform community…She was a good listener, she had empathy, she was extremely generous with her time, and everyone she spoke with felt valued. And I will miss her every day.”</p>
      <p>Farrell questioned how the impact of someone like Macaulay can truly be measured.</p>
      <p>“She had her own gravitational force,” she said. “But she was so kind and positive, and during a time when people are so angry and hateful, she embodied goodness and kindness and generosity of spirit. And we need to demonstrate those qualities — have courage and be kind.”</p>
      <p>Farrell said Macaulay had had cancer for almost three years, and had far exceeded her prognosis. She didn’t like to think of her cancer as a battle or a journey, but as an adventure, Farrell said.</p>
      <p>And in her day-to-day world, Macaulay drew joy and wonder from the small things in life.</p>
      <p>“Feeding a chickadee, discovering her owls in St. Patrick’s Island, looking at mosses,” Farrell said. “Those little things opened a window to the world of magic.”</p>
      <p>Nenshi said ultimately, Calgary “is so much better because she was here.”</p>
      <p>“And I know that she knows that we can take it from here.”</p>
