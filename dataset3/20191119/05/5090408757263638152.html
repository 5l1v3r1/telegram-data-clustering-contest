      <p>Australia’s most populated city was covered with a thick blanket of smoke on Tuesday as bushfires in nearby regions continue to cause devastating damage to Australian communities and wildlife.</p>
      <p>A series of major wildfires have hit Australia’s eastern coastal states of New South Wales and Queensland. <a href="https://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/fire-information/fires-near-me">As of 4 p.m. local time on Tuesday</a>, there were several major bushfires burning in New South Wales, the nearest one in Gosper’s Mountain located some 200 kilometers (125 miles) from Sydney.</p>
      <p>According to the New South Wales <a href="https://www.environment.nsw.gov.au/aqms/aqi.htm">air quality control index</a>, areas in Sydney’s north-west and east reported “hazardous” levels of pollutants in the air. The government warned that conditions would be “unhealthy for sensitive people, and could cause symptoms, especially in people with heart or lung disease.”</p>
      <p>The heavy smoke made Sydney the <a href="https://www.airvisual.com/world-air-quality-ranking">12th worst city in the world for air quality</a>, behind global hubs with notoriously bad air quality like Delhi, Mumbai, and Mongolia’s capital of Ulaanbaatar.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="http://www.bom.gov.au/nsw/forecasts/sydney.shtml?ref=hdr">Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology</a>, in addition to the smokey haze, Sydney was also experiencing a heatwave with temperatures soaring to 34 degrees Celsius (93 degrees Fahrenheit).</p>
      <p><a href="http://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities/sydney-population/">Sydney is home to around 5 million people</a>, equal to roughly one-fifth of the country’s population of 25 million.</p>
      <p>Here are 13 pictures that show Sydney under siege as fires continue to rage in the distance.</p>
