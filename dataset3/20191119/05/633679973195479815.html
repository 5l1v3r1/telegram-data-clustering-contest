      <p>A former Flying Squad member from SAPS in Welkom was sentenced in the Kroonstad Magistrates Court on Monday to 60 years for a double murder.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old  Constable Diphaphang Mokwena was also sentenced to an additional 15 years for robbery.</p>
      <p>Police Spokesperson Brigadier Motantsi Makhele says Mokwena and his three co-accused went to his aunt's house in Kroonstad on the 1st of October 2018 where he asked his nephew to accompany him to the shops.</p>
      <p>His co-accused were left at the house and strangled his aunt, leaving her for dead.</p>
      <p>Makhele says when the nephew was later dropped off back at his house he found his aunt still alive and phoned Mokwena for help.</p>
      <p>He says it is then when all the accused returned to the house and slit both their throats.</p>
      <p>They then stole a TV, DVD, phone and three blankets.</p>
      <p>All three were arrested soon after the murders.</p>
      <p>The second accused Martin Sebotoane Pule, 35, was sentenced that same month to 46 years in prison.</p>
      <p>Brigadier Makhele says the third accused was poisoned and died during the trial and the case of the fourth accused is still continuing in the Kroonstad High Court.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a former KwaZulu-Natal police sergeant stationed at the VIP protection unit in Pietermaritzburg was also handed a double life sentence on Monday for the murder of his former girlfriend and her new partner. </p>
      <p>Thirty-nine-year-old Hlanganani Nxumalo was also handed five years for assault with intent, at the South Gauteng High Court. </p>
      <p>In June last year, Nxumalo drove from KwaZulu-Natal to Alexandra Township in Johannesburg, where he shot and killed his former girlfriend and her new boyfriend.</p>
