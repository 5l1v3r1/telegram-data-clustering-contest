      <p>A downtown Westbank resident is frustrated after an unwelcome guest approached his home in the early morning hours to check if his vehicle was unlocked.</p>
      <p>The culprit was caught on the family's surveillance camera, which has been in place for the past two years, thanks to previous robberies, including a thief removing a garden hose and reel from the property. </p>
      <p>The resident, who asked to remain anonymous, tells Castanet the man came onto his property in the Gossett and Brenda Lee Road area at 1:16 a.m. Sunday. </p>
      <p>“That is quite the regular occurrence around here, so I just wanted the neighbourhood and whoever (lives in) downtown Westbank here to look out for that.”</p>
      <p>The homeowner is fed up with the lack of respect for other people's property. </p>
      <p>“We’ve had people overdose on the corner of Gossett and Brenda Lee. We’ve had people pushing their belongings along the road in front of the house, sometimes leaving the shopping cart full of stuff at the end of my driveway while they went down the street. I went out there and yelled at the guy: ‘Hey come and get your crap, we don’t need that here.’”</p>
      <p>The resident says he's spoken to RCMP about thefts in the neighbourhood, but nothing could be done because of insufficient evidence. </p>
      <p>“I’ve been in this house for 14 years, and I’ve had my tire slashed, had my stereo in my car stolen, and three months later they stole the new stereo I put back in it.”</p>
      <p>His son, who visits from Alberta, also notices things go missing when he’s in town to visit.</p>
      <p>“It’s that kind of thing that’s happening down here, and it’s happening more… I just want people to know how brazen these guys are. As you can see in the second video, the guy walks out with my garden hose and reel in broad daylight.”</p>
      <p>Arrests haven’t been made, but neighbours have been warned.</p>
      <p>The newest video also shows the prowler walking across the street to another house to check their vehicle.</p>
