      <p>Steve Bruce believes Newcastle United can 'cause a problem for any team' from set-pieces after <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">the Magpies</a> hurt West Ham and Bournemouth from corners and free-kicks.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/steve-bruce">Bruce's </a>assistants, Steve Agnew and Stephen Clemence, have worked on a number of set play routines on the training ground in recent weeks and those rehearsed drills have paid off for the Magpies.</p>
      <p>One of the reasons <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/jonjo-shelvey">Jonjo Shelvey</a> came back into the team against West Ham was because of his set-piece delivery and inside 16 minutes, the playmaker's free-kick was knocked across goal by<a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/joelinton"> Joelinton</a> and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/ciaran-clark">Ciaran Clark</a> was there to put Newcastle in front.</p>
      <p>Then, six minutes later, Shelvey played a corner short to Allan Saint-Maximin who immediately turned back and fed the ball to the unmarked Jetro Willems.</p>

      <h3>Newcastle United End of Decade Series</h3>

      <p>As we head towards the year 2020, we've launched a week-long End of Decade series to mark the conclusion of a turbulent 10 years in the history of Newcastle United.</p>
      <p>Here's all the features we've run so far:</p>

      <p>The Dutchman floated a cross towards Miguel Almiron at the back post but after West Ham goalkeeper Roberto was caught in no man's land, Federico Fernandez rose highest to double the Magpies' advantage.</p>
      <p>A week later, against Bournemouth, a similar routine saw Newcastle again go short and Willems again float the ball in. This time, however, Fernandez knocked it on and Clark was there to scuff an effort past Aaron Ramsdale.</p>
      <p>Given how defenders account for 64% of Newcastle's league goals this season, Bruce, a goalscoring centre-back in his day, has certainly been pleased with how his side are hurting teams from set plays.</p>
      <p>"We've got three centre-backs and all of them have contributed, which is important," he told NUFCTV. "At set-pieces, we have big players - big 6ft 3in, 6ft 4in centre-backs - and we can cause a problem for any team."</p>
      <p>Even when a routine has not quite come off, Newcastle have made the most of having defenders further forward of late. Against Wolves last month, for example, Sean Longstaff played a corner short to Allan Saint-Maximin.</p>
      <p>The Frenchman was tackled by Jota but the Wolves player's attempted clearance only found Longstaff, who swung the ball back in.</p>
      <p>The cross was headed clear by Romain Saiss but Federico Fernandez chased it down and launched the ball back in and Jamaal Lascelles was there to meet it at the near post.</p>
      <p>There were 19 seconds between Longstaff originally taking the corner and Lascelles scoring but Newcastle made the most of getting defenders forward in that instance, too.</p>
