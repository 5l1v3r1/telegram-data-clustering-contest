      <p>Making friends as an adult can be difficult, and the Vernon Newcomers Club is hoping to change that and bring people together.</p>
      <p>Membership for the club is open for everyone aged 19 and up, and is only $25 per person until Dec 31. The membership provides access to exclusive social events like curling, virtual golf, scotch tasting and a Grey Cup party at Don Cherry's Sports Bar &amp; Grill, just to name a few. The club is also open to taking new suggestions for activities as well.</p>
      <p>"In my short time in Vernon I've met a lot of great folks, however it did take a  bit longer than I expected to feel like I 'fit' in the community," says  VNC President Jaysen Adams. "Having a social club such as the VNC helps newcomers who are eager to learn more about our new City and region, make new friends, experience the many vistas, tastes and adventures that Vernon offers, and provides an opportunity to help welcome others to Vernon in social settings."</p>
      <p>The VNC will be hosting its first social meeting on Wednesday, Nov 20 at Alexander's Pub from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. The cost of this meeting is free, but advance registration is required.</p>
