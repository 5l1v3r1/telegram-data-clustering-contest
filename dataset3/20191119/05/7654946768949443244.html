      <h1>New York man pleads guilty to making death threats against Rep. Ilhan Omar</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T05:01:36+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 05:01</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Feuerherd</a></address>
      <p>The upstate New York man who <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/04/05/ill-put-a-bullet-in-her-man-accused-of-threatening-to-kill-ilhan-omar/">called Rep. Ilhan Omar’s office</a> and threatened to shoot her after calling her a “terrorist” pleaded guilty to the crime Monday.</p>
      <p>Patrick Carlineo, 55, faces up to 10 years in prison for the March 21 threat. He’s scheduled to be sentenced on Feb. 13.</p>
      <p>Carlineo was arrested after the incident and later told federal investigators that he is a “patriot” and that he hates radical Muslims who are critical of President Trump.</p>
      <p>“He has taken responsibility for using threatening and inappropriate language to express [his] beliefs in this instance,” his lawyer said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Omar, one of the first Muslim women elected to Congress, has been the target of harsh anti-Muslim criticism.</p>
      <p>Trump has been a vocal critic of Omar, most recently calling her a “fraud” and “disgrace” at a rally in her Minnesota district.</p>
      <p>Omar’s office did not have a comment on Carlineo’s admission.</p>
