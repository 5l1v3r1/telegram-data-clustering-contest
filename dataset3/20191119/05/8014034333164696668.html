      <p>LAHORE, Pakistan — Pakistan’s ailing former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who was convicted of corruption, has left the country and is travelling to London for medical treatment.</p>
      <p>Sharif departed on a special plane on Tuesday from the city of Lahore, after a court granted him permission to leave for four weeks abroad for medical treatment.</p>
      <p>His conviction was earlier suspended for eight weeks on medical grounds.</p>
      <p>The 69-year-old Sharif was sentenced to seven years in prison on corruption charges in 2019. After his health deteriorated last month, he was rushed from his cell to a hospital in Lahore. While in hospital, he suffered a minor heart attack.</p>
      <p>Three times prime minister, Sharif was removed from office by the judiciary in 2017 over corruption allegations. He denies the charge, saying he was politically victimized.</p>
