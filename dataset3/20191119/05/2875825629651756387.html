      <p>Jer Bulsara said one of her son <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/freddie-mercury">Freddie Mercury's</a> songs in particular was too painful to hear after his death.</p>
      <p>In an interview from before her passing in 2016 aged 94, she recalled how she struggled to cope after he died in 1991.</p>
      <p>Bohemian Rhapsody and its poignant lyrics were a struggle for her she said in the rarely seen 2012 video.</p>
      <p>She said; "I went to the shops and I was very excited. They were all around the shops you know, Bohemian Rhapsody, Queen...</p>
      <p>"I got one and I was so pleased with myself that I am buying something of my son's first number 1 record. Of course, it hurts me now when I hear the song. It hurts."</p>

      <p>The song includes emotional cries of "mama" from the iconic singer - something which tugged at her heartstrings.</p>
      <p>She recalled his death but wasn't angry at losing her child so early.</p>
      <p>She said; "It was a very sad day when he died in November 1991, but according to our religion when it is the right time you cannot change it.</p>
      <p>"You have to go. God loved him more and wanted him with Him and that is what I keep in my mind.</p>

      <p>"No mother wants to see her son die, but, at the same time, he has done more for the world in his short life than many people could do in 100 years."</p>
      <p>Adam Lambert now fills the legend's sizeable shoes when he tours with Queen.</p>
      <p>The American said Freddie is “irreplaceable” but says it's an honour to represent him on stage.</p>
      <p>He said: “We’ve become a family and it’s very comfortable now.</p>

      <p>“I do have to stop and pinch myself from time to time because I realise how crazy it is that I’m part of Queen and that they’re like a family to me because these guys are icons.</p>
      <p>“I truly am grateful every time I hit the stage or sit down to a meal with them — whatever it is that happens on tour. I do stop and go, ‘Wow!’</p>
      <p>“If somebody had told 10 years ago, when I auditioned for American Idol with Bohemian Rhapsody, that I would later become their singer, I wouldn’t have believed them."</p>
