      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 19 — Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad has resumed work and seems none the worse after his nose started bleeding during a news conference this morning, his press secretary said.</p>
      <p>Endie Shazlie Akbar also said the 94-year-old was not rushed away for medical treatment as believed earlier when the nosebleed happened midway through a press conference at the MPOB International Palm Oil Congress Exhibition here.</p>
      <p>“Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad experienced a small case of nosebleed today; however, he is now well and there is nothing to worry.</p>
      <p>“He is working as usual,” Endie said in a statement.</p>
      <p>While taking questions from journalists, Dr Mahathir was seen wiping his nose with a white handkerchief. Red stains were spotted on it later.</p>
      <p>Dr Mahathir’s escorts then interrupted the press conference and ushered the PM out.</p>
