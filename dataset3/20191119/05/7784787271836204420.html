      <h1>Dylan Stephens starred for South Australia. It’s why his national carnival self-assessment seems so harsh</h1>

      <h3>If there was an award for the harshest self-critic in this year’s draft class, Dylan Stephens would be a hot favourite to win it.</h3>
      <p>Every year, AFL recruiters put a large emphasis on the Under 18 championships — an annual event where the best draft prospects go head-to-head on the national stage — to determine where players sit on the ‘draft board’.</p>
      <p>On paper, Stephens — a gun South Australian prospect — produced a promising 2019 national carnival, averaging 23.5 disposals and earning selection in the All-Australian team — all while playing through groin soreness.</p>

      <p>But for Stephens, he fell short of his own lofty standards, saying he had a few “poor games”.</p>
      <p>“I did have a little bit of a groin issue (in the middle of the year) but it wasn’t going to affect me too much,” Stephens told <i>foxfooty.com.au</i>.</p>
      <p>“I wasn’t training throughout the championships because I was trying to rest my groins. Coming down from League level maybe it took a bit of adapting to do. I wanted to be on the inside and I was out on a wing and a lot of the time I wasn’t involved with the play as you can be with a wingman.</p>
      <p>“I think that happens in footy. Prior to that, I hadn’t really played any poor games so I was probably due and I got them all in one section and it was pretty frustrating.”</p>
      <p>Still, Stephens was in no panic, particularly after he witnessed a fellow South Australian struggle through the 2018 champs then star in his debut AFL season.</p>

      <p>Connor Rozee had a subpar championships campaign in 2018, averaging 13.3 disposals while playing in multiple positions. Months later, he took the AFL by storm by booting 29 goals in 2019 for Port Adelaide.</p>
      <p>“I was aware of (Connor struggling) and coming to the finals series and knowing the finals series he had last year (was very good), I knew how much (good) footy was ahead of me. (I) just put it behind me and I was ready to attack the end of the year,” Stephens said.</p>
      <p>Stephens bounced back from his carnival with impressive outings for Norwood in the SANFL League, playing 13 games of senior football in, including a best performance of 26 disposals and eight tackles against North Adelaide.</p>
      <p>The 18-year-old then took part in the reserves grand final and ended his year on a high.</p>
      <p>“One person I actually spoke to was Ned McHenry just after the champs and he said from the championships period to the end of the year to the draft it is a bit of a drag,” he said.</p>
      <p>“So just enjoy the games you get with your club before it could all change and he said to make the most of it.</p>
      <p>“To get the opportunity to play 13 games or whatever it was and a Grand Final in Reserves, I was pretty happy with that. I had a patch during the championships where I wasn’t playing my best footy.</p>
      <p>“I was pretty proud after the championships when my confidence was down to string a good month of footy together straight after that, I’m really happy with that.”</p>

      <p>Stephens might be considered a South Australian to some, but deep down his roots are in his hometown back in Victoria.</p>
      <p>“I was playing footy in Red Cliffs, my hometown back in Victoria, I was lucky enough to have a pretty good year and won the league medal in Under 13s,” he explained.</p>
      <p>“I got a phone call probably about three weeks before school was about to start and got offered to go to St Peter’s (College) in Adelaide. I didn’t even know what boarding school was at that time but it took a bit of thinking. It was Year 9 and I went straight over there.</p>
      <p>“It was very daunting and I remember going on a tour in the summer at the end of the year before. It was a tour of the whole school and I did not say a word the whole day. I was with my parents and I was so overwhelmed with the whole thing.”</p>

      <p>Moving away from friends and family doesn’t worry Stephens, who already has eyes on a potential home if he moves to his third state.</p>
      <p>The smooth moving midfielder has been linked with Carlton (Pick 9), Hawthorn (Pick 11) and Port Adelaide (Pick 12) — but is none the wiser as to who may call his name out on draft night.</p>
      <p>“If it is Sydney for example, I’ve got Will Hayward (who) I went to St Peter’s with,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I spoke to him on the phone and he said ‘I’ve got a spare room in my apartment with Ollie Florent’.</p>
      <p>“West Coast said you can come to a host family and (chose) whether that is on the beach or suburban. They really look after you.”</p>
