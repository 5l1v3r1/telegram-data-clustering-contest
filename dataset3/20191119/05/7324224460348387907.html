      <p>"It’s due to be a big event," he told The Star, "with support coming from Wolverhampton newcomers Pool [another former Unsigned column act], the very exciting 11 57 and new Derby dreamboats Closed Curtains.</p>
      <p>"They’ll be a DJ set from Brum indie royalty - to be announced soon - and some very, very special guests during the headline set. Plus, I’ll be debuting the entirety of my unreleased second EP."</p>
      <p>Having already supported the likes of The Rhythm Method and playing stages such as the BBC Introducing stage at Worcester Music Festival, The New Consistent has been making waves on the underground circuit.</p>
      <p>"One hell of a party is promised," The New Consistent, real name Benjamin Ramsay, added.</p>
      <p>Tickets are £7 and are available from <a href="https://www.seetickets.com/event/the-new-consistent/the-sunflower-lounge/1449009">SeeTickets</a>.</p>
