      <h1>All the amazing things in Liverpool supported by the National Lottery</h1>
      <h2>Some of the city's greatest landmarks have benefited from major funding</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T05:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author">Cheryl Mullin</a></address>
      <p>It’s been 25 years since the first National Lottery draw.</p>
      <p>Since then more than £3.3 billion has been invested into more than 46,000 good causes in the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">North West</a>, thanks to <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/lottery-winners-reveal-what-winnings-17271417">National Lottery players</a> – the equivalent of £400,000 per day.</p>
      <p>To celebrate this fact, Ruby Taylor has created a <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/top-10-cities-most-lottery-17250499">stunning map highlighting</a> some of the key projects and places in the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/">region</a> that have thrived thanks to National Lottery funding.</p>
      <p>It’s part of a series of nine maps covering each region in England. Together they show many of the projects The National Lottery has helped fund over the past 25 years, demonstrating the scale, impact, and breadth of funding in England.</p>

      <p>Some of the places showcased include Tate Liverpool, the Merseyside Maritime Museum, and the International Slavery Museum, all at the city’s Pier Head,</p>
      <p>Further afield there’s Manchester’s Lowry Centre, Jodrell Bank Discovery Centre, and Hadrian’s Wall, which have all been supported by the National Lottery Heritage Fund.</p>
      <p>Over the past 25 years, The National Lottery has invested £647 million into sport across the North West.</p>
      <p>Dawn Austwick, Chief Executive of The National Lottery Community Fund, said:</p>

      <p>“Twenty-five years ago, saw the advent of The National Lottery – today we’re celebrating what is now a national treasure. The money raised for good causes has helped millions of us follow our passions, find a voice and thrive. Whether through art, sport, community, heritage or film, our lives have been touched and changed - thanks to National Lottery players we are all winners.”</p>
      <p>Ruby’s beautiful illustrations are a visual reminder of just how much of an impact The National Lottery has had on people and places across the nation.</p>
      <p>Ruby says: “I am thrilled to have been asked to design these maps for The National Lottery’s 25th Birthday. It’s easy to forget just how much of an impact the money from National Lottery players has on our local communities.</p>
      <p>"It was great fun drawing both well known buildings and hidden gems, and I hope that people recognise places that matter to them.”</p>
      <p>The National Lottery has also released a star-studded film inspired by Monty Python entitled ‘What has The National Lottery ever done for us?’.</p>
      <p>Starring Jimmy Carr, you can watch the mini movie on YouTube.</p>
