        <b>A new triage process has helped a struggling mental health service slash its waiting list by 30 per cent in four months.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Birmingham Women’s and Children’s Foundation Trust, which runs Forward Thinking Birmingham, told <i>HSJ</i> the number of patients waiting to access its 0-25 community health services has dramatically reduced since the summer.</p>
      <p>The service is one of the first models of its kind in England. In most areas of the country, children’s mental health services are offered up to 18 years old, but FTB was launched in 2016-17 to care for young people up to the age of 25.</p>
      <p>However, various problems with the service have been highlighted since its launch, including <a href="https://www.hsj.co.uk/quality-and-performance/gaps-in-unique-service-criticised-after-patient-death/7024155.article">several patient deaths</a> and an “inadequate” rating from the Care Quality Commission in February 2018.</p>
      <p>The service’s growing waiting list for secondary care has been a particular concern. This June, it reached an all-time high of 1,751 patients.</p>
      <p>But, by employing more senior clinicians to triage patients at the point of referral, the trust said it has been able to send a significant number to more appropriate community services. The proportion of patients being referred to Improving Access to Psychological Therapy services has risen significantly.</p>
      <p>A 10 per cent increase to community services funding from commissioners in 2018-19 appears to have also helped, although there are still concerns about the funding levels.</p>
      <p>Despite the funding increase for the 2018-19 budget, a coroner subsequently warned the trust and Birmingham and Solihull Clinical Commissioning Group in October 2018 that the services were underfunded. This was also acknowledged in a response from the trust’s medical director Fiona Reynolds.</p>
      <p>The trust said the waiting list now stands at just over 1,100 and, earlier this month, the CQC <a href="https://www.hsj.co.uk/quality-and-performance/trust-rated-good-two-years-after-merger/7026366.article">upgraded the service to “requires improvement”</a>.</p>
      <p>Originally the service was commissioned to provide services for 12,000 referrals a year. But, in 2018-19, referrals to the service reached 16,442. Halfway through the current year, they stood at 9,598.</p>
      <p>The trust is also responsible for inpatient services, but claimed it could not provide waiting list numbers because the service is commissioned by NHS England.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the trust’s overall CQC rating earlier this week, chief executive Sarah-Jane Marsh said: “We’ve been working hard and lots of things have improved, but it’s going to take years and years to try and get everything up to the level of the best potential for each service.”</p>

      <p>FTB, launched in 2016, is a consortium run by Birmingham Women’s and Children’s Hospital FT. It is responsible for providing secondary care community mental health care for 0-25-year olds.</p>
      <p>Current partners include 10 non-NHS organisations, which deliver talking therapies to 14-25-year olds, private provider Helios which runs online assessments and therapies, Beacon UK and The Children’s Society.</p>
      <p>The Priory Group are also partners, providing tier four inpatient beds. Worcestershire Health and Care Trust withdrew from the service in April 2018.</p>
