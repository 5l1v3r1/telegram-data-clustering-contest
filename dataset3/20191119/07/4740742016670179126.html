      <p>The iconic Brabazon hangars have been a part of Bristol's heritage since the 1940s.</p>
      <p>But almost 70 years since it was first built following <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/history/">the Second World War</a> many Bristolians have probably never stepped foot inside.</p>
      <p>Most of us will know of someone - mother, father, grandfather - who would have worked at the hangars in the six decades it was operational.</p>
      <p>Built in 1946 for the construction of the Brabazon airliner, the building later became the birthplace of <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/filton-airfield-hangar-restored-thanks-2393061">Concorde.</a></p>

      <p>It had been empty since 2009 but could soon be <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/another-year-still-no-closer-2312177">welcoming tens of thousands of visitors</a> at once if plans to transform the hangar into a 17,000-seat arena are approved.</p>
      <p>Malaysian investment firm YTL revealed its vision for an arena at the site <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/filton">in Filton</a> last year and has now <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/filton-arena-plans-ytl-bristol-3551372">submitted a planning application to Bristol City Council.</a></p>

      <p>YTL has promised to deliver a “world class venue for Bristol” which it says could rival London’s O2 and Birmingham’s NEC in terms of <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink/">restaurants</a>, concessions, clubs and bars.</p>
      <p>Spanning a whopping 26 acres, the three interlinked hangars are one of the largest continuous footprints in Europe and could comfortably fit London’s O2 Arena within its walls.</p>
      <p>The 352m-long and 35m-tall building has an enclosed volume of some one million cubic metres divided up into three separate aircraft hangars.</p>

      <p>It was originally built to allow for the construction of the Bristol Type 167 Brabazon airliner with each separate hangar home to fabrication, assembly and testing of the aircraft.</p>
      <p>Despite the Brabazon Mark I achieving its aim of being the largest civil aeroplane in the world, with a wingspan of 230ft, it never found <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/business/">commercial success.</a></p>
      <p>But that did not mark the end of the building's huge significance to British and <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/history/aerospace-bristol-fantastic-pictures-show-661268">Bristol’s aviation history</a> as it was later used to construct Concorde.</p>
      <p>Regardless of whether an arena is eventually built within the hangers, they will still form part of the new Brabazon neighbourhood which will see more than 2,500 new homes, schools, a high street and parks built over the coming decade.</p>
