      <p>The acting Permanent Secretary of the Benue State Ministry of Science and Technology Sekegh Akaa was burnt to death alongside his pregnant wife and two children when a fire engulfed their Kwararafa Quarter home  in  Makurdi in the  early hours of Monday.</p>
      <p>According to an eyewitness, the fire began  around  2.45am.</p>
      <p>The  real cause of the fire could not be ascertained as of the time of filing this report, but a    neighbour, who simply identified herself as Josephine,  told our correspondent that it might  have been   caused by an electrical fault.</p>
      <p>The fire  razed the entire house and extended to three other houses including that of the Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on  Religion Daniel Unongo.</p>
      <p>Although firefighters  fought hard to put out the fire and to save lives, the inferno  raged on for a long time.</p>
      <p>Josephine said,   “Initially, when I heard of the cry of the woman in it took me sometime to muster courage to go out because I thought  robbers had attacked the house.</p>
      <p> “When I came out and saw a thick smoke from the same house,  I shouted and this drew attention  of other neighbours to what was going on.</p>
      <p>“Immediately, one of the neighbours  made a phone call to the fire service and within a short time they  rushed to the scene.”</p>
      <p>The Deputy Governor Benson Abounu, who visited the scene, expressed his shock  at the incident, describing it as a monumental disaster.</p>
      <p>Abounu said the state had lost a prized asset in Akaa and prayed God to give the family the fortitude to bear the  loss.</p>
      <p>He said, “We cannot undo what has happened. At the moment,  the government will take responsibility for their burial and also assist the other families who lost property to relocate.”</p>
      <p>the late permanent secretary’s brother Rev Favour Akaa said  they attended a retreat at ECWA Church in Makurdi at the weekend.</p>
      <p>He said he  had a conversation with his brother on  Sunday  night  about a certain transaction he was scheduled to do on Monday but preferred to do it on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Favour said, “He told me that his heart could not rest until he had done the transaction. It is a wonderful thing to spend 48 hours with God. His death is  strength to us. It is time for him to depart and we give glory to God.”</p>
      <p>It  was learnt  that Akaa was due to be confirmed as Permanent Secretary  before his death.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Governor  Samuel Ortom  has said he is saddened by Akaa’s death According to a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Terver Akase, the  governor  consoled  the deceased’s friends and relations.</p>
