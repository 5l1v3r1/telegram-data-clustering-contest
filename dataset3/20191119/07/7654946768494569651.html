      <p>OKLAHOMA CITY â€” Authorities say a teenager broke both his legs after leaping from an Oklahoma City airport terminal roof while being chased by officers.</p>
      <p>An Oklahoma City police statement says the 16-year-old male was exiting a Houston-to-Oklahoma City flight at Will Rogers World Airport when police approached with a felony burglary warrant.

      <p>As officers continued their pursuit across the roof, police say, the teen jumped to the apron below, breaking both legs. He was taken to an Oklahoma City hospital for treatment.</p>
