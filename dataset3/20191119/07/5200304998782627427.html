      <p>Parth Samthaan and Erica Fernandes’ professional relationship made headlines when many reported that the ‘Kasautii Zindagii Kay 2’ (Star Plus) stars were not cordial with each other. While speaking about his co-stars Samthaan said that work arguments happen but he and Fernandes are still good friends.</p>
      <p>Samthaan revealed, “We are good friends and friendly even today. We are in a good space. We work together daily on our TV serial and things are smooth between us. At times, there are some arguments or differences of opinions at work, but this is normal. In fact, recently, the cast came over to my new house and we all chilled together. I am not even aware of most of these so-called rumours, so we don’t need to deal with it.”</p>
      <p>‘Kasautii Zindagii Kay 2’ is produced by Ekta Kapoor.</p>
