      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/lionel-messi/">Lionel Messi</a> and Edinson Cavani clashed during Argentina’s 2-2 draw with Uruguay with the Paris Saint-Germain striker reportedly offering to fight <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/fc-barcelona/">Barcelona</a>’s talisman.</p>
      <p>The flashpoint occurred towards the end the first half of Monday night’s friendly in Israel after Messi was fouled.</p>
      <p>Cavani approached Messi after he was brought down and the two players began exchanging words.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.ole.com.ar/futbol-internacional/messi-cavani-seleccion_0_Yn3VdWgR.html">Ole</a>, Cavani offered to fight Messi and the Barcelona forward replied: ‘Whenever you want.’</p>
      <p>The pair had to be separated by several players, while Uruguay defender Diego Godin attempted to diffuse the situation by putting his arm around Messi.</p>
