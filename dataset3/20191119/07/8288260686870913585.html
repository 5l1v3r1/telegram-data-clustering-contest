      <h2>Wolverhampton Wanderers transfer news | BirminghamLive gets the inside track on Wolves target Aurelio Buta</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T07:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Dicken, https://www.facebook.com/alexdickenjournalist/?fref=ts</a></address>
      <p>Wolverhampton Wanderers are tracking ‘one of the best full-backs’ in Belgium ahead of the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>The man in question, Aurelio Buta, has been scouted in the last six months with <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> looking to identify a potential competitor for Matt Doherty.</p>
      <p>Buta is currently on the books of Royal Antwerp where he’s made quite a name for himself since quitting Benfica.</p>
      <p>“He’s been playing for a couple of years in Belgium after coming from Benfica’s B team,” <a href="https://twitter.com/asternzey">says Sporza’s Aster Nzeyimana.</a> “He’s one of the best full-backs in the Belgium league - that’s a widespread opinion.”</p>

      <p>Buta, who was born in Angola before choosing to represent Portugal at youth level, joined Antwerp shortly after they were promoted to the Belgian top flight in 2017.</p>
      <p>He’s made 43 league starts for Antwerp and started their Europa League qualifiers with Viktoria Plzen and AZ Alkmaar in August, although he was sent off against the latter.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Antwerp is one of the biggest clubs in Belgium with a big fanbase,” Nzeyimana explains. “Their promotion to the first league was hugely anticipated and Aurelio Buta was one of the signings they made and he’s really grown with the squad.</p>
      <p>“It was a bit like Wolves. They were immediately up there, quality wise, with the better sides in Belgium. He was a very promising player and we immediately knew that.</p>
      <p>“In the last two years he’s grown defensively, he has admitted that himself. He’s quite a small player but he’s technically very gifted. We have a history in Belgium of good attacking full-backs and he really fits right in. He’s instrumental to Antwerp.”</p>

      <p>When Buta is fit, Antwerp manager László Bölöni includes him in his starting XI - but the 22-year-old has missed the climax in each of the last two campaigns due to injury.</p>
      <p>“The drawback of him is that he’s quite injury prone - he’s missed larged parts of the season,” says Nzeyimana. “He’s quite regularly injured. They play with four at the back at Antwerp and he’s the one on the right.</p>
      <p>“Wolves wise, he would definitely be a good wing-back. He’s too small to play at centre-back.”</p>

      <p>Belgium’s top flight has often been used as a stepping stone for players to realise their Premier League dreams and Buta is no different.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> recruited superbly in the form of Leander Dendoncker - but there have been several cases of players from Belgium not making the grade in England, which is why Nzeyimana sits on the fence when asked whether Buta would be well suited to the Premier League.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>He said: “We have this business model where players come from around the world to make the step towards the Premier League.</p>
      <p>“If you look at (Brighton’s Leandro) Trossard, I had my doubts about him in the Premier League. My doubts (about Buta) are physique wise, his body, he’s injury prone.</p>
      <p>“Technically? Definitely. Wolves play good football so there’s a chance that he succeeds - but I have my reservations</p>
      <p>“It wouldn’t be a big deal for Antwerp. They could sell him for five or ten million and everyone would be happy. If they can sell him, they’ll sell him.”</p>
