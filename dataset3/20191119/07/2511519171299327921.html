      <h2><b>Ireland 1-1 Denmark:</b> Mick McCarthy’s side will have to go through the play-offs to make it to Euro 2020</h2>

      <p>It was, like so many Irish attacks against <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/denmark-football">Denmark</a>, so predictable.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ireland-football">Ireland</a>, as expected, end up in the play-offs. That makes it their ninth involvement in such deciders since the route was properly reintroduced for any Uefa qualifying campaign back before Euro 96, which is - remarkably - three more than any other European nation. It is their natural habitat, and something quite respectable for a country that size.</p>
      <p>And that, of course, was confirmed by a 1-1 draw. It is their natural scoreline.</p>
      <p>The country’s entire modern football history revolves around 1-1s. So many of the great successes and great disappointments involve one, virtually every campaign has one.</p>
      <p>Go right back to the country’s football rebirth with that debut qualification for Euro 88. There was a decisive 1-1 with USSR, before two in Italia 90 against England and the Netherlands respectively. It was a controversial and politically-charged 1-1 with Northern Ireland - but a 1-1 nonetheless - that secured passage to USA 94, and then three 1-1s in the post-Saipan 2002 World Cup, the last of which brought a penalty shoot-out defeat to Spain. The Thierry Henry handball ensured that infamous play-off with France ended 1-1, and it was a series of 1-1s that smoothed passage to Euro 2012, with Euro 2016 similarly opening with one against Sweden.</p>
      <p>And here we are again, a 1-1 with Denmark sending Ireland back to a play-off.</p>
      <p>It in its own way says much about the very state of the football culture as a whole. Ireland are a country who have consistently been competitive, but usually struggle to really make the breakthrough, and it often feels like a more reactive mode of football is more geared towards defiantly holding their ground rather than looking to open out and play.</p>
      <p>Hence the “moral victory” of 1-1 draws seems to suit the entire set-up, representing fair reward for the effort, but reflecting how they didn’t do enough to actually win. That so many involve the Irish being the side to equalise only accentuates that.</p>
      <p>So it was in this latest 1-1 with Denmark.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Against a flat-looking side that had appeared there for the taking, a relatively limited Ireland team gamely fought on through some fairly one-dimensional attacks, only really coming alive after going behind. The late Matt Doherty goal - with 85th-minute equalisers themselves becoming a bit of a trend - of course came through a cross and header, that had developed from a set-piece.</p>
      <p>It was, again, all so predictable - right down to the third place in the group.</p>
      <p>Ireland again perform to par, which is precisely what a 1-1 is.</p>
      <p>And yet for all the fair comment about the limited level of this Irish side under Mick McCarthy - himself involved in more of these 1-1s as a player and manager than anyone else - it still feels somewhat frustrating, as if more might be possible.</p>
      <p>That is because this entire campaign comes at a crossroads for Irish football, that has almost been symbolised by the forced departure of controversial former chief executive John Delaney.</p>
      <p>It was Delaney himself that came up with this halfway-house managerial idea at that crossroads.</p>
      <p>With the departure of a similarly reactive manager in Martin O’Neill last year, much of Irish football were crying out for a more progressive and modern choice in repeat domestic title-winner Stephen Kenny. Delaney was prepared to give it to him - but only after a fashion. The former CEO was desperate to ensure Ireland qualified for a Euro 2020 they will partly host - and which he saw as something of a personal achievement - so decided to give McCarthy a two-year deal before Kenny takes over next year, on the basis that the former is a “surer thing”. It is the 1-1 draw of managerial decisions.</p>

      </figure>
      <p> </p>
      <p>And while McCarthy does indeed have an admirable record for making Ireland sure challengers for any opposition, the complication this time is that the country suddenly have a hugely promising group of young talent coming through - spearheaded by Troy Parrott - to go with changes in the way the international game is played.</p>
      <p>Kenny is better suited to bringing through that talent, but the eternal question will be whether they should have gone through with his appointment earlier.</p>
      <p>Ireland decided against that, on the basis of a short-term decision. It is admittedly a very big short-term decision, given the stakes involved in actually qualifying in a competition you are hosting - but that is still another modern trend in Irish football to go with 1-1 draws and play-offs. It is partly why the 1-1 draws and play-offs have been such trends. Because of always thinking about the short-term. Because Irish managers and teams have mostly sought to quickly cut the cloth to match, rather than seeking to build something more expansive.</p>
      <p>It of course means repeated Irish side are admirably competitive, and remarkably consistent. Nine play-offs in 12 campaigns is nothing to be sniffed for a country of that size. Scotland, for one, would envy such opportunities.</p>
      <p>It’s just that - yes, like a lot of the football - it’s all rather predictable. More patience, and more vision, might allow more.</p>
      <p>But then that’s what’s to come after this campaign. And there’s the hope of yet another play-off before then.</p>
      <p>Could be better. Could be a lot worse. Much like a 1-1 draw.</p>
