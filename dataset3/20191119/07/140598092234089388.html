      <h1>Exclusive: Sport leaders unite over PE 'alarming public health emergency'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T07:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/jeremy-wilson/" target="_blank">Jeremy Wilson</a></address>
      <p>A coalition of more than 40 leaders from across British sport have written to the main political parties to request a public commitment to tackle the “alarming public health emergency” of inactivity among young people.</p>
      <p>The open letter, published on Tuesday, has been signed by the chief executives of major sports governing bodies and charities, including the Football Association, the English Cricket Board, England Athletics, the Lawn Tennis Association and the Youth Sports Trust.</p>
      <p>It specifically urges Boris Johnson, Jeremy Corbyn and the other party leaders to outline measurable plans which will ensure that every young person “enjoys an hour a day of sport and physical activity, backed up by good quality teacher training and investment in school sport facilities”.</p>
      <p>The letter asserts that the wellbeing of young people across the United Kingdom is in decline and says that they are increasingly missing out on the benefits of sport and play. “We believe that the inactivity of young people, and the associated problems this is posing for their physical and mental health and wellbeing, is nothing short of a public health emergency,” say the sports leaders.</p>
      <p>“Too many are growing up overweight, obese, unhappy, lost and lonely. Only one in five young people is active for 60 minutes every day and physical education is being squeezed from the timetable in many secondary schools.</p>
      <p>"We ask for your public commitment during this General Election campaign that, should your party form the next government, you would set out a long-term, bold and measurable plan.”</p>
      <p>Just eight per cent of girls and 16 per cent of boys aged between 11 and 18 are currently meeting guidelines set by the British Medical Officer of an hour of physical activity each day. A third of children are even doing less than 30 minutes of activity a day. Research has also showed that 38 per cent of secondary schools have cut their PE time in the last five years for children aged between 14 and 16 amid the pressure of exams. </p>
      <p><i>The Telegraph</i> launched its <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/womens-sport/2019/07/13/exclusive-telegraph-campaign-credited-helping-ensure-girls-experience/">Girls, Inspired campaign</a> earlier this year to close the gender gap and tackle the crisis of inactivity among girls. It specifically called on the Government to support schools in <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/school-sport/2019/04/02/telegraphs-girls-inspired-campaign-explained/">three key aims</a>: To ensure an equality of opportunity to access sports; new guidelines, enforced by Ofsted, which put PE on a par with core subjects and for schools to empower girls by offering a wider and more innovative choice of activities.</p>
      <p>The Government launched its School Sport and Activity Action Plan in July and, having specifically referenced the inspiration provided by The Telegraph’s campaign, pledged new funds for teaching training and a range of measures to modernise PE, engage girls and make physical activity a core part of the school day. Ofsted also promised that those schools who offer extracurricular activities and opportunities to get active will be rewarded in their inspections.</p>
      <p>The plan was a cause for considerable optimism but sports leaders now want to ensure that the momentum is maximised and tangible change is urgently implemented.</p>
      <p>New sports minister Nigel Adams has told The Telegraph that he would like to see up to five hours of sport every week inside schools and that he wants to make sport and activity a mandatory part of the week. Private schools generally offer around four hours of PE per week but also extensive extracurricular activities.</p>
      <p>The recommended minimum guidance is two hours of PE per week in state schools but The Telegraph has been made aware of schools where PE has been reduced even since the publication of the School Sport and Activity Action Plan.</p>
