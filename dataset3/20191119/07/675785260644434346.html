      <p>Burglars scaled the outside of a mansion to break in and steal £1million worth of jewellery while a mum and her children were inside.</p>
      <p>The intruders entered the family home in Hampstead Lane, Hampstead, through a first floor window before making off with the jewellery, designer clothing and a substantial amount of cash.</p>
      <p>The woman in her 30s and her children were at home during the raid which took place on November 14 at around 5pm.</p>
      <p>Police are appealing for information and have released images of some of the stolen jewellery.</p>
      <p>Detective Inspector Paul Ridley, who is leading the investigation, said: "Burglary is an extremely intrusive crime and the effect is often compounded further when the occupants are at home.</p>

      <p>"This is an aggravating feature of this case as the victim was present with her young children when the burglars have forced entry, scaling the wall of the mansion and brazenly ransacking the premises.</p>
      <p>"I am releasing images of some of the items that were stolen and are of huge sentimental value to the victim.</p>

      <p>"Many of of these are very distinctive and rare including the necklace, ring and earrings.</p>
      <p>"I would ask anyone who has been offered this jewellery, including private collectors or jeweller's; or seen these items for sale anywhere to report it to us immediately."</p>
