      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/halsey/">Halsey</a>’s definitely not pregnant, she’s just allergic to gluten.</p>
      <p>The singer, 25, took to Twitter to shut down claims she was pregnant with new boyfriend Evan Peters’ baby after photos of him touching her stomach got fans talking.</p>
      <p>The couple were photographed out together over the weekend, but the shot that got everyone talking was of Halsey cradling her stomach as Evan, 32, also laid a hand on her tummy.</p>
      <p>Fans were quick to jump to the conclusion that the pair were expecting, despite it being a pretty new relationship… but it seems like it was just an ill-advised pancake to blame for all the excitement.</p>
      <p>Halsey took to Twitter to set the record straight, telling fans: ‘Still not pregnant. Still just allergic to gluten. Still love pancakes.’</p>
      <p>She added: ‘Is it a boy? Is it a girl? It’s pancakes.’</p>

      <p>Halsey and Evan have been dating since October, after she and British singer Yungblud split up after around a year of dating.</p>

      <p>She confirmed her new relationship on the Ellen DeGeneres show, admitting: ‘I don’t know what’s scarier though … having to talk about my boyfriend on TV or [having a member of the crew jump out of a box at her]? It was a double whammy.’</p>
      <p>The couple then went Instagram official with a photo of them in matching couples costumes for Halloween as they dressed up as Sonny and Cher.</p>

      <p>She later posted: ‘People think my last tweet is me hinting I’m pregnant, which means I’m either: a. Gaining weight B. Acting weird than usual. Jokes on u, I’m doing BOTH! However STILL not pregnant!’</p>
      <p>Halsey has previously spoken about wanting to have children, admitting in July 2018 that she wouldn’t say no to having a child once her tour was over.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘Once the tour is over, I feel like anything could happen. I could decide I want to move to Italy for a year and write. I could get pregnant.</p>

      <p>‘I finally have enough stability in my career where I can take a breath. I feel like I can let life happen.’</p>
      <p>She has also admitted to having three miscarriages in the past and four surgeries to combat the near-constant pain of endometriosis.</p>
