      <h1>China's H-20 Stealth Bomber: The Biggest Threat to the U.S. Military?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T07:55:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 07:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://nationalinterest.org/" target="_blank">Mark Episkopos</a></address>
      <p>The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff <a href="https://www.stripes.com/news/pacific/milley-declares-pacific-top-us-military-priority-in-first-overseas-trip-as-joint-chiefs-chairman-1.607392">reaffirmed </a>the strategic importance of the Pacific late last week, calling it “the no. 1 regional priority for the United States military.” China People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF), however, is forging ahead with a long-range strike bomber that threatens to hamstring U.S. military’s ability to project power in the region.</p>
      <p>Early reports that the PLAAF is planning to replace their aging H-6, a license-built version of the 1950’s Soviet Tu-16, emerged in 2015. In the following year, PLAAF General Ma Xiaotian <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160910011120/http:/www.janes.com/article/63448/china-developing-new-strategic-bomber">told </a>Chinese news outlet <i>China Daily </i>that a new bomber is in development and will enter service “sometime in the future.” It was revealed in 2018 that the PLAAF is working not an advanced variant of the Tu-16, but on a new subsonic strategic stealth bomber: the H-20.</p>
      <p>Chinese military doctrine sees the waters off China’s Eastern coast through three interconnected chains, a <a href="https://amti.csis.org/chinas-reach-grown-island-chains/">concept </a>adapted from Korean War-Era U.S. strategic thinking. The first chain encompasses the East and South China Seas, notably including the state of Taiwan. The second chain extends from Japan to Micronesia, while the third stretches from the Aleutian Islands to Hawaii. China’s long-term Pacific strategy is to dominate the first chain, contest the second, and threaten the third. But to accomplish this ambitious goal, the Chinese military must develop an effective deterrent against the principal source of U.S. power projection in the Pacific: Carrier Strike Groups.</p>
