      <p>Wiwynn, a cloud computing server affiliate of Wistron, is optimistic about its business outlook for 2020 with plans to build more production lines at is plant in southern Taiwan, according to company CTO Sunlai Chang.</p>
      <p>So far the company has a total of three production lines at the southern Taiwan factory and is looking to have the plant handle production of high-end AI servers, Chang said, adding it will gradually implement AI solutions at the production lines there to conduct smart manufacturing.</p>
      <p>Wiwynn has also been establishing new facilities including smart R&amp;D labs, trial production lines for new products, global product failure analysis lab and after-sales services and maintenance centers for the Asia Pacific market, Chang stated.</p>
      <p>Wiwynn is also cooperating with Taiwan's National Chiao Tung University (NCTU) for integrating AI functionalities such as self-analysis and self-repair into its server products, Chang noted.</p>
      <p>Commenting on market watchers' concerns over Wiwynn's 2020 outlook, Chang pointed out that the company's 2020 operation will be stronger than in 2019 due to strong order momentum from existing and new clients.</p>
      <p>Wiwynn had a gross margin of 7.5% in the third quarter of 2019, higher than market watchers' estimate of 6.6% and was better than second-quarter 2019's 6.8% and third-quarter 2018's 5.8%.</p>
