      <p>The Prime Minister has fired an early opening shot at Jeremy Corbyn as they prepare for the first head-to-head TV debate of the election campaign.</p>
      <p>The two leaders will face off in an hour-long encounter screened live on ITV this evening.</p>
      <p>Ahead of their encounter, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/boris-johnson/">Boris Johnson</a> set the tone by accusing Mr Corbyn of ‘ducking’ questions on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/brexit/">Brexit</a>.</p>
      <p>He published an open letter calling on the Labour leader to say which way he would recommend people vote in the party’s proposed second EU referendum.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn has come under fire over his refusal to say which way he would vote, even though other senior figures including shadow chancellor John McDonnell and shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry have made clear they would back Remain.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson said the upcoming general election is about ‘breaking the deadlock’ in Parliament that has prevented the country from leaving the EU.</p>

      <p>In his letter he told Mr Corbyn: ‘The public have a right to know where the two candidates for prime minister stand on the big questions facing the country at this election.</p>
      <p>‘So far in this campaign, you have ducked those questions.’</p>

      <p>The Lib Dems and the SNP remain angry at the exclusion of Jo Swinson and Nicola Sturgeon from Tuesday’s televised showdown.</p>
      <p>Both parties contested ITV’s decision to only include the Labour and Conservative leaders at a hearing in London on Monday, arguing it was unlawful because it breached impartiality rules.</p>
      <p>They argued their exclusion from the debate was depriving voters of a fair chance to decide who to vote for.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>But two leading judges ruled the decision was not open to challenge in the courts and that the parties’ only recourse was to complain to the regulator, Ofcom.</p>
      <p>Following the ruling, Lib Dem president Baroness Brinton called for televised debates between party leaders to be framed in stronger legislation.</p>

      <p>She said: ‘Our democracy should not be in the hands of invisible corporate structures and arrangements for such debates should always be accessible and transparent.</p>
      <p>‘We will not set our principles aside, we will continue this fight. Not just for this General Election, but for our future democracy too.’</p>
      <p>The SNP’s leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford, said: ‘The result of the decision to exclude the SNP is to discriminate against Scottish voters and to effectively treat them as second-class citizens.</p>
      <p>‘That is, quite simply, a democratic disgrace and the fact that election law and broadcasting codes allow such gross unfairness is unacceptable.’</p>
      <p>ITV said in a statement: ‘We welcome the court’s decision and will continue with our comprehensive election coverage as planned.’</p>
      <p>Ms Swinson is due to take part in a three-way debate with Mr Johnson and Mr Corbyn hosted by Sky on 28 November.</p>
      <p>The following day, the BBC will host a seven-way debate in Cardiff on 29 November, between leaders or senior figures from the seven major GB political parties.</p>

      <p>The BBC will then host a ‘prime ministerial debate’ on 6 December from Southampton between Mr Corbyn and Mr Johnson.</p>
      <p>Labour is trailing the Conservatives in the latest election polls, with Mr Corbyn heading into the debate at studios in MediaCityUK, Salford, hoping for an opportunity to make up ground.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson, who was criticised for his reluctance to debate directly with his rivals in the Tory leadership election, will be hoping to avoid making any blunders which could fuel his opponents.</p>
