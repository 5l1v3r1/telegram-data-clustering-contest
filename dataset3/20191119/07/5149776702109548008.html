      <p>A close look at what is happening with <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a> and the rest of the Championship ahead of the January transfer window.</p>
      <h4>Everton looking to splash the cash</h4>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a>'s Matty Cash is a £12m target for Everton, according to The Sun.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old has <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-player-ratings-season-3532587">been in good form</a> for the Reds so far this season, helping them challenge towards the top of the Championship under new head coach Sabri Lamouchi.</p>

        <figcaption>Forest star Matty Cash<cite>(Image: James Williamson - AMA/Getty Images)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>And his performances at the City Ground are said to have attracted the attention of Everton, with the Toffees claimed to be "lining up" a £12m move for Cash in January, when the transfer window opens for business.</p>
      <p>The Sun say scouts for the Goodison Park club have watched Cash in action for Lamouchi's Reds this season and <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/always-seen-nottingham-forest-ace-3533123">"like his versatility as a midfielder and full-back".</a></p>
      <h4>Ameobi latest</h4>
      <p>Sammy Ameobi has set his sights on a new contract at <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a>, having impressed since arriving in the summer.</p>
      <p>The winger has proved a popular figure this season under Sabri Lamouchi, clocking up 17 appearances and popping up with a couple of vital goals.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/transfer-news/reason-sammy-ameobi-joined-nottingham-3013738">After leaving Bolton Wanderers</a> in June, Ameobi penned a one-year deal at the City Ground, though he hopes his performances thus far are doing him no harm and hopes to secure a longer-term deal on Trentside.</p>

      <p>“Yes, absolutely,” said <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/tactical-look-new-nottingham-forest-3019207">the 27-year-old</a> when asked if he’d like to stay at the club.</p>
      <h4>McGinn mistake</h4>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a> were offering John McGinn "four or five times his money" when they tried to sign him from Hibs, according to the Scottish Premiership club.</p>
      <p>The Scotland international is now playing in the Premier League for Aston Villa, following a move to Villa Park in August 2018.</p>

      <p>And his impressive performances in the top flight has led to him being linked with Manchester United.</p>
      <p>It is two years since the Reds attempted to bring him to the City Ground from Hibs, but they ultimately failed to agree a fee for the attacking midfielder.</p>
