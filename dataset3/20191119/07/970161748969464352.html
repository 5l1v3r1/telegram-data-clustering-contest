      <p>When you get into debt, it can feel very overwhelming.</p>
      <p>You might have a credit card to pay, a buy now, pay later deal on a sofa and a loan that is tied to your house. So which one should you tackle first?</p>
      <p>There are two types – priority and non-priority debt. Everything might feel like a priority when you are missing payments but the distinction is that priority debts carry serious consequences for your basic standard of living.</p>
      <p>Consequences of not paying a priority debt include being made homeless or things like your gas or electricity being cut off.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, not paying a non-priority debts means something like a fine. This can seem hard but it does not affect your basic standard of life in the same way. Things like credit cards are non-priority debts.</p>
      <p>Priority debts are always the ones you should pay first.</p>
      <h3>Types of priority debt</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Priority debts include:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>court fines</li>
        <li>Council Tax</li>
        <li>TV Licence</li>
        <li>Child maintenance</li>
        <li>gas and electricity bills</li>
        <li>Income Tax, National Insurance and VAT</li>
        <li>mortgage, rent and any loans secured against your home</li>
        <li>hire purchase agreements, if what you’re buying with them is essential.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Andy Shaw, Debt Advice Coordinator at <a href="https://www.stepchange.org/">StepChange Debt Charity</a>, said: ‘When you’re looking at paying back debts, it’s important you prioritise the most important ones.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘However, this can be complicated if you don’t know how tell a priority bill from a non-priority debt.</p>
      <p>‘It’s therefore key that you evaluate each of your debts and consider what the consequences could be.</p>
      <p>‘StepChange’s website provides <a href="https://www.stepchange.org/debt-info/dealing-with-debt-problems/what-debts-to-pay-first.aspx">a handy list of priority debts</a> and consequences that can act as a good starting point for this.</p>
      <h3>Types of non-priority debts</h3>
      <p>Non-priority debts include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>credit card debts</li>
        <li>hire purchase agreements</li>
        <li>unsecured bank and payday loans (loans that are not secured against your property)</li>
        <li>water bills</li>
        <li>loans from friends and family</li>
      </ul>
      <p>‘Of everything you pay out, it’s important that you pay your priority debts or bills in full each month.</p>
      <p>‘If you find it difficult to keep up in any given month, it’s likely you would benefit from a free and comprehensive debt advice session.’</p>
      <p>Once you have handled these priority debts (or if you only have non-priority debts), you can think about the best order to tackle the rest.</p>
      <p>Paying off your highest interest debts first makes sense because they cost you the most money. If you can pay these, you have more money for your other debts.</p>
      <p>Some debts charge you a penalty for overpaying so check if this if the case. If not, pay as much as you can without missing the minimum payments for other things.</p>
      <p>Once you have managed this one, look at the next most expensive one and so on.</p>
