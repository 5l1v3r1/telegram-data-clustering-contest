      <h1>Sunderland trio George Dobson, Joel Lynch and Jordan Willis ruled out of Gillingham match</h1>
      <h2>Sunderland also have four players on international duty.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T07:45:59+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 07:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/jay-williams/" target="_blank">Jay Williams</a></address>
      <p>Three more players have joined Sunderland’s absentee list ahead of tonight’s FA Cup clash.</p>
      <p>Gillingham host Sunderland in the FA Cup replay after the reverse fixture ended 1-1 at The Stadium of Light. But Sunderland will be without George Dobson, Joel Lynch and Jordan Willis, <a href="https://www.safc.com/news/team-news/2019/november/team-news-v-gillingham-cup-replay">the club’s official website has confirmed</a>.</p>
      <p>Dobson will be rested as a precaution because of “ongoing problems”. Meanwhile, Lynch and Willis are ruled out with back and knee problems respectively.</p>
      <p>These three join Elliot Embleton, Lynden Gooch and Charlie Wyke on the injury list. Sunderland also have four players unavailable due to international duty.</p>

      <p>Parkinson confirmed this triple injury blow at a press conference. He said (<a href="https://www.safc.com/news/team-news/2019/november/team-news-v-gillingham-cup-replay">via safc.com</a>): “Lynch has had an injection in his back and Willis had an injection in his knee so neither will make it.</p>
      <p>“We’re going to rest George because he has an ongoing problem as well but should be ok for the weekend.”</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view</h3>
      <p>It seems like Lynch and Willis have been playing through injuries in recent weeks. In the long run, it is much wiser to rest them against Gillingham so they are fully fit for the promotion campaign.</p>
      <p>Dobson’s absence will be felt in midfield but there are plenty of other options to fill that gap. Sunderland have to try to negotiate this extra fixture without losing any more players – ahead of a tough clash with high-flying Coventry City at the weekend.</p>
