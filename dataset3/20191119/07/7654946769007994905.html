      <h1>White House releases statement on Trump’s surprise visit to Walter Reed</h1>

      <p>The White House released a statement from Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington, DC, on Monday that said President Trump’s visit there over the weekend was a “routine” checkup.</p>
      <p>The statement, written by Navy Commander Sean Conley, was released by White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham amid rumors about Trump’s medical condition.</p>
      <p>“Despite some of the speculation, the President has not had any chest pain, nor was he evaluated or treated for any urgent or acute issues,” Conley wrote in the letter.</p>
      <p>“Specifically, he did not undergo any specialized cardiac or neurological evaluations.”</p>
      <p>The letter added that the visit was kept “off the record” due to uncertainties about the president’s schedule.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, Grisham said the visit was part of his annual checkup, which he was getting out of the way early, but then revealed that he didn’t stay at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for very long.</p>
      <p>“Anticipating a very busy 2020, the President is taking advantage of a free weekend here in Washington, D.C., to begin portions of his routine annual physical exam at Walter Reed,” Grisham said in a statement Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Trump in February <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/02/08/doctor-says-trump-in-excellent-health-could-use-some-exercise-after-physical/">spent more than four hours</a> at Walter Reed for a checkup supervised by his physician and involving a panel of 11 specialists.</p>
