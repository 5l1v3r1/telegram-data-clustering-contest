      <p><b>Washington</b>: Three people were killed in a shooting early Monday outside a Walmart store in Oklahoma, including the assailant, police said -- the latest in a string of deadly gun attacks at the popular supermarket chain.</p>
      <p>Danny Ford, the police chief in the town of Duncan, said the shooting -- an apparent domestic dispute -- took place shortly before 10:00 am (1600 GMT) in a parking lot in front of the store.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"We have three individuals that are deceased. We have two white males and a white female. Two of the victims are inside the vehicle, one is outside the vehicle," said Ford.</p>
      <p>A handgun was also found at the scene, police said.</p>
      <p>Witnesses told local news channels that the shooter approached his victims while they were inside the vehicle, opening fire on them.</p>
      <p>He then turned his weapon on himself when a fourth man reportedly pulled out a firearm and challenged the shooter, they said.</p>
      <p>Family members at the scene said the shooting was a domestic dispute between a husband and his wife, a local Fox news affiliate reported.</p>
      <p>A Walmart spokeswoman told Fox that no staff members were involved in the incident in Duncan, a town of 22,000 inhabitants some 75 miles (120 kilometers) south of Oklahoma City, the state capital.</p>
      <p>Schools in the area had been placed on lockdown temporarily before being given an "all clear" by local police, the local school district said in a statement.</p>
      <p>At the start of this month, a new permitless carry law came into effect in the central US state, allowing anyone over 21 and without a felony conviction to carry a gun without a permit or a license.</p>
      <p>A gunman killed 22 people in a Walmart store in August in El Paso, Texas, while another Walmart store in Mississippi was the scene of a shooting in late July, when a disgruntled employee killed two co-workers and wounded a police officer.</p>
      <p>In the El Paso shooting, the 21-year-old gunman said he had launched the deadly attack in response to what he called a "Hispanic invasion" of Texas.</p>
      <p>Walmart said in the wake of the two shootings inside its stores within a week of each other that it would limit sales of guns and ammunition.</p>
