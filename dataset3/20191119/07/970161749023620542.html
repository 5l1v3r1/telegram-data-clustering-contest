        <b>Mitchell Deveraux (Imran Adams) has been through an incredibly tough time in Hollyoaks over the past couple of months, what with him conflicted over his feelings for Scott Drinkwell (Ross Adams). However, Cleo McQueen (Nadine Mulkerrin) discovered the truth about his dalliance with the young man several weeks back, so — in the coming episodes — the pair attempt to come to terms with their brave new world.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In the coming episodes, Mitchell and Scott are awkward with each other when in other people’s company — something which leads to Scott coming up with a suggestion: that they should move in together. Mitchell’s expression is one of shock, that’s for sure.</p>
      <p>However, later in the week, Scott manages to convince Mitchell into allowing him to move in, but Martine (Kelle Bryan) later shows up, and thus Scott is forced to hide in the bedroom.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Scott later tells Damon (Jacob Roberts) that he’s moved in with his new boyfriend, while Mitchell informs Martine he’s not ready to introduce her to his new ‘girlfriend’.</p>

      <p>As a result of everything that’s happened, Martine suggests that Mitchell should move back in with her. However, little does he know that Scott has already starting putting his mark on the flat!</p>
      <p>Later in the week, Scott is left horrified when a couple arrive to check out the flat.</p>
      <p>Has Mitchell gone behind Scott’s back? If so, how will Scott react?</p>
      <p>Can they make a proper go of it?</p>
