      <h1>Half Life: Alyx announced by Valve as flagship VR title</h1>

      <p>It was earlier this year when Valve properly entered the VR market itself through its own headset <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/04/30/valve-index-preorder-may-1st/">Valve Index</a>, and it marked a sign of things to come. Valve confirmed it would be working on its own VR titles, and the company has made its first announcement regarding those games. This is a big one as for the first time in years a new Half Life game is coming.</p>
      <p>Half Life: Alyx has been confirmed as one of Valve’s VR flagship titles.</p>

      <p>What do we know about the game’s story? Not much though going by the name it’s likely players will be taking on the role of Alyx Vance, an ally of Gordon Freeman and member of the resistance against the Combine.  Apparently, Half-Life: Alyx will be a prequel of sorts instead of a continuation of the story, so this isn’t Half-Life 3. However, that doesn’t mean Valve isn’t working on Half-Life 3. Valve has stated there will be a full reveal of Half-Life: Alyx on Thursday at 10am PT which will be 6pm GMT.</p>
