      <h1>Samsung shares tidbits on how it went about designing the Galaxy Fold</h1>

      <p>Samsung’s first foldable device may only have arrived in retail shelves this year, but it has been cooking in the oven for quite a few years. The Galaxy Fold is one complex and beautiful piece of machinery that makes foldable displays a reality, and Samsung has now <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/from-concept-to-creation-designing-the-galaxy-fold">published a post</a> titled ‘From Concept to Creation: Designing the Galaxy Fold’ that takes us through some of the design choices and the thought process behind the Fold.</p>
      <h3>Nearly 1000 prototypes were tested before Galaxy Fold design was finalized</h3>
      <p>Samsung says that it studied how people fold and unfold various things, such as books and wallets, in their day-to-day life to finalize the form factor of the Galaxy Fold. Its design team also “constructed over 1,000 prototypes using a wide array of materials, including foam board and various fabrics” before settling for the in-folding design, which is, in our opinion, a <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/2019/02/25/huawei-foldable-phone-vs-samsung-galaxy-fold-hype-real">lot more sensible than a foldable display</a> that folds outwards. The main display was chosen to be 7.3 inches in size so it could offer sufficiently large screen real estate and still be easy to carry around.</p>
      <p>Samsung also made sure the two halves of the device are equally heavy for a balanced feel, while the fingerprint sensor is located where a user’s thumb naturally falls. Of course, an in-display fingerprint reader would be comfortable for both right and left-handed users, but that was clearly not an option considering the foldable display is made of plastic and wouldn’t handle the pressure needed to operate in-display fingerprint readers. And physical fingerprint readers <i>are</i> superior when it comes to speed and accuracy, so we’re not exactly complaining that the $2000 Fold doesn’t have the newer fingerprint tech from the Galaxy S10 and Galaxy Note 10.</p>
