      <p>I’m A Celebrity’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ian-wright/">Ian Wright</a> has opened up about his estranged sister <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dating/">dating</a> his best friend, and former teammate, Mark Bright.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/arsenal-fc/">Arsenal</a> footballer revealed that he hasn’t spoken to sibling Dionne in 15-years – despite the fact she is seeing one of his closest pals.</p>
      <p>During an appearance on <a href="https://player.fm/series/the-true-geordie-podcast-1347711/ep-108-108-ian-wright-true-geordie-podcast">the True Geordie podcast</a>, the 56-year-old claimed they fell out after she was ‘disrespectful’ to his wife, Nancy, soon after they started dating, something he has never forgiven her for.</p>
      <p>Discussing how it affects his friendship with the ex-Leicester City star, whom he is still close to, he said: ‘Mark Bright is somebody like a big brother and someone I respect who has guided me.</p>
      <p>‘What will happen if they get married? Is she going to apologise before she walks up the aisle?</p>

      <p>‘I want something to happen because my wife does not deserve to be treated like this. My sister has not found the decency to realise she have apologised by now.</p>
      <p>‘I haven’t spoken to my sister for 15 years. She was very disrespectful to my wife when we had just got together. She obviously knew my ex-wife and my kids so she felt like she had to take a side which I couldn’t understand because I am her brother.’</p>

      <p>Lifting the lid on what soured their relationship, Ian claimed Dionne publicly ‘blanked’ Nancy during filming for a Channel 4 series, to ‘be true’ to her niece and nephew.</p>
      <p>The dad-of-eight said she refused to apologise for her actions, so he vowed never to see her again.</p>
      <p>‘Nancy went to introduce herself and she totally blanked her in front of people, saying something about, “I have to be true to my niece and nephew”,’ he continued.</p>
      <p>‘When I went over to her I could feel the anger from my toes. I said: “As long as we live I don’t want to ever see you again. The only time I will speak to you is when you apologise to her”.</p>
      <p>‘And she said, “I am not apologising to anyone.” So I said, “That is good because I will never have to see you again”.’</p>

      <p>He also has Shaun and Bradley Wright-Phillips with ex Sharon, as well as daughter Coco and son Brett from previous relationships.</p>
      <p>Ian married current wife Nancy back in 2011, with the pair sharing daughters Lola and Roxanne.</p>
      <p>While it is not clear how long Mark and Dionne have been dating for, the pair seem to be seriously loved up, with the footballer reportedly paying tribute to her in his book.</p>
      <p>According to the Mirror, in the acknowledgment section, he simply wrote: ‘Dee, best of the best. X.’</p>
