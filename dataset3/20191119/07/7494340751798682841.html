      <h1>Senator Introduces Bill That Would Block US Companies From Storing Data In China</h1>

      <p>An anonymous reader quotes a report from The Hill: <i>Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) on Monday <a href="https://www.axios.com/hawley-bill-targets-apple-and-tiktok-ties-to-china-85fca598-c6cf-49aa-93b7-bb69bcb44f4f.html">introduced</a> a bill that <a href="https://thehill.com/policy/technology/470860-gop-senator-introduces-bill-to-limit-flow-of-us-data-to-china">would curtail the flow of sensitive information about people in the U.S. to China</a> through large tech companies like Apple and TikTok. Hawley's legislation would place new and wide-reaching limitations on companies with ties to China such as TikTok, the mega-popular social media platform owned by a Chinese firm, and Apple, an American company that builds many of its components in mainland China. <br/><br/>The bill, called the <a href="https://www.hawley.senate.gov/sites/default/files/2019-11/National-Security-Personal-Data-Protection-Act-One-Pager.pdf">National Security and Personal Data Protection Act</a>, would subject a litany of companies with ties to countries of "national security concern," including Russia and China, to a new privacy regime. Sens. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) also signed onto the bill on Monday. Hawley's bill would apply to tech companies that are subject to Chinese or Russian law, or are under the jurisdiction of those countries in a way that would allow those governments to access user data without "respect for civil liberties and privacy," according to the bill. Those companies would not be allowed to collect private data beyond what is required to run their services or transfer data on U.S. users to countries of concern. They would also be required to store information on U.S. users in the United States itself, and would have to submit a yearly report proving their compliance with the law once a year to the Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. attorney general, and all state attorneys general.</i></p>
