      <p>Pink ball cricket is new to the Indian cricket team as they are all set to play a Day/Night Test for the first time. Kolkata’s Eden Gardens is hosting India and Bangladesh’s first Pink ball match starting from November 22 and team India’s vice-captain <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/ajinkya-rahane/">Ajinkya Rahane</a> has started dreaming about the pink ball challenge three days before the match begins.</p>
      <p>Rahane is getting trolled on social media by his skipper <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/virat-kohli/">Virat Kohli</a> and teammate <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/shikhar-dhawan/">Shikhar Dhawan</a> after he shared a picture about him dreaming about the upcoming day-night Test in Kolkata.”Already dreaming about the historic pink ball test,” wrote Rahane in a post on Instagram along with a picture of him sleeping and a pink ball lying next to him.</p>

      <p>Kohli and Dhawan wasted no time in trolling Rahane. “Nice pose jinksy,” Kohli replied on the post while Dhawan wrote, “Sapney mein pic khich gayi.”</p>
      <p>Gearing up for their maiden Pink ball Test, both the Bangladesh and Indian team have been practising in the twilight zone and under lights at the Holkar Stadium, trying to simulate conditions that they are likely to encounter at the Eden Gardens. The entire Bangladesh team spent approximately three hours at the center wickets on Monday with head coach Russell Domingo giving catching drills to the players in the slip cordon and wicketkeeper Liton Das.</p>
      <p>Skipper Virat Kohli and vice-captain Ajinkya Rahane will be the first to arrive here on Tuesday morning ahead of India’s first ever Day/Night Test beginning on November 22.</p>
