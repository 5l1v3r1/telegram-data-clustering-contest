        <i>British colonial anthropologist Northcote Thomas took thousands of photographs and sound recordings of men, women and children in west Africa between 1909 and 1915. Some of these works, which reflect the reprehensible colonial mindset, feature in short Faces|Voices – winner of this year’s Arts and Humanities Research Council <a href="https://ahrc.ukri.org/innovation/research-in-film-awards/the-awards/#researchfilm">(AHRC) Best Research Film of the Year Award </a>– in which Londoners respond to the faces of these people. Here’s a selection of the original images</i>

      <p>As part of the wider <a href="https://re-entanglements.net/">[Re:]Entanglements </a>project, based at SOAS University of London, researchers have been retracing NW Thomas’s itineraries in Nigeria and Sierra Leone and passing on copies of the archival photographs to their descendants</p>

      <h3>A man in Iyede, Delta State, Nigeria, 1909</h3>
      <p>NW Thomas was the first government anthropologist appointed by the British Colonial Office. He conducted surveys in what were then the British protectorates of Southern Nigeria and Sierra Leone 1909-15. This was the height of colonialism and its outdated attitudes and notions of superiority are reflected in Thomas’s project. A number board was often held above the subject’s heads to identify the photographic plate and individual; its effect is to further dehumanise its subjects. <i>All photographs: NW Thomas/courtesy of the Royal Anthropological Institute</i></p>

      <h3>Chukuma, a young man with tribal marks, Awka, Anambra State, Nigeria, 1910</h3>
      <p>Around half of the approximately 7,500 photographs taken during the surveys are meant to be so-called “physical type” portraits, an abhorrent approach that is addressed in the Faces/Voices film.</p>

      <p>Subjects were photographed full face and in profile.</p>

      <h3>A priest in Aniedu, Sabon Gida, Edo State, Nigeria, 1909</h3>
      <p>Anthropologists were interested in documenting hair styles and scarification marks, as well as facial characteristics</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>A young man in Agukwu Nri, Anambra State, Nigeria, 1911</h3>
      <p>While Thomas often recorded the names of those he photographed, others were described merely as “man”, “woman” or “child”, another dehumanising aspect of his project</p>

      <h3>Obuweluzo, Agukwu Nri, Anambra State, Nigeria, 1911</h3>
      <p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3UBv8pmLxE&amp;feature=youtu.be">Faces|Voices</a>, a number of British women and men of African heritage – some from the regions in which Thomas worked a century ago, others who are engaged in activism and community education – were invited to respond to the photographs. The short film has won this year’s <a href="https://ahrc.ukri.org/innovation/research-in-film-awards/the-awards/">Research in Film award</a></p>

      <p>Seen through different eyes in Faces/Voices, the meaning of the photographs shifts.</p>

      <h3>A chief, Kokori, Delta State, Nigeria, 1910</h3>
      <p>One woman in the film says: ‘Any recording of our people – African people – from my perspective as an African woman is important because much of our history has been subjugated, maligned, buried, distorted. So even though one could say that the general context within which these pictures were taken was one of violence, I still think the fact that we have these images is important. We know these people existed. They leave traces, memories, contributions to knowledge that we can learn from. <i>’ (Quotes above and below from the responses in<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3UBv8pmLxE&amp;feature=youtu.be"> Faces|Voices)</a></i></p>

      <h3>Yainkain, Head wife of Chief Sehi Bureh of Tormah, Tormabum, Southern Province, Sierra Leone, 1915</h3>
      <p>Some of the responses included: ‘She looks very motherly.’ ‘She looks like she’s got a lot of responsibilities.’ ‘Her face in and of itself doesn’t look sad, but her eyes look very sad. Not because of what she’s doing or where she is, but something ages ago, like there is a long, long deep sadness’</p>

      <h3>Elexnaii of Otua, Otuo, Edo State, Nigeria, 1909</h3>
      <p>‘I am wondering how she feels about being photographed – bare-breasted. I’m not sure. I can’t tell from her expression whether she is happy or unhappy, but certainly she knows that she’s being gazed at’</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>‘Emukoko’, Ovu, Delta State, Nigeria, 1910</h3>
      <p>‘Young, from a rich background – because of the teeth. Teeth sharpening cost a lot in those days, and for someone so young to have it, [he was] probably from a rich family.’ ‘Just stunning. I am just blown away really. It makes me smile. It makes me want to meet this person’</p>

      </figure>
      <h3>Igiokiero, Otuo, Edo State, Nigeria, 1909</h3>
      <p>‘Maybe someone who has some authority or has some influence.’ ‘She looks as though she’s somebody important.’</p>
      <figure>

      <h3>Mother of Obaraiagbon, Benin City, Edo State, Nigeria, 1909</h3>
      <p>‘The image is striking because of her hairstyle. It’s very well done.’ ‘I could do that hairstyle today!’ ‘The aesthetics of the fashion of those times … the hairstyle is amazing. A lot of this has been lost now’</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e6d79986c48d475db7a5b896cfb4a6e70d054f40/0_0_2835_1890/master/2835.jpg?width=1010&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=008e3be8c08d57982cb6bb904d8b0fe1"/>
