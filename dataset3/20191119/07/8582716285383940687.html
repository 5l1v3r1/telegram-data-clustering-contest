      <p><b>TOKYO — </b>Prime Minister Shinzo Abe tied Japan's record for longest-serving premier on Tuesday - a remarkable feat for a leader who once quit in humiliation - amid economic worries and allegations that he violated election laws.</p>
      <p>Abe, 65, has won relatively high marks for his diplomacy. His warm ties with U.S. President Donald Trump may have averted worst-case scenarios in trade feuds, although little progress has been made on a territorial row with Russia and relations with South Korea are frigid.</p>
      <p>"There is no other world leader getting along so well with Trump," said Akihisa Nagashima, a one-time opposition lawmaker who now in Abe's Liberal Democratic Party.</p>
      <p>Abe, who served a troubled one-year term before quitting in 2007, made a comeback in December 2012, promising a stronger military and a revamped economy while aiming to revise Japan's post-war, pacifist constitution.</p>
      <p>Abe has now served a total 2,886 days in office, tying the record set by Taro Katsura more than a century ago.</p>
      <p>He has led his ruling coalition to six national election victories since returning, surviving allegations of cronyism and scandals over falsified data by bureaucrats.</p>
      <p>Those victories were aided by a fragmented opposition and memories of the rocky 2009-2012 rule by the novice Democratic Party of Japan, which left many voters longing for stability.</p>
      <p>"The biggest reason (for his longevity) is that he's better than the DPJ government," Seiko Noda, an LDP lawmaker and potential Abe rival, told Reuters.</p>
      <p>But since a cabinet reshuffle in September, two ministers - both close allies of Abe - have had to resign over allegations of election campaign law violations.</p>
      <p>Now Abe is under fire over accusations he not only favored supporters with invites to a state-funded cherry blossom viewing party but may have broken campaign laws by subsidising backers' attendance at a reception the night before.</p>
      <p>Abe has denied wrongdoing. A Nov 16-17 Asahi newspaper poll showed 68% were not convinced by his explanations, though his support rating was steady at 44%.</p>
      <p>Concerns that the economy is headed for recession amid the fading impacts of his "Abenomics" policies also cloud Abe's future. Critics say his third "arrow" of structural reform never flew.</p>
