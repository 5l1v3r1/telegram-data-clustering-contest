        <b>Jennifer Lopez chose passion over a pay cheque when it came to Hustlers as the actress has revealed she didn’t get paid to star in or produce the movie.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hustlers sees the Love Don’t Cost A Thing singer <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/10/inside-hustlers-costume-secrets-jennifer-lopezs-awkward-wardrobe-mishap-bonding-strip-club-10896621/">play Ramona, a stripper who starts a side scam to swindle money</a> out of unwitting Wall Street bankers by drugging them.</p>
      <p>The movie was well-received by fans and critics who are predicting Jennifer, 50, to earn an Oscar nomination for her performance.</p>
      <p>It was also a box office success after grossing an estimated $148.5 million (£113.8 million) worldwide.</p>
      <p>So with all that success, it’s given us whiplash to find out that Jennifer apparently didn’t get paid a dime for the movie.</p>
      <p>Speaking in <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/jennifer-lopez-icon-of-the-year-2019">GQ’s Men of the Year issue</a> – in which she’s named one of them – Jennifer said: ‘I didn’t get paid a whole bunch of money for Hustlers.’</p>

      <p>Say what?</p>
      <p>She added: ‘I did it for free and produced it. Like Jenny from the Block — I do what I love.’</p>

      <p>We get the whole passion thing but, honestly, we’d take the dollars.</p>
      <p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, Jennifer is worth an estimated $400 million (£306 million) so she probably can afford to miss out on a few other millions.</p>
      <p>Later in the interview, Jennifer went on to explain how her fiance Alex Rodriguez has made her better at managing money when it comes to her business ventures.</p>
      <p>The Jenny From The Block singer explained: ‘When I first met him, I was telling him about my perfume business. He loves business…</p>

      <p>‘And he knew that I was a creative person who had clothing lines, perfume lines, and had some success in consumer sales.</p>
      <p>‘So I was telling him a story. And he was like, “Wait, what did you say? How much did you make? I think there’s a better way to do it”.’</p>

      <p>The Selena actress revealed how she’s now investing in her own businesses as opposed to licensing.</p>
      <p>She states honestly: ‘You wind up making billions of dollars for people, but you’re still having to hustle.’</p>
      <p>Oh and FYI, Jennifer insists that money doesn’t make her horny. Just for the record, of course.</p>
      <p>While J.Lo claims to have worked for free on Hustlers, her co-star Cardi B recently boasted about her salary from starring in the film.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Ellen DeGeneres, Cardi said last month: ‘I enjoyed it. I couldn’t believe that I was on set for, like, 16 hours. Like, goddamn, is this what actors and actresses got to go through?</p>
      <p>‘I’m going to shoot for a film this month. I enjoy the checks.’</p>
