      <p>A history-sheeter was murdered by an eight-member gang in Karunguli near Vadalur on Monday night. The victim was identified as P. Amaran alias Amarnath, 23, of Thanjavur district. Police said Amaran was accused in the murder of a history-sheeter ‘Maduvapet’ Murali in Puducherry in 2017.</p>
      <p>On Monday, a local court in Puducherry acquitted all the 11 accused including Amaran in the murder case. Amaran, along with his father Pandian and relatives Udayakumar and Bala, were returning to Thanjavur in an SUV when they stopped in front of a Tasmac outlet in Karunkuli to buy liquor.</p>
      <p>Police said Amaran was waiting in the car when an eight-member gang dragged him out of the vehicle and hacked him to death. Pandian, who was in front of the Tasmac shop, tried to save his son. The gang attacked him too and he sustained injuries and was admitted to the Cuddalore Government General Hospital.</p>
      <p>Police suspect previous enmity to be the reason behind the murder. A case has been registered.</p>
