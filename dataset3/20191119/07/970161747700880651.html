      </figure>
      <p>This international bestseller and award-winning study presents a sweeping history of debt, even showing that debt existed long before humanity even had money.</p>
      <p>David Graeber, an anthropologist at the London School of Economics, and one of the organisers of Occupy Wall Street, argues that our current ideas about money are limited, if not completely wrong.</p>
      <p>He says society has always been divided into debtors and creditors, and debt and forgiveness have been at the centre of political debate long before money existed. Graeber shows how we are still fighting these battles today.</p>
      <p>While this may not provide practical advice for your personal money woes, it could help to give you a wider understanding of the global picture of money, wealth and debt.</p>
