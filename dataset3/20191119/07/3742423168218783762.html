      <h1>Confirmed: The Simpsons Are On Disney+ Australia</h1>

      <p>Disney Plus is the latest Netflix competitor to land in Australia. For the past few weeks, we've been wondering if we'll be getting the full American lineup - particularly <i>The Simpsons</i>, which currently streams exclusively on Foxtel.</p>
      <p>We just got confirmation from Disney that <i>The Simpsons</i> will indeed be available on the Australian platform at launch with a few caveats. Here's what you need to know.</p>

      <p>It's official: The Australian version of Disney+ will provide on-demand access to series 1 to 29 of <i>The Simpsons</i>. That's over 630 episodes to binge on! Seasons 30 and 31 will presumably be added at a later date.</p>
      <p>This is a huge boon to Aussie Simpsons fans who have never had on-demand access to the series before. (Well, apart from DVDs that is.)</p>
      <p>Even better, the episodes <a href="https://www.lifehacker.com.au/2019/11/disney-plus-movies-and-tv-shows-last-forever/">won't be leaving the service</a> thanks to Disney's acquisition of Fox. In other words, Disney+ subscribers basically have the entire Simpsons catalogue in one place, forever.</p>
      <p>Admittedly, <i>The Simpsons</i>' heyday was a very long time ago - probably before some of you were even born. But it remains a landmark of television, comedy and western culture. Having it all in one place for $8.99 is a very tempting proposition.</p>
      <p>With that said, there are a couple of issues it pays to be aware of. Namely:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The memorable Michael Jackson episode <i>Stark Raving Dad</i> <a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/11/michael-jackson-simpsons-episode-disney-plus/">has been expunged from existence</a> for obvious reasons. It will not be appearing on Disney Plus.</li>
        <li>Earlier episodes have been cropped to match modern TVs' widescreen aspect ratio. While this looks better, it has resulted in several visual gags being ruined. (See below for an example.)</li>
      </ol>

      <p>On the plus side, <a href="https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/11/disney-plus-is-going-to-embiggen-the-simpsons-back-to-its-proper-aspect-ratio-next-year/">Disney has promised to release</a> the old episodes in their original aspect ratio early next year. As for <i>Stark Raving Dad</i>, it wasn't that great of an episode anyway.</p>
