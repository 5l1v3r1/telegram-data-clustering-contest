      <h2>The actress couldn't stop the tears from falling as she discussed her complex relationship with the late rapper on her Red Table Talk chat show</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T07:51:26+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 07:51</time> by <a rel="author">Lucy Needham, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>Jada Pinkett Smith broke down in tears as she opened up about her friendship with Tupac Shakur, saying "It's hard to love someone who has a legacy."</p>
      <p>The two stars both attended the same high school in Baltimore and went on to have a complex relationship and fell out just before the rapper was fatally shot in September 1996.</p>
      <p>Jada became very emotional as she recalled her 'complex' relationship with Tupac with Robyn Crawford on her chat show Red Table Talk.</p>
      <p>The pair spoke about the struggle of loving someone in the spotlight following the release of Robyn's book A Song For You which details her love affair with Whitney Houston.</p>

      <p>"When you said [the book is] a love letter to Whitney, that resonated as so powerful," Jada told her guest. "It was so healing for me in so many different ways. It's hard to live someone who has had a legacy at the level she has had and then to lose them under tragic circumstances. I have a very similar situation."</p>
      <p>Jada went on to say that she and Tupac acted as each other's 'anchors' when they found fame.</p>
      <p>"Him feeling like, ‘You’re the only stability I got, I can’t afford for you to put that attention elsewhere,’" Jada said of Tupac.</p>

      <p>"For him, it was, we were an anchor for each other. Anytime he felt like that anchor was threatened, oh my God,'" she added.</p>
      <p>The actress previously revealed that she had bickered with Tupac before his death over her fears he was heading down a destructive path.</p>
      <p>They were still not speaking when Tupac was killed in Las Vegas in 1996 meaning Jada never got to make ammends.</p>

      <p>For her latest episode of Red Table Talk, Jada sat down with Robyn Crawford who discussed her relationship with Whitney Houston.</p>
      <p>Robyn revealed that she had known Whitney for twenty years before she decided to walk away after becoming worried about her explosive marriage to Bobbi Brown.</p>
      <p>"The more I saw and heard and the messier it got, I thought she'd get tired of it," Robyn recalled. "Whitney had a lot of pride and a strong will. But every time I thought that would be it, it wasn't."</p>
      <p>Blinking back tears, Jada said: "I know the depth of that struggle, having to do it as well."</p>

      <p>Speaking to Howard Stern in 2015, Jada described how she and Tupac got into a "hardcore" fight before he died.</p>
      <p>"There’s not a day that goes by that I don’t think about Pac. I think about him every single day," she said of her high school friend.</p>
      <p>She said that she and Tupac lacked 'physical chemistry' and did kiss each other once but it never went anywhere.</p>
