      <h1>Halsey Has Some Hilarious Responses To New Pregnancy Rumors Sparked By BF Evan Peters Touching Her Belly In New Pics</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T07:58:31+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 07:58</time> by <a rel="author">Nick Markus</a></address>
      <p>Another day, another female celebrity rumored to be pregnant for absolutely no reason other than the fact that she has a uterus! Halsey sparked speculations that she and her new boyfriend, actor Evan Peters, are going to be parents by just simply rubbing her stomach in a couple of pics!</p>
      <p>Well, the snaps also showed Evan appearing to do the same to her midsection as well and when they surfaced online, people could not help but read too much into it!</p>
      <p>In response, Halsey took to her Twitter account to mock the rumors with some funny posts!</p>
      <p>‘Is it a boy? Is it a girl? It’s pancakes,’ she humorously announces in a first tweet.</p>
      <p>Soon after, she came back to the same platform to also write: ‘Still not pregnant. Still just allergic to gluten. Still love pancakes.’</p>
      <p>So there you have it, folks! Halsey is not expecting a bundle of joy but just enjoying some yummy food!</p>
      <p>Her followers were definitely entertained by her sassy tweets so they responded with equally clever and funny comments such as: ‘You are cute and love pancakes!’ / ‘Congrats on the pancakes.’ / ‘So you just have really good taste in food.’</p>
      <p>And that’s not even all as some fans took the time to photoshop a sonogram to show pancakes instead of a fetus!</p>
      <p>This puts the pictures of Halsey and Evan laughing while both were touching her belly more into context.</p>
      <p>The new couple was probably just having a laugh over how full she was!</p>
