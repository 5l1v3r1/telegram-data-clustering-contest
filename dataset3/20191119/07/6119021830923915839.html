      <p>In a bid to make the youth aware about the IAF and encourage them to join the forces, then Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa had launched the combat-based mobile game 'Indian Air Force: A Cut above' in New Delhi on July 31.</p>
      <p>On July 20, IAF had released the teaser of the game. The teaser gave insights on the single-player game and showed several fighter jets in aerial combat, targeting different on-land structures.</p>
      <p>The game features a character sporting a gunslinger moustache similar to that of Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, who was captured and later released by Pakistan after his vintage MiG-21 Bison aircraft was shot down in an aerial dogfight which broke out in the aftermath of Balakot airstrike in February this year.</p>
      <p>Varthaman, who was grounded due to the incident, joined back and flew a sortie in a MiG-21 fighter aircraft along with Dhanoa from the Pathankot airbase in September.</p>
