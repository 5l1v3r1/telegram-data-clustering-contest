      <h1>To Become More Lethal, The U.S. Army Is Cutting Old Programs</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T07:04:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 07:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://nationalinterest.org/" target="_blank">David Axe</a></address>
      <p><b>Key point: </b>The Army wants to prioritize six new kinds of hardware.</p>
      <p>The U.S. Army is slowing, cutting and canceling hundreds of weapons programs in order to free up cash for just six kinds of new hardware.</p>
      <p>The <u><a href="https://breakingdefense.com/2019/03/army-lumbers-into-future-33b-in-2020-budget-for-big-6-some-day/">"Big Six"</a></u> are key to winning high-tech wars against modern armies such as Russia's or China's, according to the ground-combat branch.</p>
      <p>The Army's $190-billion budget proposal, which represents an $8-billion boost compared to the branch's 2019 budget, channels $9 billion into <u><a href="https://www.defensenews.com/land/2019/03/09/at-advent-of-ambitious-mod-plan-army-seeks-190b-in-fy20/">six main efforts</a></u>.</p>
      <p>The highest-priority category is Long-Range Precision Fires or LRPF. In other words, artillery and ground-to-ground rockets. In 2020 the Army wants to spend $1.3 billion improving its howitzers and rocket launchers and developing new, longer-range munitions.</p>
      <p>Howitzers are getting longer barrels to boost their firing range plus new, father-flying shells. Rocket launchers are getting new, longer-range munitions, potentially including some with anti-ship capability.</p>
      <p>Next in line is Next-Generation Combat Vehicles or NGCV. Tanks and fighting vehicles. The Army in 2020 wants to spend $2 billion developing NGCV. The new vehicles eventually would replace the Cold War-vintage M-2 fighting vehicle and potentially the M-1 tank, as well.</p>
      <p>The Army has tried and failed at least twice to develop a replacement for the M-2. One attempt ended with the 2009 collapse of the overly-complex Future Combat Systems program. The other failed in 2014 on account of its ballooning weight.</p>
      <p>After NGCV there's Future Vertical Lift, an initiative to develop a new, high-speed aircraft to replace existing UH-60 and CH-47 helicopters plus a separate attack and reconnaissance aircraft to fill the gap left by the Armyâ€™s failure to develop a replacement for the now-retired OH-58D scout helicopter. The twin aviation efforts would get $800 million in 2020.</p>
      <p>The Army's fourth priority is its communications network, which would tie together all the other forces and would get $2.3 billion in 2020.</p>
      <p>Air &amp; Missile Defense -- surface-to-air missiles and their supporting launchers and radars -- is the fifth priority and would receive $1.4 billion in funding in 2020.</p>
