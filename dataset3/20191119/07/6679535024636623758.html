      <p>Only those government doctors who prevented others from working, were transferred. This transfer of very few doctors was not meant to be a punishment, State Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar said on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>It may be recalled that the State government had transferred about 70 doctors affiliated to the Federation of Government Doctors Association after they went on an indefinite strike for seven days to put forward their demands. Most of them were State-level and district-level organisers of the strike.</p>
      <p>At a function to distribute Chief Minister's Comprehensive Health Insurance Scheme (CMCHIS) cards to 600 beneficiaries, the Minister said transfer of doctors was a continuous administrative function, a press release said.</p>
      <p>He added that the State government has applied for the setting up of three more medical colleges in Krishnagiri, Nagapattinam and Tiruvallur.</p>
      <p>The CMCHIS provides an annual coverage of up to ₹5 lakh to 1.58 crore families. Tamil Nadu is the only State in the country to provide an insurance cover of ₹25 lakh to ₹35 lakh for advanced surgeries through CMCHIS. Beneficiaries are entitled to treatment in 255 government hospitals and 747 empanelled private hospitals, he said.</p>
      <p>Fisheries Minister D. Jayakumar was present at the event.</p>
