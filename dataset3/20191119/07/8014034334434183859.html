      <p>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Airbus says British budget carrier easyJet will buy 12 more A320neos it previously had options to purchase, pushing the airline’s total order for the single-aisle plane to 159.</p>
      <p>The airline operates mostly across Europe with a fleet of entirely Airbus aircraft, serving 155 European airports.</p>
      <p>The list price of the A320neo in 2018 was $110.6 million, making the order for 12 worth about $1.3 billion. Airlines, however, typically negotiate better prices.</p>
      <p>The announcement was made on Tuesday, the third day of the biennial Dubai Airshow.</p>
      <p>Airbus on Monday secured $30 billion in sales at the airshow while competitor Boeing got a boost for its troubled 737 Max jets grounded around the world when Turkey’s SunExpress announced it would purchase 10 more for its fleet.</p>
