      <h1>Time for government to recognise contribution of artistes: Rishi Kapoor</h1>
      <h2>Rishi Kapoor said it's about time a culture is set in where people from the field of arts, culture and even business are given their due recognition from the government.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T07:48:27+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 07:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/pti/" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>Actor <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/rishi-kapoor/">Rishi Kapoor</a> says it is important to recognise the role of artistes and cinema in the country as they have contributed immensely to its cultural, financial growth.</p>
      <p>The 67-year-old actor completes 50 years in the industry next year.</p>
      <p>Asked whether he looked at his career with fulfilment, Rishi told PTI, “That is something the people have to say. I don’t. But I have to wait for you people to say that this man has been working for 50 years, but no one does that (talk about contribution).</p>
      <p>“The government doesn’t. That’s the tragedy. The government changes but this sadness remains.”</p>
      <p>The actor said it’s about time a culture is set in where people from the field of arts, culture and even business are given their due recognition from the government.</p>
      <p>“I can talk about entertainment tax, how much we contribute. If cinema wasn’t there, a large chunk of money in the national treasury wouldn’t have been there. I am tired of saying this… acknowledge the role of artistes and cinema in the country. But they land on deaf ears, what can I do,” he added.</p>
      <p>Rishi will be next seen in The Body co-starring <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/emraan-hashmi/">Emraan Hashmi</a> and Sobhita Dhulipala. The film is scheduled to be released on December 13.</p>
