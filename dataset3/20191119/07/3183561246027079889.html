      <h3>Deadpool 3</h3>
      <p>Appearing as a guest on <a href="https://adamcarolla.com/tj-miller-and-mark-geragos/?fbclid=IwAR0bzC70EwX7vAzvqx32_DAAihU19FFnZWgB3yzEHSqA7l56yGDs_5ZGSDQ">Adam Carolla’s podcast</a>, T.J. Miller revealed he’s “under contract” to reprise his role as Wade Wilson’s friend, Weasel, in a third <i>Deadpool</i> movie if Disney wants him to.</p>
      <blockquote>Of course, if they want me to do <i>Deadpool 3</i>, I’m going to. I’m under contract.<br/><br/>To be honest, I’d almost would rather that they didn’t. I think <i>Deadpool 2</i>, we knocked it out of the park. I really think it ended up being great and I was worried about that. So what if <i>Deadpool 3</i> is… eh.</blockquote>

      <h3>The Suicide Squad</h3>
      <p>Speaking with <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/margot-robbie-bombshell-suicide-squad-2-bird-of-prey-1203404002/">Variety</a>, Margot Robbie promised James Gunn’s <i>The Suicide Squad</i> is “going to be very, very good.”</p>
      <blockquote>You’re going to be laughing a lot. It’s going to be good is all I can say for now. It’s going to be very, very good.</blockquote>

      <h3>Birds of Prey and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn</h3>
      <p>In the <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/news/margot-robbie-bombshell-suicide-squad-2-bird-of-prey-1203404002/">same article</a>, Robbie described <i>Birds of Prey</i> as a “poppy” and “bonkers” film told entirely from Harley Quinn’s point of view.</p>
      <blockquote>The story in <i>Birds of Prey</i> is told from her point of view, so you have an insight into Harley’s world in a way that you didn’t in the first <i>Suicide Squad</i> film, nor that you’ll have in the next <i>Suicide Squad</i> film. It’s a little bonkers. It reflects her personality. It’s heightened. It’s poppy, it’s fun, it’s violent, it’s crazy. It’s absurd. It’s kooky. It’s hilarious. It’s a little heartbreaking.</blockquote>

      <h3>The Flash</h3>
      <p><a href="https://tvline.com/2019/11/15/the-flash-casts-sue-dearbon-season-6-natalie-dreyfuss/">TV Line</a> reports Natalie Dreyfuss has been cast as the Elongated Man’s future wife, Sue Dearbon. Described as “possessing a fierce intelligence and a spitfire personality” the character is “daughter to one of Central City’s most wealthy families.

      <h3>American Horror Story</h3>
      <p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/american-horror-story-season-10-spoilers-ryan-murphy-ahs-1984-interview-season-finale-ratched-hollywood-streaming-dates-1202785704/">Deadline</a>, Ryan Murphy teased <i>American Horror Story’</i>s tenth season may include several returning “fan-favourite actors” as it “might be our last.”</p>
      <blockquote>We’re working on an idea for season 10 that I think people will love because it’s about reuniting fan-favourite actors to come back — because it might be our last season. <br/><br/>It’s the last season we have contracted. So, I’ve been quietly reaching out to various people. Some people I haven’t reached out to yet because I was like ‘Do I have a role for them?’ So far, everybody I reached out to said ‘Yes’, so that’s been great.”<br/><br/>We’re in the middle of negotiations about beyond season 10. We have had conversations about the show going 20 seasons. If [FX’s John Landgraf] for some reason said, ‘We don’t want to make this anymore’, would I call up Netflix? Yes. But he’s only ever expressed love and enthusiasm and he wants to keep it going. I have every good intention of it staying there and I think he does too. We’re talking about it. We’re trying to figure it out.</blockquote>
