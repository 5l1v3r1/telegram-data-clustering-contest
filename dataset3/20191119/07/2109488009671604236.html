      <h1>PLDT pushes back Voyager turnaround to 2024</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T07:39:49+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 07:39</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/meet-the-team/#josephwaring" target="_blank">Joseph Waring</a></address>
      <p>PLDT chairman and CEO Manuel Pangilinan doesn’t expect its fintech arm Voyager Innovation to make a profit until 2024, after suffering a loss of PHP1.33 billion ($26.2 million) in the first nine months of 2019.</p>
      <p>In March, he predicted the business <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/money/news-money/pldt-expects-voyager-turnaround-by-2021/">would turnaround by 2021</a>. Last year the unit posted a loss of PHP3 billion, up from PHP1.2 billion in 2017.</p>
      <p>Pangilinan forecasts Voyager to break even, cash-wise by 2023, “so by 2024 we would see the light of day”, <i>BusinessWorld</i> reported.</p>
      <p>PLDT’s digital payments unit PayMaya, which is Voyager’s core business, posted strong year-on-year growth in the first nine months of the year.</p>
      <p>The company raised $215 million in new funding in the final quarter of last year. In November 2018, Voyager <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/featured-content/money-home-banner/pldt-vows-financial-inclusion-drive-after-175m-boost/">raised $175 million</a> worth of private investments after selling minority stakes to private equity company KKR and Tencent. A month later, it <a href="https://www.mobileworldlive.com/asia/asia-news/ifc-closes-40m-investment-in-voyager/">closed a $40 million investment</a> from International Finance Corp and IFC Emerging Asia Fund.</p>
      <p>Responding to a question about the possibility of selling more shares in Voyager, Pangilinan said: “I think there’s an effort to raise funding,” the newspaper wrote.</p>
      <p>The Philippines company’s mobile unit Smart Communications had a 43 per cent market share by subscribers at end-September.</p>
