      <h4>Agency Reporter</h4>
      <p>Oyo State Governor Seyi Makinde on Monday kick-started the reconstruction of the 65-kilometre Moniya-Iseyin road in Ibadan, the state capital.</p>
      <p>The project is expected to be completed within 12 months.</p>
      <p>The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the Makinde administration had re-awarded the road contract to Kopek Construction Company at N9.9 billion.</p>
      <p>The governor, last August, revoked the contract for the road, earlier awarded for N7 billion by former Governor Abiola Ajimobi administration.</p>
      <p>Makinde attributed the revocation from the former contractor to its lack of capacity to handle the project.</p>
      <p>The governor said the award of the road was in fulfilment of his campaign promise to the people of Moniya and Iseyin towns.</p>

      <p>He added that the road would enhance the socio-economic development of the state, especially of the people of Oke-Ogun area.</p>
      <p>According to the governor, when completed, the road will address the challenges of moving farm produce from Oke-Ogun axis to Ibadan, the state capital.</p>
      <p>He further disclosed that 60 percent of the contract sum had been paid to the contractor to ease the job.</p>
      <p>“It is expected that the journey from Ibadan to Iseyin will not be more than 45 minutes, when the project is completed.</p>
      <p>“We are going to engage security operatives to be patrolling the road for the protection of the people plying the road when it is completed,” Makinde said.</p>
      <p>He urged the construction company to deliver quality job, saying that the road would be used as standard template for all other roads to be constructed in the state.</p>
      <p>Makinde said for the road to be durable, its asphalt overlay would be 50mm instead of 40mm.</p>
      <p>The governor also implored the construction company to engage the services of youths in the area for the project.</p>
      <p>Also, the Spokesman of Kopek, Mr Pascal Harfouch, assured the governor and the people of the state that quality job would be delivered.</p>
