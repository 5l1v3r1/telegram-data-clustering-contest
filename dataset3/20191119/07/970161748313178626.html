      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/adele/">Adele</a> Roberts had the nation in hysterics when she <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/im-celebrity-fans-baffled-adele-roberts-chooses-framed-photo-jane-mcdonald-luxury-item-11178692/">whipped out a framed photo of Jane McDonald</a> in the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a>… Get Me Out Of Here! jungle last night and now the singer has responded in the best way possible.</p>
      <p>The actress turned Loose Women presenter reached out publicly to Adele and admitted that she was delighted to see that the BBC Radio 1 host had brought her portrait as her luxury item.</p>
      <p>Tweeting her 148,700 followers, Jane wrote: ‘Absolutely thrilled to see my picture in the jungle. @AdeleRoberts I flipping love you. Best of luck.’</p>

      <p>A true queen.</p>
      <p>During an extra task in the ITV show last night, the team at Base Camp were given the opportunity to win meaningful luxury items for each of their fellow contestants by passing them along a row on paddles above a swamp.</p>
      <p>If the item fell in, the chance of winning the prize sank along with it.</p>

      <p>With most of the contestants opting for practical necessities, like James Haskell’s orthopedic pillow, or sweet mementos from home, like Roman Kemp’s picture of his family, the only items to sadly make it through were Kate Garraway’s concealer and Adele’s prize.</p>
      <p>‘Just to let you know what we’re playing for… mine is a picture of somebody really special to me,’ Adele warned her fellow contestants.</p>

      <p>Finding out that the chosen picture was of Jane, the celebrities looked pretty baffled by the choice.</p>
      <p>‘She’s my favourite Loose Woman, she’s going to get me through the jungle, I love her,’ Adele insisted.</p>
      <p>‘She is a national treasure, she is the queen of Wakefield,’ Adele told her pals.</p>

      <p>‘Just think, whenever you’re going off to a trial, just give her a lucky rub and off you go.’</p>
      <p>Each to their own…</p>
