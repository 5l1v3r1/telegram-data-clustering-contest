      <p><b>HONG KONG – </b>Hong Kong police have arrested a 21-year-old Japanese man amid pro-democracy protests in the region, diplomatic sources said Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The man was named as Hikaru Ida, a student at Tokyo University of Agriculture, by Japanese government sources, stating that he was detained Sunday near Hong Kong Polytechnic University in the Kowloon district, where clashes between protesters and police continue.</p>
      <p>“We hear he is in a good state of health with no injuries,” Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The top government spokesman declined to disclose the man’s name or the reason for his detention.</p>
      <p>According to the diplomatic sources, the Japanese Consulate-General in Hong Kong has provided him with assistance.</p>
      <p>Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi, at a separate news conference, said the detained man was not attending school in Hong Kong but was a tourist in the city.</p>
      <p>Ida is the second Japanese national to be arrested in connection with the protests. A Japanese man in his 40s was arrested on Aug. 31, also in relation to the protests in the city, for an unknown reason, but has already been released.</p>
      <p>Japan is concerned about the unrest, and is looking to raise the issue with the Chinese delegation at a Group of 20 meeting of foreign minsters set to be hosted this weekend in Nagoya, Motegi told a news briefing Tuesday.</p>
      <p>About 26,000 Japanese nationals live in Hong Kong, according to the Japanese Consulate.</p>
