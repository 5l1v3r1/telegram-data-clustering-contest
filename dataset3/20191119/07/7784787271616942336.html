      <h3>Delisted Bomber Mitch Brown has an excellent opportunity to push his case to play for a third AFL club, with Melbourne confirming the utility is set to train with the club next month.</h3>

      <p>Melbourne football boss Josh Mahoney confirmed on Tuesday night that Brown would be given the opportunity to train with the club.</p>

      <p>“It’s exciting that Mitch has accepted an invitation to train with us post the draft on December 3,” Mahoney said.</p>
      <p>“Mitch is an experienced versatile tall and has shown that he can perform at AFL level.</p>
      <p>“He is an elite runner and a reliable shot at goal so it will be good to have him around the club during the pre-season.”</p>

      <p>It means Brown won’t be taken as a delisted free agent, but can be picked up during the pre-season supplemental selection period (SSP).</p>
      <p>In a surprise move, Brown was delisted by Essendon just before the first list deadline (October 31), despite a solid 2019 campaign that saw him kick 21 goals in 16 games in 2019, including four hauls of three or more goals.</p>
      <p>Melbourne struggled to kick a winning score in 2019, averaging just 71.3 points per outing — ranked 17th in the AFL. Mid-sized forward Christian Petracca was the club’s top goalkicker with 22 majors — just one more than Brown’s haul for Essendon in 2019.</p>
      <p>Brown played 55 games for the Bombers but was particularly instrumental in his first season at Essendon, playing 21 games while most of the Bombers’ list were sidelined because of the supplements saga. Overall, he’s kicked 68 goals from 70 AFL games.</p>
      <p>However Brown has also been played in defence during his time at both Essendon and Geelong, where he played 15 games.</p>
