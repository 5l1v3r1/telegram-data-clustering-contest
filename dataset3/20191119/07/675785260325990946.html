      <h1>EasyJet's profits tumble as airline vows to deliver better value package holidays</h1>
      <h2>The budget airline said it was hit by higher fuel costs, but announced a push into the package holiday market following the collapse of Thomas Cook</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T07:55:07+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 07:55</time> by <a rel="author">Emma Munbodh, https://www.facebook.com/EmmaMunbodh</a></address>
      <p>EasyJet has seen profits dive, despite record passenger numbers in the year to September, after being hit by higher fuel prices and a drop in consumer spending.</p>
      <p>The budget airline reported a 26% drop in pre-tax profits to £427 million for the 12 months to September 30.</p>
      <p>The travel giant reported the profit decline as it also announced plans to move further into the package holiday market ahead of Christmas, following the collapse of major rival Thomas Cook.</p>
      <p>Johan Lundgren, chief executive of EasyJet, said: "I am really thrilled that with the launch, before Christmas, of our brand new EasyJet Holidays business we are bringing flexibility and excellent value to the holiday market.</p>

      <p>"We believe there is a gap in the market for a modern, relevant and flexible business for today's consumer."</p>
      <p>Boss Lundgren added that there are now plans to make the airline the world’s first to operate net-zero carbon flights across its entire network.</p>
      <p>"We are doing this by offsetting the carbon emissions from the fuel used for all of our flights. We recognise that offsetting is only an interim measure, but we want to take action on our carbon emissions now. "</p>
      <p>The news comes just weeks after the airline blew £36million on failed airline Thomas Cook's slots at Gatwick and Bristol airports.</p>
      <p>The deal means 12 more summer slot pairs and 8 more winter slot pairs at Gatwick and 6 more summer slots and one extra winter slot pair at Bristol.</p>
      <p>Airport slots allow an airline to schedule a landing or departure during a specific time period - this means that easyJet's purchase of Thomas Cook's old ones will allow it to schedule more flights.</p>
      <p>Last month, independent travel agent Hays Travel said it would buy all 555 remaining high street stores from Thomas Cook and re-employ hold of as many of its staff as possible.</p>
      <p>Ryanair is also getting in on the action, using the opportunity to grow its Austrian brand Lauda by picking up pilots and planes.</p>
      <p>"With A320 aircraft and pilots recently released from the failure of Thomas Cook and Adria Airways, Lauda plans to grow from a fleet of 23 A320s in Spring-summer 209 to 38 for spring-summer 2020," Ryanair said earlier this month.</p>
