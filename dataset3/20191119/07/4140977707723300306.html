                  <i>“I had barely signed my contract with PSG when Zlatan called me: ‘Thiago, are you really going to sign for PSG? Yes, I have just signed here. After the Olympics I will arrive in Paris.’ He said to me: ‘For real? If you are not coming, I will not sign. And if you have lied, you will see, I will take care of you!’ I reassured him and I above all said to him that I was happy that he will be part of this project… Zlatan is a fantastic guy with whom I speak very regularly.”</i>

                      <p>The departure of the duo and a host of other stars signalled the beginning of the fall of AC Milan. Many Milan fans look back on that summer as the one which changed the course of the club’s recent past, as they finished 3rd in 2012-13, 8th in 2013-14, 10th in 2014-15 and 7th in 2015-16.</p>
                      <p>While the fans in Milan have been ruing his departure, Thiago Silva has not regretted his move at all. In fact, he says that he feels French and has proclaimed the country his second home.</p>

                            <i>“Today, after eight years here, with the passport in my pocket, I feel French. I’m proud of it. Paris is not a parenthesis. It’s a part of my life (…) Paris is in my story. Nobody can take it away. I feel French, beyond the passport. Today, I’m Brazilian, born in Rio de Janeiro, but my second home is Paris. Nobody can change that. I’ll be Parisian for life. “</i>
