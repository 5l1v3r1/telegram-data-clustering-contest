      <p>The Live at the Marquee series will end after 2020 as the site will be designated for homes.</p>
      <p>Developers plan to start building on the docklands site at the end of next summer which will spell the end of the annual concerts.</p>
      <p>Live at the Marquee has been running since 2005 which acts like Elton John, Lady Gaga and Bruce Springsteen all performing at the venue.</p>
      <p>Glenveagh Properties, who own the site, plan to build up to 1,000 homes on the plot near the River Lee.</p>
