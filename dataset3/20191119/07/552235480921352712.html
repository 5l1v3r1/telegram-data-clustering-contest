      <h1>Daniel Arzani 'poised for Celtic stay' as Manchester City talent sets comeback date</h1>
      <h2>The Australia international's stint at Parkhead thus far has been ravaged by a cruel ACL injury.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T07:46:05+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 07:46</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Bryce, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/liam-bryce/</a></address>
      <p>Celtic and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/daniel-arzani">Daniel Arzani</a> are keen to extend the Aussie winger's loan deal, according to a report.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> prospect moved to Parkhead in August 2018 but suffered a devastating ACL injury on his first-team debut just under three months later.</p>
      <p>He's yet to feature under <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/neil-lennon">Neil Lennon</a> but <a href="https://theworldgame.sbs.com.au/vote-of-confidence-for-arzani-as-celtic-bid-to-extend-loan-deal">The World Game</a> report the manager has seen enough in training and development matches to open talks over keeping Arzani until 2021.</p>
      <p>His current arrangement is set to expire at the end of this season, by which time the 20-year-old hopes to have returned to full fitness.</p>
      <p>It's reported he has set the Boxing Day clash with St Mirren as a potential comeback date, having been struck down a bout of patella tendonitis amid his long-term recovery from knee surgery.</p>

      <p>An agreement is yet to be reached but it's believed Arzani is keen to stay and make a long awaited impact.</p>
      <p>However, even if his loan is prolonged beyond the end of the season, Arzani could miss more Celtic games in January.</p>
      <p>Ahead of qualifying clashes between January 8-26, Australia's Olympic caretaker boss Gary van Egmond revealed in September that Arzani will be considered for selection if he is fit.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>However, any impact on <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/celtic-fc">Celtic</a> is likely to be minimal, with the Premiership entering its winter shutdown from January 9-17.</p>
      <p>Van Egmond said: "It depends where he’s at in terms of his fitness, but if he’s good to go then in this age group he’s very important in terms of where he’s playing and the level he’s at.</p>
      <p>"He could have a big bearing on the team and how it progresses from here. We’ll obviously he guided by the medics in terms of where he’s up to to ensure the best outcome for him.</p>
      <p>"But all the overseas boys have expressed just how much they want to be involved in the Olympics.”</p>
