      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kate-garraway/">Kate Garraway</a>’s children persuaded her to take part in the new series of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity…Get Me Out Of Here!</a></p>
      <p>The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/good-morning-britain/">Good Morning Britain</a> presenter is taking part in this year’s installment alongside reality TV icon <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/caitlyn-jenner/">Caitlyn Jenner</a> and pop singer <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/nadine-coyle/">Nadine Coyle</a>.</p>
      <p>And it turns out we have her children to thank, as they were the ones who got her on the plane to Australia in the first place.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Hello before she headed out to the jungle, Garraway said her youngsters, Darcey and Bill, really, really wanted to see their mum eat bugs live on TV.</p>
      <p>‘Darcey really got into the last few series,’ the 52 year-old said. ‘[She] kept saying “You should so do this mum.”‘</p>
      <p>She also apparently had a very… unique approach to training for life in the jungle.</p>

      <p>‘[She said] things like ‘You should eat that slug from the garden, or jump off of that wall, to practice,”‘ Garraway continued. ‘It’s been a war of attrition.’</p>

      <p>Well, that’s one way to be prepared.</p>
      <p>Garraway also admitted to the publication that she may be apprehensive of entering the jungle (and has a fear of snakes! We’ll sure that’ll end well) but she’s ready for all the challenges – and the benefits – that come from taking part in the reality show.</p>
      <p>She continued: ‘It is an incredible show and also you get to meet extraordinary people. I’ve never met anyone who said they regretted doing it.</p>
      <p>‘People say it’s absolutely life-changing and you get so much peace from being out of contact with the world.’</p>

      <p>We don’t how much peace will be coming her way, though.</p>
      <p>The show’s big coup this year, Caitlyn Jenner, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/caitlyn-jenner-opens-up-about-transitioning-after-threatening-to-quit-im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here-on-day-two-11178492/">has already broken down in tears and considered quitting</a> on her second day in the jungle.</p>
      <p>And <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/im-celebrity-2019-kate-garraway-another-nightmare-bushtucker-trial-caitlyn-jenner-11174977/">Garraway herself has already had to endure another terrifying Bush Tucker trial</a> alongside the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star.</p>
