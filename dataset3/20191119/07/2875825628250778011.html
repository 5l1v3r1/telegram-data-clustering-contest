      <h2>Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino is under increasing pressure after a poor start to the season, with his side languishing in 14th in the table</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T07:03:29+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 07:03</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Tottenham have reportedly lined up three managers to replace boss Mauricio Pochettino.</p>
      <p>The Spurs boss' future is growing increasingly unclear after a disappointing start to the season left the Champions League finalists in 14th in the Premier League.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> take on <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> this weekend and speculation continues that Pochettino could well be on his way out of the club.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7699319/Time-running-Mauricio-Pochettino-just-matter-leaves-Tottenham.html">The Mail reports</a> there are fears in the boardroom over the current malaise and it now appears a case of when, not if, Pochettino will leave the club.</p>

      <p>It is claimed Tottenham have drawn up a shortlist of managers to come in, although they accept it will be difficult to land them mid-season.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> boss Eddie Howe is believed to be a contender with his side having enjoyed a decent start to the season.</p>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> boss Carlo Ancelotti is also well-liked within the Spurs boardroom but there are doubts over whether he would leave Napoli at this stage.</p>
      <p>Ancelotti, 60, has reportedly been identified as a potential manager for David Beckham's MLS side Inter Miami next season.</p>

      <p>RB Leipzig boss Julian Nagelsmann is another name tipped to be in contention to replace Pochettino.</p>
      <p>The 32-year-old has done an excellent job in Germany and has been reportedly earmarked as a future Bayern Munich boss.</p>
      <p>Tottenham could fall as low as 17th if they lose to West Ham this weekend, although a win would see them climb considerably up the table.</p>
