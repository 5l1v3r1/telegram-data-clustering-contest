      <h2>After years of waiting, millions of pounds spent and months of political arguing about where it should be built - plans for an arena in Bristol take a major step forward</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T07:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Kate Wilson</a></address>
      <p>First proposed 16 years ago, the road to an <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-arena">arena</a> for Bristol has been long and arduous to say the least.</p>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-mayor">Bristol Mayor</a> George Ferguson played a key role in identifying the Temple Quay location and the deal was weeks away from being signed back in 2016.</p>
      <p>But a row over a lack of car parking spaces delayed the project and meant Mr Ferguson could not firm up the contract before the mayoral election that year.</p>

      <p>After beating Mr Ferguson, current mayor <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/marvin-rees">Marvin Rees</a> paused the project and launched a ‘value for money’ assessment last spring over fears of mounting costs with the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-centre">city centre</a> site.</p>
      <p>Following the publication of the KPMG report, Mr Rees <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/bristol-arena-not-city-centre-1968999">officially scrapped plans for an arena at Temple Island in September</a>, despite the council sinking £12million in to clearing and preparing it for the concert venue.</p>
      <p>Instead the council said it would push forward with plans for a ‘mixed use’ development on the site which may include a conference centre, housing, offices and shops.</p>

      <p>In that time Malaysian investment firm <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/ytl">YTL</a> has been working on its own proposals to build an arena complex at the Brarbazon hangar site in Filton.</p>
      <p>The firm has now <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/filton-arena-plans-ytl-bristol-3551372">submitted a planning application for the site</a> and revealed its plans for an arena on the edge of the city.</p>
      <p>It's been a long and winding road to get to this point. Below is a timeline of all the twists and turns in the tale of trying to get an arena for Bristol.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <mark>Time Line</mark>
      </p>
      <h3>Bristol Arena Timeline</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h4>2003</h4>
          <p>Plans for an arena for Bristol were first proposed in 2003 with the aim of having it completed by 2008.</p>
          <p>It was agreed that the arena should be built on brownfield site near Bristol Temple Meads station, on the former Bristol Bath Road depot land.</p>
          <p>The arena was originally planned to have a 10,000 capacity.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>2004</h4>
          <p>Bristol City Council buys nine acres of land next to Bristol Temple Meads station for £13million</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>2007</h4>
          <p>Fears of the spiralling cost of the area are raised in June 2007.</p>
          <p>In December the plans are shelved after a report predicts that the project will come to £86million.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>2009</h4>
          <p>The quest for an arena in the city was given a new lease of life in 2009 when plans for a 15,000 capacity venue were proposed in Ashton Vale, close to where Bristol City wanted to build a new stadium.</p>
          <p>This was originally supported by the council, however architect and future Mayor, George Ferguson, lobbied the council to use the original Temple Meads plan.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>2012</h4>
          <p>After several reports the council again changed its mind on the location of the arena and reverted back to the original site in Temple Meads.</p>
          <p>The then Liberal Democrat controlled council said it would fund the project through a Bristol Bond.</p>
          <p>After his election in November 2012, Bristol Mayor, George Ferguson gave new impetus to the plans and said the Bristol Arena was one of the main priorities for his administration.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>2013</h4>
          <p>In January 2013 Mr Ferguson launched a competition for architects to submit designs for the Bristol Arena.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>2014</h4>
          <p>Plans for a 12,000 capacity arena near Temple Meads were approved by Bristol City Council in February 2014.</p>
          <p>It was agreed that £53million - the bulk of funding - would come from the West of England Local Enterprise Partnership City Deal and the remaining £38million would be loaned to the council by the lease operator.</p>
          <p>Mr Ferguson predicted that the arena will be open by 2017.</p>
          <p>A design by architectural firm, Populous, was voted as the favourite for the venue by the people of Bristol.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>2015</h4>
          <p>Costs for the Arena jump by 16 per cent bringing the total to £93 million.</p>
          <p>The project is pushed back to 2018.</p>
          <p>Councillors also raised concerns over parking provisions at the area, with only 45 permanent spaces planned for the city centre venue.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>2016</h4>
          <p>In January plans for an eight-storey, 500 space car park, were added to the arena brief with the aim of dispelling parking fears.</p>
          <p>In March the council delayed the final approval of arena plans citing a lack of clarity.</p>
          <p>It was also suggested that Mr Ferguson was attempting to push through approval to aid his election campaign.</p>
          <p>In response, the former Mayor accused the committee of playing "party politics".</p>
          <p>The plans were finally approved five weeks later, however the delay added an extra £400,000 on to the cost of the project.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>January 2017</h4>
          <p>Bristol City Council axe contractors Bouygues UK Limited after an agreement on price could not be reached.</p>
          <p>Bristol Mayor, Marvin Rees, released a statement assuring the public that the arena would go ahead, but had to be the right price.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>March 2017</h4>
          <p>Papers released for Bristol City Council cabinet meeting in which councillors are recommended to approve Buckingham Group as new arena contractors.</p>
          <p>Officers say three options will be left to the council if it cannot agree a price with Buckingham Group: drawing new plans for the arena, reducing arena capacity or shelving the project.</p>
          <p>The council will also have to rethink parking plans for the arena after it sold the former Royal Mail sorting office - the site originally designated for an arena car park - to Bristol University.</p>
          <p>The cost for the arena and supporting infrastructure now stands at £123.5million.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>April 2017</h4>
          <p>Buckingham Group approved as new arena contractors.</p>
          <p>Marvin Rees launches 'value for money' assessment to assess the future of the arena.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>November 2017</h4>
          <p>Marvin Rees extends the 'value for money' assessment and goes back to the drawing board saying "nothing is off the table" including private investment, a new site or a a new design.</p>
          <p>The Bristol Post reveals the council is considering moving the arena to the Brabazon hangar in Filton Airfield.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>January 2018</h4>
          <p>Bristol City Council publicly admits it is considering YTL's offer and the bid will be included in it's value for money assessment.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>March 2018</h4>
          <p>Bristol's Green Group put forward a motion in Full Council to keep the venue in the city centre. Several Labour councillors blasted the motion for being "inappropriate", but despite the protestations it was <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/bristol-arena-how-councillors-voted-1371010">passed by 34 to 12 votes with 17 abstentions</a>.</p>
          <p>A 4,500 strong public petition in support of Temple Island was also submitted to the council.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>April 2018</h4>
          <p>A decision on the location of Bristol Arena is <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/bristol-arena-decision-delayed-again-1451726">delayed to allow Bristol City Council's scrutiny committee to review the 'value for money' assessment</a>.</p>
          <p>The announcement was due to be made on Tuesday, May 1.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>June 12, 2018</h4>
          <p>The <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/city-centre-bristol-arena-cost-1665247">'value for money' assessment in to Arena Island and Filton Airfield is published</a>.</p>
          <p>The KPMG report states the cost of building the concert venue on the city centre site had risen by £65million to £188.6million.</p>
          <p>The auditors claim an arena on Temple Island would be profitable, however the land would provide more money and jobs if it was used for a conference centre, housing and shops.</p>
          <p>The financial experts warn of potential "economic leakage" from the city centre if the arena is moved to north Bristol.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h4>June 19, 2018</h4>
          <p>A week long scrutiny session begins in to the 'value for money report'.</p>
          <p>The committee is told contractors, Buckingham Group, can build the arena in the city centre for the pre-arranged sum of £122million.</p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/its-arena-island-say-councillors-1706765">Councillors eventually recommend the venue should remain on Temple Island.</a>
          </p>

        <li>

          <p>Bristol Mayor, Marvin Rees, announces he will <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/marvin-rees-delays-bristol-arena-1713008">delay making a decision on the arena </a>site again to consider "new information".</p>
