      <p>Cape Town - <b>Bidvest Wits</b> coach <b>Gavin Hunt</b> believes his team face a tough schedule in the month of January as they catch up on their games in the league season.</p>
      <p>The Clever Boys are currently fifth in the Absa Premiership standings, 13 points behind log leaders Kaizer Chiefs but they have played four matches less than Amakhosi.</p>
      <p>Wits will play most their games in hand in the first month of the new year while Hunt's charges are also participating in the CAF Confederation Cup.</p>
      <p>In quotes published on <a href="https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/local/categories/south-africa/hunt-on-wits-playing-catch-up/667672">Soccer Laduma</a>, Hunt said: "We are going to get hurt in January.</p>
      <p>"We have got nine games, which are obviously our catch-up matches - and that is our problem.</p>
      <p>"But it is what it is. We got knocked out of the cups early and we are not playing and obviously, we have CAF commitments as well.</p>
      <p>"But there were times we could have played, although obviously other teams were playing. It was a bit of a balls-up, but anyway it is what it is."</p>
      <p>Wits lost their last league game before the international break, 1-0 to SuperSport United, a result Hunt feels deflated his team.</p>
      <p>Hunt continued: "The games in hand mean nothing. We had a game in hand last week and we lost. Not everybody has played the same amount of games.</p>
      <p>"You can't really get a good perspective of the league. It's only the truth. We had a good start and last week was a dampener because winning would have taken us up the table.</p>
      <p>"I don't actually look at the log table because it's not proper. I look at how many we have played and what we have done."</p>
      <p>When the Premiership resumes following a two-week international break, Wits take on Highlands Park at Makhulong Stadium on Tuesday, November 26.</p>
