      <h1>Bafana ‘Can’t Be Happy, But…’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T07:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Soccer Laduma</a></address>
      <p>A win is a win, as they say, but Thulani Hlatshwayo has admitted that Bafana Bafana aren’t completely happy with the fact that they only scored once against Sudan at the weekend.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Watch: <a href="https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/local/categories/bafana/lebogang-phiri-was-the-hero-for-bafana-on-sunday/667651">Phiri’s Piledriver For Bafana</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>‘Tyson’ was at the heart of Bafana’s defence once again on Sunday afternoon as the captain led Molefi Ntseki’s troops out to battle against the Sudanese at Orlando Stadium, with Lebogang Phiri’s single goal proving to be the difference as South Africa picked up the first three points of their 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying campaign.</p>
      <p>Ntseki’s side had plenty of chances to put the game to bed over 90 minutes, and also had a goal disallowed – correctly – for offside in the final 10 minutes, but it was Phiri’s goal just before the stroke of half-time that gave them the victory.</p>
      <p>Speaking to the media after the game, the Bafana skipper insisted that the win was the most important thing, saying, “The most important thing for us was to recover… Yes, we can’t be happy with the performance overall because we could have scored more goals, but we’re happy with the three points that we’ve got.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, when asked about a change of partner at centre back after Erick Mathoho replaced Buhle Mkhwanazi, Hlatshwayo added, “Everyone is important in the team… I’m happy for Tower to have come in, though the coach didn’t really explain why he took Buhle out, but it’s a country, everyone is putting their hands up.”</p>

      </p>
      <p>Bafana now have a lengthy break before Ntseki will get to work with them again as they wait for March’s 2022 World Cup qualifiers, and they will be pleased to go into that period on the back of a win. </p>
