      <p>EFRAT, West Bank (AP) — Israel’s prime minister has traveled to the West Bank to celebrate the U.S.’s announcement that it does not consider Israeli settlements to be a violation of international law.</p>
      <p>Benjamin Netanyahu called the Trump administration’s declaration a “huge achievement” that “fixed a historic wrong.”</p>
      <p>“I think it is a great day for the state of Israel and an achievement that will remain for decades,” he said.</p>
      <p>Netanyahu spoke Tuesday at a gathering of ecstatic supporters and settler leaders in Efrat, a large settlement outside of Jerusalem.</p>
      <p>The Palestinians, who claim the West Bank as part of a future state, say the move undercuts any chances of a broader peace deal.</p>
