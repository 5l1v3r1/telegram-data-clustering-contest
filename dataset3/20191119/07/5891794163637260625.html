      <p>Pakistan's ailing former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has left the eastern city of Lahore to receive medical treatment in London.</p>
      <p>Sharif departed on a special plane from on November 19, after the Lahore High Court last week allowed him to seek medical treatment abroad.</p>
      <p>He was accompanied by his brother Shehbaz Sharif, leader of the opposition Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party, and a team of doctors, and paramedics.</p>
      <p>Sharif will travel via the Qatari capital, Doha, in a "high-end Air Ambulance equipped with a fully functional &amp; staffed Intensive Care Unit (ICU) &amp; Operation Theatre (OT)," his personal physician, Adnan Khan, <b><a href="https://twitter.com/Dr_Khan/status/1196305862551310336">tweeted</a></b> on November 17.</p>
      <p>Ahead of his departure, Sharif was administered steroids and medicines to ensure that his condition remains stable during travel, according to PML-N spokeswoman Marriyum Aurangzeb.</p>
      <p>Sharif, who was sentenced earlier this year to seven years in prison on corruption charges, was <b><a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/pakistan-s-jailed-ex-prime-minister-sharif-rushed-to-hospital/30229459.html">rushed from his cell</a></b> to a hospital in Lahore on October 21 after his health deteriorated.</p>
      <p>The Islamabad High Court on October 29 <b><a href="https://www.rferl.org/a/pakistani-court-extend-bail-of-critically-unwell-ex-prime-minister-sharif/30242867.html">suspended his conviction</a></b> for two months on medical grounds.</p>
      <p>While in hospital, the 69-year-old Sharif was diagnosed with an immune-system disorder. He is also on drugs for a cardiac problem, and suffers from diabetes and kidney issues.</p>
      <p>Sharif, a three-time prime minister, was removed from office by the Supreme Court in 2017 over corruption allegations.</p>
      <p>He has denied the charges, saying they are politically motivated.</p>
