      <h1>Gareth Bale says Wales can use agony and ecstasy to help them beat Hungary</h1>
      <h2>A win for Wales at the Cardiff City Stadium will see them qualify for Euro 2020 and Bale has experienced a number of highs and lows while representing his country</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T07:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">James Nursey, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/james-nursey/</a></address>
      <p>Gareth Bale says Wales will use the pleasure and pain of their previous experience in crunch qualifiers to inspire them tonight.</p>
      <p>Ryan Giggs' side host Hungary at a sell-out 33,000-capacity <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/cardiff-city-fc">Cardiff</a> City Stadium knowing victory will clinch second in Group E to send them to Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>Wales made the last four of the previous tournament in 2016 after memorably reaching their first finals since the 1958 World Cup.</p>
      <p>But the nation then failed to make last year's World Cup when they lost their final qualifier at home to the Republic of Ireland.</p>
      <p>And skipper Bale knows which emotion he wants to repeat again this evening.</p>

      <p>Bale, 30, reflected: “We have the experience of what we have gone through. I think we can use both of them to our advantage.</p>
      <p>“We have got the kind of euphoria of qualifying for our first Euros and doing so well at the competition that we really want to do that again.</p>
      <p>“We’ve also got the negatives of knowing how it feels to miss out on qualifying for a tournament like we did for the World Cup so we can use both of them to our advantage.</p>
      <p>“We don’t want to be feeling like we did after the Ireland game. It's not a feeling you want in the dressing room after the game.</p>
      <p>"We will be using all of our experience to try and navigate our way through and we’ll be giving 100% as always to try and win the game.”</p>

      <p>Wales go into tonight's crunch game in good form after turning their prospects around since back-to-back summer losses in Croatia and Hungary.</p>
      <p>Boss Giggs has since introduced 6ft 5in targetman Kieffer Moore as they have drawn with Slovakia and Croatia and beaten Azerbaijan to rekindle their automatic qualification hopes.</p>
      <p>Wigan striker Moore has scored twice and helped hold the ball up to bring the likes of Bale, Dan James and Harry Wilson into play.</p>
      <p>Bale feels Wales are carrying more of a threat from all over the pitch since their last Euro qualifiers when he produced seven goals and two assists for Wales' 11 goals.</p>
      <p>Wales' record-scorer with 32 goals in 82 caps, assessed: “Now we've got more attacking options which is good. To qualify is the main goal and you can't qualify with one player.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>“It's a big team effort and it's good that we're all chipping in and working for each other. Whenever I play I just always try to give 100 per cent, whether I am scoring or defending.</p>
      <p>“If I manage to score more goals than others then good but if I don't then hopefully someone else is scoring them.”</p>
      <p>Bale badly mis-cued a chance in Budapest in June when it was 0-0 before the visitors crashed to a 1–0 defeat which could prove very costly if they fall short tonight.</p>
      <p>Bale said: “It was a chance I would like to have taken but these things happen. I've forgotten about that now, it's about Tuesday's game and if I have a chance hopefully I can stick it away to win the game.</p>
      <p>“It’s been an up and down campaign but it's always better to start a little bit worse than finishing badly because you know you’ve got time to resurrect things.</p>

      <p>“The most important thing now is that we haven’t lost since we went to Hungary and we’ve been on that upward trajectory. We have to keep riding that wave. We know how big of a game it is on Tuesday and we’ll be ready to give a big performance.”</p>
      <p>Victory will spark huge celebrations - anything less than three points will condemn Wales to the play-offs in March</p>
