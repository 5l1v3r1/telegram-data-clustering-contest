      <p>A seven-year-old child has written a letter to Father Christmas asking for a house and food for her family.</p>
      <p>The message was handed in to a "Santa postbox" at the cafe of a community centre in Liverpool.</p>
      <p>It read "Dear Father Christmas. Can you help? Can we have a home for Christmas?</p>
      <p>"Mam wants us to be all together, can you give us some food and can I just have just nice doll for Christmas. Thank you".</p>

      <p>The team at Everton's L6 Community Centre say they are trying their best to help the family with basic needs such as accommodation and food.</p>
      <p>They say they're had more than 100 referrals, and notes like these show how much some families in Merseyside are struggling.</p>
      <p>A local footballer was also touched by the note and has offered to help.</p>
      <p>The player, in his 20s, branded the situation a "disgrace" and said that the thought that some children go without "kills him".</p>
      <p>He added: "I want to help so that this child can feel special and equal to other kids because they’re not inferior and may feel they’re a bad child as everyone says if you're good Father Christmas will get you what you ask for."</p>

      <blockquote>No wonder young people have mental health problems, it's just so sad. Unfortunately it is what we see at the L6 centre.<br/>This is just one of many that we're going to see from now until Christmas.<cite>– Councillor Gerard Woodhouse</cite></blockquote>
