      <h1>Man reportedly ran away naked on Denpasar street after failed robbery and rape attempt</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T07:02:42+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 07:02</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Bali" target="_blank">Coconuts Bali</a></address>
      <p>After getting caught in a robbery and rape attempt of a female college student, a 22-year-old man reportedly ran away naked on the street before he was later caught by the police. </p>
      <p>The incident reportedly took place around 2.30am on Nov. 13 at a boarding house in Denpasar. </p>
      <p>“The suspect entered the victim’s room through the window, with the intent to steal. But he didn’t find anything valuable,” I Wayan Arta Ariawan from the Denpasar Police explained, <a href="https://baliexpress.jawapos.com/read/2019/11/18/166398/gagal-perkosa-gadis-cantik-di-jl-singosari-yahya-lari-telanjang">as quoted by <i>Bali Express. </i></a></p>
      <p>Upon noticing that the victim, identified by her initials SS, was still asleep, Ariawan said that the suspect, who has been identified as Achmad Yahya Nurrochim, then took off his clothes and approached her bed. </p>
      <p>SS woke up when he was on her side and began screaming when she realized the presence of a naked stranger. </p>
      <p>“The victim then started shouting … The suspect tried to cover her mouth. But she fought back, and began shouting even louder,” Ariawan said. </p>
      <p>Achmad then ran away from SS’ room naked, leaving behind all his clothes. It doesn’t seem like many people saw him, as the incident occurred at dawn.  </p>
      <p>SS filed a report to the Denpasar Police soon after and authorities were able to track Achmad down and arrested him that same afternoon. </p>
      <p>Ariawan said Achmad confessed to his crimes during interrogation. Under Indonesia’s criminal code, the suspect faces a maximum sentence of 12 years in prison for the alleged rape attempt.</p>
