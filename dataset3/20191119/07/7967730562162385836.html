      <h1>Policeman accused of neglecting duty over sexual predator did what was required, court told</h1>

      <p>A NSW policeman who allegedly failed to properly investigate explicit phone calls made by a paroled sex offender or report them to Corrective Services did what was required of him, his barrister has told a court.</p>
      <p>Andrew Michael Bruce, 32, was a leading senior constable at Kogarah in Sydney's south in October 2018 when a woman reported receiving sexually harassing calls from a stranger. His investigation revealed the perpetrator was 55-year-old Anthony Peter Sampieri.</p>

      <p>Less than two weeks later, <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p538c5.html">Sampieri sexually assaulted a seven-year-old girl</a> in the bathroom of a dance studio in Sydney's south and stabbed a man who came to the child's aid.</p>
      <p>The Crown <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p53bj0.html">alleges Senior Constable Bruce neglected his duty</a> by failing to look at Sampieri's full criminal record – which contained serious sex offences – when he investigated the phone calls. He is also accused of failing to notify community corrections staff about the allegations.</p>
      <p>Senior Constable Bruce, who is suspended with pay, has pleaded not guilty.</p>
      <p>A hearing in Downing Centre Local Court was told Senior Constable Bruce and another officer went to Sampieri's home eight days before the girl was assaulted and warned him to stop making explicit calls to a female real estate agent.</p>

      <p>"Cut it out and there won't be any more issues," the officer was recorded saying on his body camera. "You won't see me again."</p>
      <p>The officers also told Sampieri's mother he wasn't in trouble.</p>
      <p>Crown prosecutor Sally Stuart said on Tuesday a warning appeared on Sampieri's profile in the police database system, which detailed that he was on parole and any "adverse contact" with him should be reported to community corrections.</p>

      <p>Ms Stuart said a "prudent investigating officer" would have looked into the matter further.</p>
      <p>She said Senior Constable Bruce in effect admitted he did not read Sampieri's history properly because he said he was not in trouble, and told the phone call complainant Sampieri had a "minor" criminal history.</p>
      <p>"Nobody, having read the criminal history, could say that the man had a minor record," Ms Stuart said.</p>
      <p>But defence barrister Linda Barnes said none of the things her client did were admissions and he could not have revealed Sampieri's criminal record due to privacy laws.</p>
      <p>Ms Barnes said the Crown could not prove Senior Constable Bruce had a "positive duty" to act on the request from community corrections.</p>
      <p>"It's going to come down to legal meanings of words, but at the moment there is no evidence that there is a duty," Ms Barnes said.</p>
      <p>She said her client went out to speak to Sampieri "knowing that the complainant just wants the calls to stop" and proceeded to ask Sampieri to stop.</p>
      <p>"It's exactly what [the woman] wanted done," Ms Barnes said. "Everything here, he's done what's required of him."</p>
      <p>Ms Barnes said there are "flaws" in the Crown case in relation to the allegation that her client failed to properly investigate, and those flaws flowed on to the allegation of failing to inform Corrective Services.</p>
      <p>Sampieri's parole officer told the court on Monday that she contacted NSW Police several times in 2018 to ask for an "intel check" on him, which would reveal contact he had with officers.</p>
      <p>The last check was requested and delivered on October 29, several days after the calls were reported. However, police had not yet identified Sampieri as the culprit.</p>
      <p>The hearing continues.</p>
