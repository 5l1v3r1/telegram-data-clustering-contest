      <p>AUSTIN, Texas (<a href="https://cbsaustin.com/news/nation-world/vegan-man-sues-burger-king-over-impossible-whopper-being-cooked-alongside-meat">KEYE</a>) -- A vegan man is suing Burger King because its new meatless Impossible Whopper is cooked alongside other meat products, according to the lawsuit.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/19/business/burger-king-impossible-burger-lawsuit-trnd/index.html">CNN Business reports</a> that Phillip Williams, the plaintiff in the case, is a vegan who does not eat or drink anything that uses animal by-products.</p>
      <p>Williams filed the class action lawsuit Monday in the Southern District of Florida. It claims that the though the Impossible Whopper is advertised as "meat-free," it isn't vegan because it's cooked on the same grill as meat products.</p>
      <p>The suit accuses Burger King of false advertising, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/19/business/burger-king-impossible-burger-lawsuit-trnd/index.html">CNN reports</a>, as well as "benefiting monetarily from offering a vegan option that is not in fact vegan."</p>
