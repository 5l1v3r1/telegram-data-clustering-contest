      <p>Cosmetics firm Coty has bought a majority share in Kylie Jenner’s cosmetics empire, netting the social media maven and reality TV star another fortune.</p>
      <p>The acquisition is part of Coty’s strategy to tap into the reality TV star and social media phenomenon’s massive online reach and is expected to drive company shares up by 5 per cent.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old star of <i>Keeping Up With The Kardashians,</i> which is<a href="https://www.foxtel.com.au/now/index.html?utm_source=news.com.au&amp;utm_medium=textlink&amp;utm_campaign=tv-drama&amp;utm_content=NCAFoxtelEditorial"> streaming its new season on Foxtel Now</a>, is the youngest ever self-made billionaire thanks to her cosmetics company, according to <i>Forbes.</i></p>
      <p>The move comes as the cosmetics giant, which is also the owner of the CoverGirl brand, strengthens its commitment to skin care while attempting to combat declining sales.</p>
      <p>The deal aims to be a long-term strategic partnership that will jointly build and further develop Jenner’s existing beauty business, taking it to the next level globally.</p>
      <p>Coty and Kylie will work together, focusing on global expansion into new beauty categories and markets.</p>

      <p>The transaction is also a step in Coty’s ongoing transformation from a 115-year-old empire into a more focused and digitally agile company.</p>
      <p>The deal is expected to close in the third quarter of fiscal year 2020, Coty said.</p>
      <p>Business Wire reported Jenner announced: “I’m excited to partner with Coty to continue to reach even more fans of Kylie Cosmetics and Kylie Skin around the world.</p>
      <p>“I look forward to continuing the creativity and ingenuity for each collection that consumers have come to expect and engaging with my fans across social media,” said Jenner who announced on Instagram her beauty collection for Christmas.</p>
      <p>“This partnership will allow me and my team to stay focused on the creation and development of each product while building the brand into an international beauty powerhouse.”</p>
      <p>What does Coty get for $600 million? Exactly 51 per cent ownership in the partnership — and the expectation that revenue will grow across its core portfolios by more than 1 per cent in the next three years.</p>
      <p>All Coty and Kylie beauty categories within the new partnership will continue to be sold through leading beauty retailers as well as owned digital channels.</p>
