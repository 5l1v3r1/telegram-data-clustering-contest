        <li>Hundreds of protesters surrendered to police after a days-long siege of the Polytechnic University in Hong Kong.</li>
        <li>Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam announced in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhWvB3ssP54">a press conference on Tuesday</a> that 600 people left the university campus – 400 of whom were arrested and 200 of whom were let go for being under 18.</li>
        <li>The seige had become the latest flashpoint in a months-long running battle between Hong Kong authorities, backed by China, and vast numbers of protesters.</li>
        <li>The campus stand-off saw police blockade the protesters in, and use tear gas on those inside. Protesters threw rocks and Molotov cocktails at officers.</li>
        <li>The mass surrender represented a victory for authorities, who have emphasized their desire to prosecute those involved.</li>
        <li>A hard core of around 100 people, who refused to surrender, remained at the university.</li>

      <p>Hundreds of protesters in Hong Kong surrendered to police on Tuesday following a days-long siege at the Polytechnic University which had become the city’s latest flashpoint.</p>
      <p>Around 600 people gave themselves up at the campus in Hung Hom, which had become a <a href="https://www.insider.com/photos-videos-protests-hong-kong-polytechnic-university-tear-gas-arrows-2019-11">battleground for pro-democracy protesters</a> against the police over the weekend,</p>
      <p>The surrenders were announced by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhWvB3ssP54">Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam in a press conference on Tuesday.</a> She said 400 of the 600 were arrested, and the other 200 were let go because they are under 18.</p>
      <p>A further hard core of 100 protesters remain at the campus, she said.</p>

      <p>“If they can leave the campus in a peaceful way, the police will not use violence,” Lam said. Authorities have been clear in their desire to prosecute those</p>
      <p>Many people attempted to escape the university campus earlier in the stand-off, using inventive methods in an attempt to avoid arrest.</p>
      <p>On Monday night, a group of people trapped in the university abseiled down a footbridge down to getaway vehicles, <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3038365/hong-kong-protests-police-siege-polytechnic-university">according to the South China Morning Post</a>.</p>

      <p>Over the weekend a violent stand-off between protesters and the police took place, as police fired tear gas and water cannons filled with a dye that irritates the skin at the protesters, according to <a href="https://www.insider.com/photos-videos-protests-hong-kong-polytechnic-university-tear-gas-arrows-2019-11">an earlier report</a> from Business Insider.</p>
      <p>The protesters gathered makeshift <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/hong-kong-protesters-making-home-made-weapons-as-protests-escalate-2019-11?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T">weapons such as javelins and bows and arrows</a>, thought to have been taken from the athletic department of the university.</p>
      <p>On Monday the police <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HongKongPoliceForce/videos/439153846801897/?__xts__[0]=68.ARA_FyzusnGIZ9lhd0_7FQa2KdvEZqjacWbEYfanKZb087vLXVR-KdBQJeDRLeJGWy5gQwDEzryZmOu8VP_ML0QZTsEBnwOy0gRyZxZTD0GAqs3tF4uYC8roXGhAZozwbjuxEA6hvn0C2rjLqmRQPd4aIugPqQv7I-fG4hEqUsjm1sTJHkEcLx_2RxUxRbjVL6Ey9CVnHH1hVa0hnr3tlT40Hwmw9TfspAykBu35pUaVL90O8R0tHyQelz9Zmw32CcdOj8hBr4jNiRRwgw7lzPTK9C43jcL0hWVfrJYrwE8e9sK1mCw9c_6a_fZDuHuRxAPKbvC4yfUWSkhP47667-KhJVm4My0zRhg&amp;amp;__tn__=-R">threatened to use live rounds</a> if protesters did not “stop assaulting the police using cars, gas bombs and bows and arrows,” according to an <a href="https://www.insider.com/photos-videos-protests-hong-kong-polytechnic-university-tear-gas-arrows-2019-11">earlier report from Business Insider.</a></p>
      <p>Demonstrations in the semi-autonomous Chinese city erupted in June over a proposed extradition bill, but have <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-going-on-in-hong-kong-china-protests-nba-apple">since evolved to include demands for greater democratic freedoms</a>.</p>
