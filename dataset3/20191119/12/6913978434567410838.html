      <p><b>COLOMBO -</b> The unfinished, purple-headed Lotus Tower soars uselessly into the Colombo sky, mired in corruption allegations -- a project typical of China's misadventures in Sri Lanka under a political dynasty that has just returned to power.<br/><br/>With the Rajapaksas clan now back, Beijing will likely be too, experts say.<br/><br/>On Monday Gotabaya Rajapaksa was sworn in as president, almost five years after his brother Mahinda's decade in charge ended in ignominy in 2015 as allegations of corruption and nepotism surfaced.<br/><br/>Under Mahinda, who may become prime minister, Sri Lanka secured almost $7 billion in loans from China, dislodging Japan as Sri Lanka's main funder of infrastructure.<br/><br/>But many of the projects have proven to be white elephants, including a $210-million airport that has no commercial flights.<br/><br/>In 2016 troops had to shoo away deer, wild buffalo and elephants from the site.<br/><br/>China also financed a 35,000-seat cricket stadium which seldom hosts matches, a performing arts center in Colombo with few shows and a misfiring power plant.<br/><br/>Some of the money was allocated under Beijing's gargantuan Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) spanning Asia and beyond and aimed at facilitating trade.<br/><br/>Western countries worry that the BRI conceals China's efforts to expand its influence by loaning nations money only to acquire the assets when they cannot repay.<br/><br/>Hambantota port in southern Sri Lanka, situated on a key maritime trading route between Europe and Asia, is for critics a prime example.<br/><br/>In December 2017, Sri Lanka was forced to hand the port over to China on a 99-year lease after failing to service a $1.4-billion debt from Beijing to build it.<br/><br/>For the Rajapaksas, who together spearheaded the brutal crushing of Tamil separatists in 2009 -- with allegedly 40,000 civilians killed -- China also came in handy in other ways.<br/><br/>"What the Chinese offered to a regime that was being chastised for its human rights record... was international diplomatic protection as well the funds for development," analyst Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu told AFP.<br/><br/>China meanwhile got a potential strategic toehold, right in India's backyard. In 2014, two Chinese submarines docked at Colombo.<br/><br/>Many of the building projects, like the 350-metre Lotus Tower, have been accused of facilitating corruption.<br/><br/>One of the two Chinese companies building the huge flower-shaped structure vanished with an advance of two billion rupees ($18 million), according to outgoing president Maithripala Sirisena.<br/><br/>Reputedly South Asia's tallest free-standing communications tower, it is set to be opened soon -- but just for people to enjoy the view, since it's not functioning yet.<br/><br/>The Rajapaksas say they had to borrow from China because credit was hard to come by elsewhere, and Akhil Bery from think-tank Eurasia said that there is some truth to this.<br/><br/>Nor was it "all bad", Bery told AFP, with the Chinese-funded Colombo International Container Terminal "already profitable". -AFP</p>
