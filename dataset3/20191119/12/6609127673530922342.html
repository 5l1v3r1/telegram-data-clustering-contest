      <p>Lisbon Lions legend McNeill died in April this year.</p>
      <p>He passed away just two years after his family revealed he was battling dementia.</p>
      <p>The Hoops icon was the first British player to lift the European Cup and the club's greatest captain.</p>
      <p>Hoops supporters were quick to salute Harrison's painting as they responded to the boxer.</p>
