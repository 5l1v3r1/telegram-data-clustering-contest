      <p>Jeffree Star is going all out for his 34th birthday celebrations, jetting off to Bora Bora for some hardcore self-care.</p>
      <p>Why not?</p>
      <p>The YouTube star, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/01/inside-shane-dawson-and-jeffree-stars-controversies-from-blackface-to-james-charles-feud-10819032/">who has previously been embroiled in controversies</a>, shared a snap of himself lazing in a hammock, with a stunning tropical backdrop.</p>
      <p>‘Hi #BoraBora How Are Ya?,’ he wrote. ‘Just landed in paradise to celebrate my birthday all week and I’m so happy to be back to my favorite place on the planet.’</p>

      <p>Unable to resist a bit of a plug, he added: ‘PS. The next episode aka the finale of my series w @shanedawson will be out this week!’</p>
      <p>However, not everything has been smooth sailing, with the star revealing on Twitter he’d had a bit of an unconventional mishap.</p>

      <p>Thankfully, he managed to sort the situation pretty quickly, tweeting: ‘Nail Update: They had one bottle of superglue on the entire island, let’s pray it holds.’</p>
      <p>The drama of it all.</p>
      <p>Sharing other snaps from his idyllic holiday, the beauty guru enjoyed a huge breakfast, before showing his boyfriend Nate Schwandt going for a dip in the sea with a flamingo inflatable and giving us major travel envy.</p>
      <p>Ah, the life of a YouTube millionaire.</p>

      <p>The snaps come after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/jeffree-star-extra-34th-birthday-celebrates-shane-dawson-11167515/">Jeffree celebrated his birthday at home with his best pal Shane Dawson</a>, decorating his home with bright pink decorations, including a huge pink marijuana leaf that took pride of place.</p>
      <p>However, the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/shane-dawson-accused-copping-shortening-jeffree-star-series-removing-james-charles-drama-11089804/">YouTube besties recently faced some backlash over their series</a>, with some fans branding it ‘nothing more than a huge promotion’ for Shane’s new eyeshadow palette.</p>

      <p>Shane revealed there will be just one more episode from the project, saying: ‘Working on the last epsiode of the jeffree series now. i don’t wanna give a day cause i don’t wanna disappoint anyone if it’s not ready in time but just know me and andrew are working our hardest to make it good and to end it right.’</p>
      <p>While it’s not clear what exactly the final episode will show, the original plan was for a nine-episode series <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/25/shane-dawson-breaks-james-charles-drama-controversial-jeffree-star-trailer-10803689/">and the trailer showed a lot more than we’ve currently seen</a> (including Shane’s reaction to the James Charles and Tati Westbrook drama).</p>

      <p>While some were still optimistic, another fan told him: ‘Hopefully this is a lesson to not give an episode count when the series hasn’t been edited yet. Happy we’re getting another one but 9 were promised,’ one fan told him.</p>
      <p>‘This felt like it was nothing more than a huge promotion for your palette,’ another added.</p>
