      <h2>After qualifying for the Euros they have let the Madrid man go</h2>

      <p>Luka Modric returns to Real Madrid action after beating Slovakia 3-1 and booking Croatia's ticket to Euro 2020. His national team have let him go ahead of the friendly against Georgia on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The player returned from international duty twice in a row and has spent 23 days out so this time he will be allowed to come back early before that can happen again.</p>
      <p>Modric has played just nine games this season, with Fede Valverde stepping up to impress in midfield.</p>
      <p>Modric will return to Madrid training on Monday ahead of the weekend clash with Real Sociedad.</p>
