      <p>India captain Virat Kohli has taken fitness to an all-new level and his recent video on Instagram is a testament of that. Kohli posted a video on his social media handle where he was working on his abs on a chin-up bar and in the process fans got a look of his eight-pack abs. Impressed by it, Australian cricketer <a href="https://www.india.com/topic/David-Warner">David Warner</a> reacted on the video. He commented on the post and wrote, <i>“Oh, I love this man ABS ABS”.</i></p>
      <p>Kohli had earlier posted the video and captioned it as, “No Days Off.”</p>

      <p>In the past, Kohli has posted videos of doing deadlifts, and keeping up with the trend, the Indian captain, posted a new workout video where he was performing an exercise for the lower abdomen. The most striking feature of it, however, is Kohli’s chiselled eight-pack-abs that simply cannot escape the eyes. Yes, not six… eight.</p>
      <p>Kohli’s love for fitness and undergoing a physical transformation is well known. During an interview, Kohli had revealed how in 2012 after a poor IPL season, he decided to change for the better. He looked at himself in the mirror and said to himself “this is not what a cricketer is supposed to look like. His training was horrible and Kohli used to eat bad, have the occasional drink and used to be awake till late.</p>
      <p>Kohli would be leading India in its first pink-ball D/N Test against Bangladesh on November 22 at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata. India has already taken a 1-0 lead in the two-match series. India beat Bangladesh by an innings and 130 runs at Indore. Mayank Agarwal was the player of the match, thanks to a double hundred in the first innings.</p>
