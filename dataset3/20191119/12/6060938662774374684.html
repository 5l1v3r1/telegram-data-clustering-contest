      <p>LAHORE: Sixteen-year-old <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Naseem-Shah">Naseem Shah</a> has been in the limelight for his skills and is likely to make his debut in the first Test against Australia at Brisbane.</p>
      <p>He impressed everyone with his ability to move the ball at a brisk clip owing to which he is generating tremendous interest ahead of the series. Talking about him, former bowling great <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Shoaib-Akhtar">Shoaib Akhtar</a> lauded Naseem and compared his temperament to Indian skipper <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Virat-Kohli">Virat Kohli</a>.</p>
      <p>"As a bowler I can say that Pakistan have found a solid [Tagda] fast bowler," Akhtar said on his YouTube channel.</p>
      <p>"What I really like about Naseem Shah is that he understands how to bowl. To know how to bowl at this young age is amazing and it is inbuilt in some - this is same as <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/mohammad-amir">Mohammad Amir</a> when he come on to the scene in 2009," he added.</p>
      <p>"I want to see a fast bowler who has a strong character and I know that every fast bowler gets hit about in Australia but when you fight it out, you are also appreciated there," Akhtar exressed.</p>
      <p>Akhtar said that it will be interesting to see how the young man reacts under pressure.</p>
      <p>"We have to wait and then see how he responds when he is put under pressure, but I really wish him the best of luck. He has already shown a lot of courage by staying back despite the demise of his mother," he said.</p>
