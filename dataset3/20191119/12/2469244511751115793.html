      <p>A brave Devon mum has come face-to-face with the man found guilty of causing a fatal crash which killed her teenage son.</p>
      <p>Will Ure, a 17-tear-old apprentice carpenter, tragically died, when the Honda Civic he was a passenger in came off the A3052 in east Devon in the early hours of December 17, 2016.</p>
      <p>The driver, his friend Richard Weldon, 28, escaped with serious injuries.</p>
      <p>Following Will's death, it emerged Richard had smoked cannabis earlier and was probably driving too quickly. Last year he was given a suspended sentence at Exeter Crown Court after he admitted causing death by careless driving.</p>

      <p>The court heard that if he had been paying attention the crash could have been avoided.</p>
      <p>Will's mum Jane, from Uplyme, recalled: “I was away visiting family when my husband phoned to tell me the news that Will had died in a car crash.</p>
      <p>"That was the moment that my world shattered."</p>
      <p>Paying tribute to Will she described him as sensitive, kind hearted and sociable boy who had a wide group of friends.</p>
      <p>To help deal with her loss and grief, Jane was offered the chance to take part in restorative justice - a scheme that enables communication between victim and the person that committed the crime against them.</p>
      <p>Now, as part of Restorative Justice Awareness Week, she has spoken about the process and how it helped her to deal with feelings of anger she had following her son’s death.</p>

      <p>In Devon, Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly restorative justice is delivered by Make Amends, a service commissioned by Police and Crime Commissioner Alison Hernandez.</p>
      <p>Both Jane and Richard decided to take part in the scheme.</p>
      <p>Jane, who says it has helped her, said: “The restorative justice team became involved because my police liaison officer had told me about the service and when the criminal proceedings had finished I felt the need to find out more.</p>
      <p>“The Make Amends team came to visit me at my home on a number of occasions and they guided me through the whole process.</p>
      <p>“They helped me to understand my needs, managed my expectations and explored the impact of the harm. I wanted to meet the driver and they helped prepare me for a face-to-face meeting.”</p>

      <p>It is a service that she hopes more victims of crime will consider exploring.</p>
      <p>“It gives you a voice, it gives you the opportunity to express how you feel, to let the person who’s caused harm understand the consequences of their actions so hopefully they do not repeat that behaviour and harm others,” she added.</p>
      <p>“Personally meeting the driver also helped me to learn more about the impact of what had happened to him and to gain insight about him as a person.</p>
      <p>“To hear his heartfelt apology has helped me in some part to deal with the anger that I have been carrying with me about what happened to my son.”</p>
      <p>Restorative justice is available to victims of a range of crimes.</p>
      <p>Make Amends service manager Dr Davina Cull said: "What is clear when we do restorative work, is how brave and courageous people are when they volunteer to undertake this type of communication. In sharing a space together, the dialogue helps both people understand each other's experiences and enables questions to be answered.</p>
      <p>"Of course it can be challenging, but it can also be incredibly transformative for them both.”</p>
