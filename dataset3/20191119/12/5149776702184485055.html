      <h1>Nottingham bar Billy Bootleggers ordered by council to remove 'detrimental' signage</h1>
      <h2>They have eight weeks to appeal</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:31:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:31</time> by <a rel="author">Lynette Pinchess</a></address>
      <p>A Nottingham bar has been told to remove a "detrimental" signage outside the building because it's not in keeping with the area.</p>
      <p>Dive bar Billy Bootloggers has received a letter from Nottingham City Council turning down retrospective planning permission for the large-scale painted logo on the property in Weekday Cross, in the Lace Market.</p>
      <p>Planners said: "The unauthorised painted signage is detrimental to the visual amenity of the building and wider Conservation Area by virtue of its scale, location and impact upon the character and appearance of the host building."</p>
      <p>The sign, by a local artist, also covers one of the sash windows.</p>
      <p>The bourbon and live music venue opened its doors at the beginning of October in the building which used to be Filthy's, and for a short time, Chemistry.</p>

      <p>Elliot Towsey, who runs<a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/food-drink/american-inspired-dive-bar-billy-3336663"> Billy Bootleggers</a> with Paul Scevington, said: "I didn't know we had to apply for permission with it being painted and not an erected sign. We didn't foresee it would be a problem.</p>
      <p>"The area has a mixture of buildings and styles and I don't think it's detrimental. I think it's a strange decision when in the surrounding area there are other large painted logos on buildings.</p>
      <p>"We've a couple of ideas. We are not wanting to upset anyone but we are hoping to stand up for ourselves."</p>

      <p>A city council spokesperson said: “This was a retrospective application to retain a sign that had been put up without consent. It was refused because we share the concerns raised by the<a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/student-flats-bid-prominent-city-3400318"> Civic Society</a> and Conservation Officer that the sign spoils the appearance of this prominent and characterful building and the wider conservation area.</p>
      <p>"The sign also masks one of the original sash windows that has been boarded up, which upsets the composition of the building.</p>
      <p>“We will now liaise with the applicant about its removal, which could involve enforcement action if that becomes necessary. If applicants want to appeal they need to do so within eight weeks from the date of the decision.”</p>
