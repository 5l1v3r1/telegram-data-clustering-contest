      <p>The cold coffee and the Nandini ‘kashaya milk’ launched by the Dakshina Kannada Cooperative Milk Producers’ Union Limited (DKMUL) here on November 19 will be available in the market in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi from November 21, according to its president Raviraj Hegde.</p>
      <p>Speaking at a function organised to launch the two products, he said that the samples will be given free to customers in the Nandini milk outlets in the two districts on November 20. Customers can get them till the sample stocks in the outlets last.</p>
      <p>Mr. Hegde said the DKMUL is the first union among 14 cooperative milk unions in the State to launch these two products.</p>
      <p>He said that the cold coffee and the ‘kashaya’ will be sold in 200 ml pet bottles and be priced at ₹25 and ₹20, respectively.</p>
      <p>The ‘kashaya’ has been prepared using sterilised homogenised double-tonned milk, jaggery, turmeric, dry ginger, black pepper, coriander, jeera and other spices. The union is using special instant coffee powder, sugar and sterilised homogenised double-tonned milk to prepare the cold coffee.</p>
      <p>In addition, single Nandini peda of 25 gm pack at ₹10 and Nandini paneer in 500 gm pack were also released on the occasion.</p>
      <p>The new products were released to commemorate the 66th All India Cooperative Week being observed by the union from November 14 to 20.</p>
      <p>Mr. Hegde said the ‘suvasitha’ flavoured milk launched by the union earlier is in great demand now.</p>
      <p>D. Veerendra Heggade, Pattadhikari, Shree Kshetra Dharmasthala, who released the products with others, said that dairying gave daily income to farmers. When floods hit many parts of the State this August, farmers could recover from its damage by selling milk. There is no healthy alternative drink to milk, he said.</p>
      <p>M.N. Rajendra Kumar, president, Dakshina Kannada Central Cooperative Bank, S.R. Satishchandra, president, the Central Arecanut and Cocoa Marketing and Processing Cooperative Ltd., D. Vedavyasa Kamath, MLA, Mangaluru City South, spoke.</p>
