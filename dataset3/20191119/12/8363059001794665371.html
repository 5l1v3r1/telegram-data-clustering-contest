      <p>The Black Friday sales are coming thick and fast, and Oppo joins the fray with big discounts on its mid-range smartphones.</p>
      <p>The star of the show is the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/OPPO-256GB-Storage-6-6-Inch-Smartphone-Green/dp/B07TD978VF?tag=georiot-us-default-20&amp;ascsubtag=trd-1312944922729917306-21">Oppo Reno 10x Zoom</a> that's down from £699 to £459, with a huge £190 discount. Oppo's flagship smartphone launched earlier this year and features the shark fin pop-up camera, a 6.6-inch display, and houses a Snapdragon 855 chipset. Both the black and green models are discounted.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/OPPO-256GB-Storage-6-4-Inch-Smartphone-Green/dp/B07DFCVH82?tag=georiot-us-default-20&amp;ascsubtag=trd-7764017069850757236-21">Reno</a> has gotten a pretty big chunk of its price gouged out too, with a very tempting Black Friday price tag of £279, saving you £120. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/OPPO-128GB-Storage-6-4-Inch-Smartphone-Blue/dp/B07TRTRZMT?tag=georiot-trd-21&amp;ascsubtag=trd-1609726299660467974-21&amp;th=1">Oppo's RX17 Pro</a>, geared towards snapping nighttime photos, is on sale for £249, saving you £100, while the cheaper <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/OPPO-CPH1979-Aurora-Purple-RENO/dp/B07VLYNNMG/ref=sr_1_5?ascsubtag=trd-3876160145932102431-21&amp;keywords=oppo+reno+z+purple&amp;qid=1574161792&amp;smid=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&amp;sr=8-5">Reno Z</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/OPPO-128GB-Storage-6-4-Inch-Smartphone-Blue/dp/B07TPC5HNP?tag=georiot-trd-21&amp;ascsubtag=trd-6767339041730066122-21">RX17 Neo</a> are reduced to £199 (£100 off) and £159 (£66 off) respectively.</p>
      <p>If you're looking to pick up a solid mid-range handset, we'd recommend the Oppo Reno 10x Zoom, but they're are all decent enough little phones, and you really can't beat these prices. All of the deals - with the exception of the RX17 Neo are also available at the <a href="https://www.carphonewarehouse.com/oppo/rx17-pro.html#!colour=blue&amp;capacity=128GB&amp;dealType=sf">Carphone Warehouse</a>.</p>
