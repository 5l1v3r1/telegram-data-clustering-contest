      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:19:32+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/adam-jones/" target="_blank">Adam Jones</a></address>
      <p>Italy's U21 boss Paolo Nicolato has made clear that Everton star Moise Kean has been "perfect" during the current international break.</p>
      <p>The striker has been the subject of speculation this week having started just two Premier League games since his big money move to Goodison Park from Juventus last month.</p>
      <p>The teenager was also dropped for the Blues squad by <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/marco-silva">Marco Silva</a> against Southampton just before the international break having arrived late for a team meeting for the second time.</p>
      <p>Some reports have linked the youngster with a potential reutrn to Italy already, but U21s manager Nicolato has made clear the pressure isn't getting to Kean.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> striker was suspended for his side's 3-0 win over Iceland at the weekend, but has been "perfect" in training according to his manager.</p>
      <p>"At his age it's not easy with this pressure," Nicolato told <a href="https://www.football-italia.net/146597/nicolato-kean-perfect-u21s">Football Italia</a>.</p>
      <p>"He was perfect over the last few days. It is not easy to manage all this interest, this pressure. But within the group he is doing well."</p>
      <p>Kean will be available for selection once more when Italy U21s take on Armenia on Tuesday evening before returning to Merseyside to prepare for Everton's clash with Norwich this weekend.</p>
