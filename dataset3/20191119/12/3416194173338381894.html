      <p><a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/taylor-swift/"><b>Taylor Swift</b></a> has everybody wondering about her upcoming performance!</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old star is reportedly preparing a “fierce show of female artistic strength and empowerment,” sources told <i><a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/11/19/how-taylor-swift-will-fight-back-against-scooter-braun-during-american-music-awards/">Page Six</a></i> on Tuesday (November 19).</p>
      <p>If you didn’t know, <b>Taylor</b> is publicly feuding with <a href="http://www.justjared.com/tags/scooter-braun/"><b>Scooter Braun</b></a> and <a href="http://www.justjared.com/tags/scott-borchetta/"><b>Scott Borchetta</b></a> from her former label Big Machine Records regarding the use of her old songs.</p>
      <p>According to the report, she will “fight back against <b>Braun</b> in both her much-anticipated performance and in a speech,” and could even be joined by close friends including <a href="http://www.justjared.com/tags/selena-gomez/"><b>Selena Gomez</b></a>, <a href="http://www.justjared.com/tags/kesha/"><b>Kesha</b></a> and <a href="http://www.justjared.com/tags/halsey/"><b>Halsey</b></a>.</p>
      <p>“<b>Taylor</b> will turn her <i>AMA</i> performance into a huge moment, and a powerful message. We are expecting to see artists such as <b>Selena</b> join her on stage as part of a fierce show of female artistic strength and empowerment. Then, when accepting her award, <b>Taylor</b> will likely make a statement about artists being able to own their masters, the music they created, and how she feels she has been treated by <b>Scooter</b> and <b>Scott [Borchetta</b>, the founder of <b>Swift</b>’s former label Big Machine],” the source went on to explain.</p>
      <p><b>Taylor</b> has not yet commented on her upcoming performance. There <a href="http://www.justjared.com/2019/11/18/amas-producer-denies-making-joint-statement-with-big-machine/">has been controversy</a> over the last few days after <b>Taylor Swift</b> told fans that Big Machine was blocking her from performing her old music at the <i>AMAs</i> on November 24.</p>
