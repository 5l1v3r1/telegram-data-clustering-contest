      <h1>Perthshire widow overwhelmed by public’s support</h1>
      <h2>Elaine’s husband chose to end his life in September</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:11:09+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:11</time> by <a rel="author">Melanie Bonn, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/melanie-bonn/</a></address>
      <p>The widow of Richard Selley, the Perthshire man who chose to end his life at the Dignitas clinic in September, has been rocked by the wave of support for her husband’s decision.</p>
      <p>Elaine Selley (58) of Glenalmond, has been inundated with messages from people backing the legalisation of euthanasia in Scotland.</p>
      <p>Richard spent his final years campaigning for assisted dying to be introduced in Scotland.</p>
      <p>His widow has spoken out, having received “overwhelming” support since Richard (65), a motor neurone disease (MND) sufferer for four years, cut short his life at the Swiss facility on September 6.</p>
      <p>He administered to himself a powerful dose of sedatives, ending his battle with the disease which has no cure.</p>
      <p>On the day he took the action to put an end to his suffering, Richard issued a plea to MSPs to let people slip away at home.</p>
      <p>In the following days, Elaine praised the staff at the Swiss clinic, but confirmed that having to travel so far from familiar surroundings was an “awful” experience.</p>
      <p>With only herself allowed to go with him, Elaine described the agony of saying a final goodbye to their children in the airport.</p>
      <p>She told a Sunday newspaper: “Having to say goodbye to people you loved at the airport, surrounded by everybody on their way to Spain and Portugal on their holidays - it was awful.”</p>
      <p>Elaine said there was no question though about what Richard wanted: “Some people are quite happy to let nature take its course, but Richard wanted to take charge of his end of life experience, to ensure it was peaceful and he wasn’t in any pain.</p>
      <p>“And I can’t see any opposing argument to that if there are safeguards in place.”</p>
      <p>Since losing her husband, Elaine has pledged her determination to carry on Richard’s battle to change Holyrood legislation so people can die at home surrounded by their loved ones.</p>
      <p>The charity Dignity in Dying hopes to put the issue back on the agenda at the next Holyrood session.</p>
      <p>The Scottish Government has said it “supports greater public and personal discussion of bereavement, death, dying and care at the end of life”.</p>
      <p>Opponents argue legalising assisted dying would expose people to coercion and abuse.</p>
      <p>The Perthshire-based Selleys went ahead and paid £10,000 to travel to the controversial Swiss facility in September, a cost many others could not afford.</p>
      <p>Elaine said: “Richard left a legacy.</p>
      <p>“I had no idea his story captured so many hearts and made people think about this issue to live positively with a terminal illness.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been overwhelmed with letters of support. There’s hundreds from all over the world - from Canada, New Zealand, Dubai, North America and Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>“We’ve also had a great deal of letters supporting assisted dying from complete strangers who hope the law will be changed.</p>
      <p>“What stands out is empathy for the case and the cause, people sharing end-of-life experiences of loved ones who want assisted dying and wish they had that opportunity.</p>
      <p>“I promised I’d carry on what he started. I also want to raise awareness of motor neurone disease.”</p>
