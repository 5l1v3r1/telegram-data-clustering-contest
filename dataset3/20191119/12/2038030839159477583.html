      <p>Cape Town - Is there anything Harry Styles can’t do?</p>
      <p>The <i>Lights Up</i> singer recently sent his fans into a frenzy after taking to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B4-A8kmHNYY/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link"><b>Instagram</b></a> to share snaps of himself dressed as a ballerina.</p>
      <p>In the pics, the 25-year-old is wearing a pink tutu, white tights and executing a series of ballerina poses.</p>
      <p>Harry’s post garnered more than two million likes on the social media platform.</p>
      <p>"I can NOT WAIT to show my 5-year-old son! He likes his nails painted (like his big sister), and a ring his big sister made him out of elastics," one user commented. "He kept asking me if other boys do those things. I told him it doesn’t matter as long as he likes them. But he is persistent... Thank you Harry for being awesome and setting an amazing example!"</p>
      <p>"This is the greatest thing I’ve ever seen," another follower commented.</p>

      <p>"I love those guys; they’re my brothers. Niall, Liam, Louis... and Ringo. Yeah, that’s it."</p>
