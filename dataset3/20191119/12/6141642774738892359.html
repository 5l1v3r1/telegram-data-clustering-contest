      <p>Liberal Democrats leader Jo Swinson has warned the public to be wary of sharing misinformation after a story went viral that claimed she had abused squirrels.</p>
      <p>Doctored images claiming to show an article on the Mirror’s website were shared thousands of times across Twitter and Facebook last week, including by a number of pro-Brexit and Brexit Party groups.</p>
      <p>The false story, written by non-existant journalist “Wurrance Telephene”, claimed the Lib Dem leader was blasted by animal rights charities after “harrowing footage” was found on a private Facebook account.</p>

      <p>“There was one that used Peter Walker’s name from the Guardian and he had to go online to debunk it and say he never wrote it.</p>
      <p>“But they’re quite sophisticated in that people believe them.</p>

      <p>“I think it’s very difficult to prevent the spread.”</p>
      <p>Researchers at First Draft, a non-profit group fighting misinformation, found that the false story was originally circulated among anonymous pro-Labour accounts, confined to a fairly small section of Twitter.</p>

        <figcaption>The story was then republished on to Medium, under a fake profile. (Medium/PA)</figcaption>

      <p>The Medium post has since been removed.</p>
      <p>The post received few interactions until it was shared by a Brexit Party account on November 14 with nearly 9,000 followers.</p>

      <p>It then picked up more than 20,000 interactions across social media.</p>
      <p>Posts promoting the story can still be found across both Twitter and Facebook, despite both social companies vowing to tackle misinformation on their platforms.</p>

        <b>How to spot ‘fake news’</b>
      </p>
      <p>With an increasing number of false news stories circulating online, members of the public need to be wary before sharing anything online.</p>
      <p>First, vet the publisher’s credibility. Is it a legitimate news source, written by a legitimate journalist? If the domain name is something like “.com.co” it is likely the site is illegitimate.</p>
      <p>Pay attention to the quality — are there grammatical errors? Google the story and see if it’s old or recycled.</p>

      <p>If the story is reliant on images, a reverse image search can establish where these came from. If the story is a screengrab of what looks like a legitimate website, find the original version. It’s easy to edit pictures so they look real.</p>
      <p>If in doubt, don’t share the story. Visit a fact-checking website, or see what legitimate news sources are saying before you retweet content.</p>

      <p>Facebook has said it will attempt to crack down on fake content, by flagging it with users. If a story has been debunked, related links will appear next to the original.</p>
