        <li>Josh O’Connor who plays <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/prince-charles">Prince Charles</a> in Netflix’s <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/the-crown">“The Crown”</a> said the future king is “waiting for his mother to die for his life to have meaning.”</li>
        <li>Josh O’Connor is the first actor to play the next in line to the throne as an adult for the third season of the series.</li>
        <li>He told <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/culture/article/josh-o-connor-the-crown-season-3-interview">British GQ</a> that Prince Charles has been living his life “in purgatory.”</li>
        <li>“Waiting for your parent to die is pretty messed up. That the one person who should be unconditional is the person that holds the power for you to have any meaning in your life … it’s quite nice to play that. They’re huge stakes,” he said.</li>
        <li>The 29-year-old prepared for his royal role by eating “a lot of boiled eggs,” like Prince Charles and by taking horse riding lessons to learn his distinct style.</li>

      <p>The 29-year-old, who previously starred in <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/peaky-blinders">“Peaky Blinders”</a> and the 2017 movie “God’s Own Country,” told <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/culture/article/josh-o-connor-the-crown-season-3-interview">British GQ</a> he’d been researching and preparing for the role for months.</p>
      <p>“What I’m gradually finding … is a guy waiting for his mother to die for his life to have meaning. His whole life has been in purgatory,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Waiting for your parent to die is pretty messed up. That the one person who should be unconditional is the person that holds the power for you to have any meaning in your life … it’s quite nice to play that. They’re huge stakes.”</p>
      <p>Prince Charles’ relationship with his mother <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/queen-elizabeth">Queen Elizabeth II</a> is a focal point throughout the third season of the show with the last two seasons focusing on the monarch’s first decade on the throne.</p>
      <p>Season three of the series focuses on the years 1964 to 1976, from when Prince Charles first meets <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/camilla">Camilla</a> to the Queen’s Silver Jubilee.</p>
      <p>And to prepare for such a grand role, O’Connor said he watched the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0br9x0l">BBC documentary, “Prince, Son and Heir: Charles at 70,”</a> and even credits hard-boiled eggs as key to getting into character.</p>
      <p>“I am eating quite a lot of them them because that’s what Charles does. He eats a lot of boiled eggs.”</p>
      <p>The actor who also said he never ridden a horse before “The Crown,” had to learn and perfect Prince Charles’ distinct riding style, particularly in his polo-playing scenes.</p>

      <p>“Charles holds the reins in a different way.</p>
      <p>“Most people have four reins here, then thumb on top. He puts the reins in between each finger. So I learnt that as well. I love that.”</p>
      <p>Season three of the show also sees <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/oscar">Oscar</a>-winner <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/olivia-colman">Olivia Colman</a> star as Queen Elizabeth II and <a href="https://www.insider.com/category/helena-bonham-carter">Helena Bonham Carter</a> as the boisterous Princess Margaret.</p>
