      <p>Nicola, who was understood to be a recovering cancer patient, had fatal head wounds.</p>
      <p>Officers probing her brutal murder think the green household bin could have been lying in the undergrowth for two weeks.</p>
      <p>The grim discovery was made in off Landport Road in Lewes, East Sussex.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Richard Canlin, 41, of no fixed address, was charged with murder on Sunday and appeared at Hove Crown Court on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>He did not enter a plea and will appear again at Crown Court on November 26 for a further hearing.</p>
      <p>A preliminary trial date has been set for April 2020</p>
