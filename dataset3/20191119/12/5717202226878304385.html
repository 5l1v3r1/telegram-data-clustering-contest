      <h1>Report: Newcastle could send Elias Sorensen abroad if Carlisle spell doesn’t work out</h1>
      <h2>Carlisle United now have a new manager.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:15:57+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/jay-williams/" target="_blank">Jay Williams</a></address>
      <p>Newcastle United will judge Elias Sorensen’s progress at Carlisle United and make a decision in January on his immediate future.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/revealed-what-intermediaries-saying-newcastles-17260284">According to a report by The Chronicle</a>, Sorensen has offers from abroad with a number of Danish clubs keen on him. These are likely to be loan moves.</p>
      <p>However, Newcastle want to see how he does at Carlisle in the next six weeks. Sorensen joined Carlisle in the summer but he has barely played for the League Two side.</p>

      <p>Steven Pressley has now been sacked as Carlisle manager and Newcastle hope this could benefit Sorensen. The Magpies will judge how well he is doing under the new boss before deciding whether to leave him at Carlisle or recall him.</p>
      <p>If he is recalled in January, the Denmark U21 starlet could be sent out again. Shola Ameobi, who is in charge of Newcastle’s loan players, has a decision to make but he might be sent back to Denmark on a temporary basis.</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view</h3>
      <p>Sorensen has proven his goalscoring prowess at youth level but now needs to take the plunge into senior football. After his disappointing loan spell at Blackpool last year, it has been more pain for the 20-year-old at Carlisle.</p>
      <p>At this stage of his career, Sorensen cannot afford to be sitting on the bench. He needs regular playing time to show he’s a future Newcastle first-teamer. This is why Ameobi needs to make a wise decision in January.</p>
