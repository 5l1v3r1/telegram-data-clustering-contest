      <h3>Latest Dragon Age 4 tease almost guarantees an imminent reveal</h3>
      <p>Happy Birthday Inquisitor!</p>

      <p>BioWare really knows how to keep us balancing on a knife edge when it comes to <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/dragon-age-4-release-date-news-and-rumors">Dragon Age 4</a> – but it looks like an official reveal is closer than ever.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month the developer announced that, to celebrate the series' 10th anniversary, a celebration event will be taking place on December 4 – aka Dragon 4ge Day – leading fans to hope that an official Dragon Age 4 reveal could be part of the celebrations.</p>
      <p>And a new tease by BioWare has only added fuel to the fire, essentially guaranteeing that a reveal is imminent.</p>

      <h4>Time for tea?</h4>
      <p>BioWare's latest tease comes in the form of a tweet to celebrate the fifth anniversary of Dragon Age: Inquisition. The tweet shows a letter from Dragon Age's Solas to the Inquisitor, suggesting "Tea Soon?".</p>
      <p>Check it out below:</p>

      <p>It doesn't seem like much but we know from Dragon Age 4's teaser trailer that Solas plays a big role in Dragon Age 4 – the Elf may even be the main antagonist. </p>
      <p>This tweet definitely seems to be teasing something. Either that or BioWare loves to make us suffer.</p>
      <p>We're hoping BioWare will shed some light on the game soon – particularly as there have been rumors it will follow in Anthem's footsteps and be a live service title. It seems all will be officially revealed on December 4.</p>
