      <p>From Bon Appétit's November 2019 issue, a Thanksgiving recipe from Molly Baz and Carla Lalli Music:</p>
      <p>"A make-ahead gravy that doesn't rely on turkey drippings or a roux. The gravy's depth of flavor comes from roasted poultry bones and – surprise! – a sprinkle of MSG, which has an umami-to-the-max effect. (Despite exaggerated fearmongering reports in the '70s, MSG is harmless in such small quantities; <a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/story/give-msg-a-chance">read more here</a>.) </p>
      <p>"If you have the backbone from breaking down the turkey into pieces, use it in tandem with the wings."</p>
      <h3>Why-Is-It-So-Good Gravy</h3>
      <p>Recipe by Molly Baz and Carla Lalli Music <br/>Makes 8–10 servings</p>
      <p>
        <i>Ingredients:</i>
      </p>
      <p>3 lb. turkey and/or chicken wings, flats and drumettes separated<br/>4 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided<br/>2 heads of garlic, cut in half crosswise<br/>2 large shallots, unpeeled, halved<br/>1 4" piece ginger, scrubbed, thickly sliced<br/>4 oz. crimini, shiitake, or white button mushrooms, torn into large pieces<br/>2 tsp. black peppercorns, lightly crushed<br/>6 Tbsp. all-purpose flour<br/>4 Tbsp. unsalted butter, room temperature<br/>½ cup amontillado sherry<br/>Handful of parsley or parsley stems<br/>6 cups turkey stock or low-sodium chicken broth, warmed<br/>2 tsp. sherry vinegar or red wine vinegar<br/>1 tsp. MSG<br/>Kosher salt, freshly ground pepper (optional)</p>
      <p>
        <i>Preparation:</i>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Preheat oven to 450°. Toss wings in a large cast-iron skillet with 2 Tbsp. oil until coated. Roast, tossing halfway through, until golden brown and starting to crisp, 25–35 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove wings from oven and add garlic, shallots, ginger, mushrooms, peppercorns, and remaining 2 Tbsp. oil to pan; toss to coat. Return to oven and roast, tossing halfway through, until wings are deeply browned and crisp and vegetables are browned, 30–40 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, mash together flour and butter in a small bowl with your fingers or a fork until homogenous. Set beurre manié aside.</li>
        <li>Remove skillet from oven and set on stovetop over medium-high heat. Add sherry and cook, stirring and scraping up any browned bits with a wooden spoon, until sherry is almost completely reduced, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Scrape wings and aromatics into a medium pot and add parsley and stock. Bring to a low simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce heat and simmer gently, skimming fat from surface occasionally and turning wings so both sides get a chance to be submerged, until liquid is flavorful, mahogany in color, and reduced by about one-third, 30–40 minutes.</li>
        <li>Fish out wings; discard. Pour mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a large measuring glass; discard solids. Rinse out pot and pour turkey mixture back in. Bring to a simmer over medium. Whisking constantly, add reserved beurre manié and whisk until completely incorporated. Simmer, whisking often and skimming any foam from surface, until gravy is thick enough to coat a spoon, 6–8 minutes. Remove from heat and whisk in vinegar and MSG. Taste gravy and season with salt and pepper if desired.</li>
        <li><b>Do Ahead:</b> Gravy (without vinegar and MSG) can be made 5 days ahead. Let cool, then cover and chill. Reheat over medium until simmering, then add vinegar and MSG.</li>
      </ul>
