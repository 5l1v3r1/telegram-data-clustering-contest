      <h2>The Express &amp; Star’s Feed a Family campaign has grown from strength to strength since it was launched in 2016.</h2>

      <p>Last year, our incredible readers donated more that 16,000 items for food banks, the homeless and children at The Haven refuge.</p>
      <p>The campaign really does appear to have brought the very best out in people, and we are hoping to replicate last year’s fantastic response again this Christmas.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>Until December 14, we will be collecting contributions of non-perishable food and toiletries to pass on to good causes over the festive period.</p>
      <p>Christmas is a wonderful time of year, but for many people across our great region it can be a real struggle.</p>
      <p>It is a national tragedy that the number of people attending food banks is at record levels.</p>
      <p>The Trussell Trust, which runs two-thirds of the UK’s food banks, said it distributed a record 823,145 food parcels between April and September, including 301,653 that went to children.</p>
      <p>Across the country it is estimated that at least three million food parcels were given out in 2018-19.</p>
      <p>Unlike some areas of the country, parts of the West Midlands have not benefited from a boosted economy. Unemployment has stayed high.</p>
      <p>That is why we are once again calling on our readers for their help to make the festive season special for those who are struggling to make ends meet.</p>
      <p>To date, even though the campaign is still in its early stages, we have already had some fantastic pledges of support.</p>
      <p>These include 1,500 items from Lichfield food bank, as well as a number of other generous donations which will be revealed in the E&amp;S over the course of the week.</p>
      <p>But the success of the campaign is reliant on the involvement of people from across the region.</p>
      <p>Donations can include Christmas items, such as mince pies or Christmas cakes; cupboard essentials such as tinned food and rice; and toiletries.</p>
      <p>All donations are gratefully received and will be delivered by the E&amp;S to worthy causes including the Black Country Foodbank, The Well, The Good Shepherd and The Haven.</p>
