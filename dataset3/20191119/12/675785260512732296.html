      <p>During Monday's jungle installment, Adele shared her luxury item - albeit an unusual choice - was a picture of Loose Woman Jane.</p>
      <p>Adele's partner Kate was fawning over Jane saying everyone was hoping she would be sent into the jungle when she appeared on BBC 1 Breakfast with Greg Jones on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Kate said: "We're keeping our fingers crossed for Jane [going in] . She [Adele] won't [come back]. I'll be voting for Jane.</p>
      <p>"She's got [book] Riding the waves by Jane McDonald [in lockdown]. It's just been released.</p>

      <p>Kate wrote back: "Oh Jane, she will ADOOOOOORE this! Thank you so much."</p>
