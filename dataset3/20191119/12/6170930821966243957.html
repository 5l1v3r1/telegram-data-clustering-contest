      <h1>No evidence for Trump's claim that Pelosi, Schiff promised to impeach him before he took office</h1>

      <blockquote>"Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff, and the rest of the corrupt Democrats made a promise to their crazy left-wing base that they would impeach me even BEFORE I took office."<br/><pic src="https://static.politifact.com/rulings/tom-false.png" width="100"/><cite>— <a href="https://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a> on Thursday, November 14th, 2019 in a Facebook ad</cite></blockquote>
      <p>In a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&amp;ad_type=all&amp;country=US&amp;impression_search_field=has_impressions_lifetime&amp;id=1481396508680559&amp;view_all_page_id=153080620724">Facebook ad</a> that started running Nov. 14, the day after the <a href="https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2019/nov/13/fact-checking-house-impeachment-hearings-trump/">first</a> public hearing of the impeachment inquiry, President <a href="https://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a> declared:</p>
      <p>"Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff, and the rest of the corrupt Democrats made a promise to their crazy left-wing base that they would impeach me even BEFORE I took office."</p>
      <p>Did the two California House members — <a href="https://www.politifact.com/personalities/nancy-pelosi/">Speaker Pelosi</a> and impeachment inquiry leader <a href="https://www.politifact.com/personalities/adam-schiff/">Schiff</a> — and other Democrats pledge to impeach Trump even before his inauguration on Jan. 20, 2017?</p>
      <p>We found no evidence of it.</p>
      <p>In fact, Pelosi and Schiff long resisted calls by other Democrats for the current impeachment inquiry.</p>
      <h3>Talk, but no promises</h3>
      <p>There was some early talk about possible impeachment.</p>
      <p>In April 2016 — before Trump even won the GOP nomination — Politico <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/could-donald-trump-be-impeached-shortly-after-he-takes-office-us-presidential-election-2016-american-president-impeachment/">reported</a> that there was talk of impeaching Trump soon after he took office, were he to be nominated for the presidency and win. Then-U.S. Rep. <a href="https://www.politifact.com/personalities/alan-grayson/">Alan Grayson</a>, D-Fla., said at the time that if Trump insisted on building a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border despite Congress’s opposition, his actions could lead down a path toward impeachment.</p>
      <p>In December 2016, five Democratic senators, including 2020 presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren, <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/12/democrats-pave-the-way-to-impeach-donald-trump">announced</a> they would introduce a bill to require Trump to divest assets that could pose a conflict of interest in his role as president. They said the legislation would symbolically make violations of federal conflict-of-interest rules "a high crime or misdemeanor under the impeachment clause of the U.S. Constitution."</p>
      <p>But those are only examples of Democrats raising the possibility of impeachment — far short of promising to do it. And Pelosi and Schiff were not involved.</p>
      <h3>Trump’s evidence</h3>
      <p>The same is true of two statements cited to us by the Republican National Committee to back Trump’s claim in the ad.</p>
      <p>(The ad, by the way, was placed by the Trump Make America Great Again <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/committee/C00618371/">Committee</a>, a <a href="https://www.pri.org/stories/2019-02-18/donald-trump-created-permanent-presidential-campaign-here-s-how">joint</a> fundraising committee composed of the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee. As of Sept. 30, 2019, it had raised more than $96 million during 2019, according to the latest <a href="https://www.fec.gov/data/committee/C00618371/">figures</a> from the Federal Election Commission.)</p>
      <p><b>1. </b>A Schiff <a href="https://twitter.com/RepAdamSchiff/status/811964588367417345?s=20">tweet</a> on Dec. 22, 2016, said: "There’s no question the Emoluments Clause applies to POTUS – including Trump. Severe remedies if its violated, including impeachment."</p>
      <p>The Constitution’s emoluments <a href="https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2019/oct/21/fact-checking-trump-phony-emoluments-adam-schiff-a/">clause</a> bars officials from receiving payments from foreign entities and is the basis for lawsuits challenging foreign payments to Trump’s Washington hotel. It has rarely been tested in court.</p>
      <p>At the time, the federal Office of Government Ethics was <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trumps-pledge-to-leave-his-business-prompts-calls-to-divest/2016/11/30/e5a12658-b746-11e6-b8df-600bd9d38a02_story.html">urging</a> Trump to sell his business holdings as the "only way to resolve these conflicts of interest." Similarly, Schiff was <a href="https://twitter.com/RepAdamSchiff/status/811964588367417345?s=20">calling</a> on the president-elect to "divest completely," raising impeachment as one possible consequence if Trump didn’t, but not pledging to impeach.</p>
      <p><b>2.</b> U.S. Rep. <a href="https://www.politifact.com/personalities/maxine-waters/">Maxine Waters</a>, another California Democrat, <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2017/01/16/maxine_waters_if_there_was_collusion_with_russia_trump_committed_impeachable_offense.html">said</a> four days before the inauguration that if there was evidence the Trump campaign colluded with the Russians by using hacked information from Democratic National Committee emails against <a href="https://www.politifact.com/personalities/hillary-clinton/">Hillary Clinton</a> in the 2016 election, it would be an impeachable offense. Waters has repeatedly called for Trump’s impeachment, but those demands didn’t <a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/maxine-waters-impeachment-interview">start until the months after Trump took office</a>.</p>
      <p>The RNC didn’t provide us any information about Pelosi. A Pelosi spokesman denied to us that Pelosi ever promised before Trump took office that she would seek to impeach him.</p>
      <p>It’s also important to note that Pelosi and Schiff long <a href="https://apnews.com/7f67e84167d9494ebf465bf9cbacc52e">resisted</a> calls by other Democrats to initiate an impeachment inquiry. Pelosi <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/us/politics/democrats-impeachment-trump.html">launched</a> the inquiry, in September 2019, only after evidence emerged Trump allegedly pressured the president of Ukraine to open a corruption investigation of former Vice President <a href="https://www.politifact.com/personalities/joe-biden/">Joe Biden</a>, a leading contender for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, and his son.</p>
      <h3>Our ruling</h3>
      <p>Trump said, "Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff, and the rest of the corrupt Democrats made a promise to their crazy left-wing base that they would impeach me even BEFORE I took office."</p>
      <p>The Republican National Committee, on Trump’s behalf, cited no evidence of such promises and we did not find any.</p>
      <p>We rate Trump’s statement False.</p>
