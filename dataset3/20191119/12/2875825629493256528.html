      <h1>Pamela Anderson cancels Julian Assange prison visit due to 'personal emergency'</h1>
      <h2>The Baywatch star has repeatedly expressed concern over the WikiLeaks founder's 'declining state' as he languishes in London's Belmarsh Prison</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:32:56+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:32</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Baywatch star turned activist <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/pamela-anderson">Pamela Anderson</a> has cancelled her upcoming visit to Julian Assange in Belmarsh Prison.</p>
      <p>Her Don't Extradite Assange campaign issued a statement that said Pamela- who's best known for playing fan favourite CJ on Baywatch- would have to cancel the visit as she was faced with a "personal emergency."</p>
      <p>It read: "Pamela has a personal emergency which has meant she has had to go home and cancel everything for the next two weeks."</p>
      <p>Assange is known as the founder of WikiLeaks.</p>
      <p>He faces extradition to America and 18 charges there - these include allegations that he conspired to hack into a computer in the US military HQ, The Pentagon.</p>

      <p>Assange was jailed in the UK for 50 weeks after he broke his bail conditions by going into hiding. This came after he'd spent seven years in the London Ecuadorian Embassy to avoid extradition.</p>
      <p>He went into hiding to escape extradition to Sweden, where he faces sex offence alleagations.</p>
      <p>Pamela is one of Assange's most passionate supporters, and has decried the "traumatic psychological torture" she claimed he has faced.</p>
      <p>The 52 year old has also been forthright in urging Assange's native Australia to not let him be sent to the US.</p>
      <p>It wouldn't have been the first time she saw him behind bars, as she met with him earlier this year, saying she was "extremely distressed at the thought of his declining state."</p>

      <p>She also tweeted that he was "hanging on like a superhero".</p>
      <p>It's not the first cause the Canadian-American actress has thrown her weight behind and poured her heart into - she once said "activism is sexy" after all.</p>
      <p>In the 90s, she became associated with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), and in 2003 she became the face of their controversial "I'd Rather Go Naked Than Wear Fur" campaign.</p>
      <p>More recently, she's been a vocal supporter of French protesters, who initially took to the streets at a proposed fuel tax increase.</p>
      <p>She added a new activist credential to her name when she tweeted: "I despise violence...but what is the violence of all these people and burned luxurious cars, compared to the structural violence of the French - and global - elites?"</p>
