      <h1>'Happy, now it's time' - Arsenal fans delighted after Luis Enrique makes Spain decision</h1>
      <h2>Luis Enrique has rejoined Spain as head coach</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:13:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:13</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Ha</a></address>
      <p>Luis Enrique has been confirmed as the new Spain coach ahead of Euro 2020, after making a surprise return to the role.</p>
      <p>Enrique stepped down in June to take care of his daughter Xana, who passed away in September, and Robert Moreno was handed the job.</p>
      <p>But ahead of the European Championship next summer, Spain have moved to bring back the former Barcelona coach after a five-month absence.</p>
      <p>Speaking at a press conference, RFEF president Luis Rubiales said: "Today we can confirm that Luis Enrique is returning to his job.</p>
      <p>"It was clear that in the moment that Luis Enrique felt strong to return, the door was always open for him. I have always said that, and have always been honest, nobody can feel tricked.</p>
      <p>"We want to thank Robert Moreno for his work, he did very well, and we are very happy with what he did. But I repeat that Robert Moreno told us he'd spoken with Luis Enrique, who had told him he wanted to return. We found out through Moreno that Enrique wanted back.</p>
      <p>"We knew Luis Enrique wanted to return but Molina and I decided not to say anything until after qualification phase was done."</p>
      <p>Enrique had been linked with the Arsenal job, with reports claiming the Spaniard was a potential contender to replace Unai Emery, should the Gunners head coach lose his job.</p>
      <p>It was reported that Arsenal head of football Raul Sanllehi had previously sounded out Enrique, with the former Barca boss originally wanted to replace Arsene Wenger in 2018.</p>
      <p>However, some Arsenal fans took to social media after the announcement, with many pleased that Enrique would not be appointed at the Emirates.</p>
