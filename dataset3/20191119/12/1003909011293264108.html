      <h1>Breakenridge: Is Kenney a salesman or a doomsayer for Alberta's economy?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:00:49+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">Rob Breakenridge, for the Calgary Herald</a></address>
      <p>While there has been some consternation recently regarding certain travel expenses incurred by the UPC government, few would begrudge the premier a trade mission to Texas.</p>
      <p>Premier Jason Kenney is in Houston today and tomorrow, meeting with business leaders and investors. He’ll wrap up his trip Thursday with similar meetings in Dallas. According to the premier’s office, Kenney will use the opportunity to “highlight how the province has laid the foundation as a more competitive place for energy sector investments.”</p>
      <p>Regardless of one’s opinion on how Kenney’s government has gone about laying that foundation, we should all hope this trip bears fruit. Despite recent and current challenges, there’s still a good story to be told about our province.</p>
      <p>Or is there? These days, it depends on which hat the premier is wearing and his intended audience. There is at times a conflict between Kenney the premier and Kenney the conservative partisan, and he should be careful to make sure the former isn’t undermining the latter.</p>
      <p>After all, a message of “come invest in Alberta” is hard to reconcile with a message of “Alberta is at the mercy of a malevolent prime minister hell-bent on destroying the province’s energy sector.”</p>
      <p>Kenney hasn’t quite used those exact words, but at times he hasn’t been far off. Following Encana’s decision to rebrand itself and shift its headquarters to the U.S., for example, Kenney said in an interview that he believed the “broader decline of the Canadian energy industry (…) is a deliberate policy of the Trudeau government.”</p>
      <p>Not that Ottawa has been oblivious to the unintended consequences of some poorly conceived policies. Not that Ottawa has failed to make competitiveness a priority. No, the suggestion here is that the federal government is purposely sabotaging the entire industry.</p>
      <p>There are probably many Albertans who believe that or suspect it might be true. If Kenney is then the man to stand up to that federal government, then it helps his political fortunes. It’s also the sort of rhetoric that might have played a part in convincing so many Albertans to vote Conservative in the recent federal election.</p>
      <p>And to be sure, over-the-top rhetoric is not limited to any one party. Both Rachel Notley and Justin Trudeau were guilty of making some sweeping and unfair generalizations of their respective conservative opponents.</p>
      <p>But it’s short-sighted. There’s no provincial election until 2023 and there’s probably not going to be a federal election for at least a couple of years. Perhaps we could dial back the talking-down-the-economy and see how focusing on the positives works out for us.</p>
      <p>Kenney’s plans to tout his competitiveness agenda obviously implies that he’s not powerless when it comes to making positive changes. It’s convenient, I suppose, to blame Ottawa for the bad stuff and take credit for the good stuff. That’s politics. But too much of the blaming might end up making it harder to find those wins.</p>
      <p>That’s not to give Ottawa a pass, obviously. C-48 and C-69 were both ill-conceived pieces of legislation. But C-48 (the tanker ban) doesn’t apply to natural gas, nor does it have any bearing on TMX or Keystone XL. The Senate made numerous changes to C-69 and Trudeau seemed to imply last week that he might consider more changes.</p>
      <p>It’s also unfair to pin all of our problems on Ottawa. Kenney may learn more during his visit to Texas, for example, about the nearly <a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/U-S-oil-and-gas-rig-count-sees-largest-drop-in-14562607.php">6,000 energy sector jobs</a> lost in that state in recent months or the drop in the number of operating rigs in the U.S. over the past year. C-48 and C-69 didn’t cause that.</p>
      <p>We do need to compete with jurisdictions like Texas, however, and Kenney deserves credit for taking steps to improve Alberta’s competitiveness. I don’t doubt that he’ll be an effective salesman to his Texas audiences. Let’s just hope they haven’t been paying too close attention to some of his other rhetoric.</p>
