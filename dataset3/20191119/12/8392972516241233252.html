      <p>Viewers of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/">Coronation Street</a> have slammed the "sick" robbery plot as Daniel's laptop with videos of Sinead were stolen during her funeral.</p>
      <p>In last night's episode of the ITV soap (November 18 2019), Sinead's family and friends, including her husband Daniel, gathered to say goodbye to their loved one.</p>
      <p>Sinead <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-street-viewers-heartbroken-as-sinead-dies/">passed away a few weeks ago from cancer whilst Daniel read their son Bertie a bedtime story</a>.</p>

      </p>
      <p>During the funeral, a burglar broke into the flat and took Daniel's laptop along with other possessions.</p>
      <aside>Breaking into a dead woman's flat on the day of her funeral is a bit of a sick storyline.</aside>
      <p>However, Daniel's laptop had videos of Sinead on it that she filmed for Bertie before she died.</p>
      <p>When Daniel returned from the funeral, he was devastated to see his house had been robbed.</p>

      <p>When <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/a-short-history-of-coronation-streets-carla-connor/">Carla</a> took Daniel back to Ken's house, Daniel realised his laptop may have been taken and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/10-facts-about-alison-king-the-actress-who-plays-coronation-streets-carla-connor/">Carla</a> immediately called Peter, who stayed at the flat to call the police.</p>
      <p>When she told Peter about the laptop, he confirmed it wasn't there.</p>
      <p>Viewers weren't happy with the robbery plot calling it "sick".</p>
