      <p>With Polokwane City recently parting ways with their head coach, Soccer Laduma takes a look at all the coaching casualties, which took place so far in the Absa Premiership.</p>
      <p>It was confirmed earlier this month that Rise and Shine parted ways with their head coach Zlatko Krmpotic after a string of disappointing results at the club. </p>
      <p>Krmpotic becomes the sixth coaching casualty in the league so far this season, with Polokwane yet to appoint a permanent head coach. </p>

        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Benni McCarthy:</b>
      </p>
      <p>McCarthy’s exit from Cape Town City was arguably the most shocking news so far this season, after the Mother City-based club confirmed the termination of his contract after midnight on November 04. </p>
      <p>Replacement: Jan Olde Riekerink</p>
      <p>
        <b>Milutin ‘Micho’ Sredojevic:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Another shock to the football fraternity was when Coach Micho handed in his resignation at Orlando Pirates on August 16, the evening before the Bucs’ loss to Highlands Park in the MTN8 competition.</p>
      <p>Replacement: Rulani Mokwena (interim head coach)</p>
      <p>
        <b>Cavin Johnson:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Johnson was relieved from his role at AmaZulu FC on September 16, with the head coach having long been linked with an exit from the club following their poor start to the 2019/20 season.</p>
      <p>Replacement: Jozef Vukusic</p>
      <p>
        <b>Clinton Larsen:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Chippa United also relieved Larsen from the head coach position on September 16, although if anything, this news was of no surprise to the football fraternity.</p>
      <p>Replacement: Norman Mapeza</p>
      <p>
        <b>Lionel Soccoia:</b>
      </p>
      <p>The former Black Leopards head coach parted ways with the club on September 17.</p>
