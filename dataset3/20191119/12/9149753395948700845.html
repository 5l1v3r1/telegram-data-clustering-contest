      <h1>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order PC patch fixes load times and dynamic resolution</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:06:48+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/author/fraser-brown/" target="_blank">Fraser Brown</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-release-date/">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</a>'s first patch is here, though it's just a small one, fixing four issues that I've not encountered. So far, my galactic misadventures have been mercifully free of bugs and performance problems.</p>
      <p>If you've not been so lucky, hopefully the patch will sort you out. Here's everything it fixes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixed a texture flickering issue that would display on the screen while driving the AT-AT on Kashyyyk.</li>
        <li>Sometimes the input from the arrow keys would fail to respond within menus, this has now been fixed.</li>
        <li>Dynamic resolution settings will now save properly.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issued where the game could become slow and loading times longer than expected.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Some players have been complaining of framerate dips and other problems, particularly on Kashyyk, though they seem to be predominantly on PS4, not PC.  </p>
      <p>We ran some <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/jedi-fallen-order-pc-performance-is-decent-so-far-but-limited/">performance tests</a> last week and found the PC version to be decent, but limited. For more details on how the PC version fares, keep an eye out for our review. </p>
