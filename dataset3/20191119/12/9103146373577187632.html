      <p><u>RELIGION</u> <br/><br/>WAKISO -<b> Parishioners of St Stephen's Church of Uganda, Nansana, in Wakiso district are still in a celebratory mood following the election of their parish-priest, Rev. Dr. Ssalongo James Bukomeko as the new Bishop of the Anglican diocese of Mityana.</b><br/><br/>Alex Luganda, the Attorney General of Busoga Kingdom, who is a parishioner of Nansana is one of the Christians who were highly excited by Bukomeko's election.<br/><br/>"Rev. Bukomeko is a very hard-working cleric. He initiates big projects, which sometimes Christians regard as impossible. He nonetheless accomplishes them.  He is also a principled man of deep faith. I am sure he will be successful in his new ministry."</p>

      <p><i> </i><br/>Rev. Bukomeko thanked his parishioners for their prayers, to which he attributed his victory.<br/><br/>"I was firm because I knew you were praying for me. But towards the day of the elections, I got very many calls from you. A phone-call was coming in every three seconds. So, I began to get worried, wondering what I would tell you my Christians if things did not go according to your expectations."<br/><br/>Rev Bukomeko promised to serve God with total commitment upon his episcopal consecration, which is scheduled for February 2, 2020.</p>
