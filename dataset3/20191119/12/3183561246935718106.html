      <p>Months after the <i>Fast and Furious</i> franchise finally said “screw it” and <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/08/how-hobbs-shaw-finally-brought-sci-fi-into-the-fast-furious-franchise">went straight sci-fi</a>, it’s changing lanes once again.</p>
      <p>Netflix, along with <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2017/04/god-willing-one-day-fast-and-furious-could-head-to-space">Universal Pictures</a> and DreamWorks Animation, just revealed the first look and cast list for <i>Fast and Furious: Spy Racers</i>, <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2018/04/buckle-up-netflix-is-making-a-fast-furious-animated-series">the upcoming animated series based on</a> the long-running film franchise. Debuting December 26 on U.S. Netflix, the show follows Tony, the cousin of Vin Diesel’s character Dom Toretto, who is recruited with his friends to “infiltrate an elite racing league serving as a front for a nefarious crime organisation called SH1FT3R bent on world domination.”</p>
      <p>
        <i>Editor's note: Netflix Australia has yet to announce whether it'll be available here on December 26 as well.</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>Teen Wolf</i> star Tyler Posey is voicing Tony, and he’s joined by Diesel’s daughter, Similce Diesel, who voices a friend’s sister. <i>American Vandal</i>’s Jimmy Tatro, <i>Harry Potter</i> actor Luke Youngblood, and <i>Hamilton</i> star Renée Elise Goldsberry (who plays the team’s “secret agent liaison” Ms. Nowhere) are along for the ride too, just to name a few.</p>
      <p>The premise of the show sounds perfectly dumb and fun. Just the way we like it. Plus, like <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/watch-idris-elbas-2-minute-hobbs-shaw-origin-story-1838886819?_ga=2.256132875.1266605634.1574019403-1597414124.1522872342"><i>Hobbs and Shaw</i> before it</a>, some of the tech and cars sure do look futuristic. <i>Spy Racers</i> seems like a nice appetizer before the full franchise returns for part nine in summer 2020. Here are some more photos.</p>
