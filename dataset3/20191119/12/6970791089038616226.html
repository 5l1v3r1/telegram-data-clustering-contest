      <h1>Thousands Of Disney+ Subscribers Accounts Hacked + Sold On Dark Web</h1>

      <p>Overnight streaming giant Disney+ is going through a small rough patch. New reports claim the digital powerhouse is currently experiencing a publicized hacking.</p>
      <p>According to reports, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-50461171">thousands of subscribers’ accounts</a> have become compromised.</p>
      <blockquote>Since Disney+ went live, hackers have stolen thousands of customers’ accounts and put them up for sale on the dark web, according to a report. People waited on telephone and online chat lines for hours, and many still say that Disney has yet to sort their problems. Disney’s answer to Netflix, Disney+ is an online platform where fans can view its movies, short films and TV shows, including the Marvel and Star Wars franchises. Ten million people signed up in its first week.

      <p>Some reports claim the hacked accounts <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/19/hacked-disney-plus-accounts-said-to-be-on-sale-according-to-reports.html">have been posted online</a> and sold on the dark web.</p>
      <blockquote>Just hours after the service was rolled out, hackers hijacked user accounts and were either offering them for free on hacking forums or selling them for prices between $3 to $11, according to investigations by news site <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/thousands-of-hacked-disney-accounts-are-already-for-sale-on-hacking-forums/">ZDNet</a>. Users said hackers were accessing their Disney+ accounts, logging them out of their devices and then changing the email and password associated with that account, according to ZDNet.

      <p>Since last week, people <a href="https://twitter.com/Travel4vr/status/1194349581292584960">have confirmed hacking incidents</a> to their accounts.</p>

      <p>Some outlets <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/thousands-of-hacked-disney-accounts-are-already-for-sale-on-hacking-forums/">speculate the hacking might have</a> stemmed from weak passwords or leaked credentials.</p>
      <blockquote>Two users who spoke with <i>ZDNet </i>on the condition we do not share their names admitted that they reused passwords. However, other users said online that they did not, and had used passwords unique for their Disney+ accounts. This suggests that in some cases hackers gained access to accounts by using email and password combos leaked at other sites, while in other cases the Disney+ credentials might have been obtained from users infected with keylogging or info-stealing malware.
