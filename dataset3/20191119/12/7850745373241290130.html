      <h1>Vinka works with Inna on love song</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:22:21+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:22</time> by <a rel="author">NATHAN ATILUK</a></address>
      <p>A few months back, Vinka through her social media platforms said she would be releasing new music every month, and the former talent manager seems to mean business.</p>
      <p>After recently signing with Sony Entertainment, Vinka released her November serving last week. The song, Bebe, features Inna, a Romanian singer-songwriter with huge following.</p>
      <p>Bebe is a love song, a bit of stepping out of her comfort zone for the dancehall artiste. Vinka’s vocals on the song are, however, limited; the bigger percentage is dominated by Inna.</p>
      <p>Vinka, who speaks English, Kiswahili, Luganda and French, said during the release at Swangz Avenue offices in Industrial Area that Bebe is about love for one another and love for a community. The video is so good it reminded me of Game of Thrones with some scenes shot in dark places as if they were hiding from ghosts.</p>
      <p>Well, wait for Vinka’s December unveiling…</p>
