      <p>He said he should not be “aggressive” and instead said it was “more therapeutic boxing” as he joked about punching photographers on the side.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson left the ring as two more serious boxers entered, saying he would “quit while he’s ahead”.</p>

      <p>“He felt strong, punch-wise. He’s built for it, isn’t he? He’s stocky.”</p>
      <p>Asked how he thought Mr Johnson would perform in the ring against Mr Corbyn, he said: “I’d put me money on (Mr Johnson) because I think everyone wants to see Corbyn get knocked out.</p>
      <p>“He’d definitely win by a KO (knockout) – first round KO.”</p>
