      <h3>IN defense of the House Speaker, Albay Rep. Joey Salceda said the P55 million cauldron for the torch-lighting ceremony of the 2019 Southeast Asian Games (SEA Games) is “reasonable.” Cayetano heads the Philippine Southeast Asian Games Organizing Committe.</h3>
      <p>In a television interview, Salceda said the cauldron describes “the new and bolder character of the Filipino as coming of age and breaking into the field of emerging tigers.”</p>
      <p>“It personifies the new character of the Philippines being a strong economy,” said the Saceda said.</p>
      <p>“Yung P55 million pag tiningnan mo yung cauldron mukhang reasonable naman kaso ‘imeldific’ yung dating, may grandiosity,” he added.</p>
      <p>The chairman of the House Committee on Ways and Means said the SEA Games is a lump sum item in2019 national budget, amounting to P6 billion.</p>
      <p>Senate Minority Leader Franklin Drilon had questioned the P55 million cost of the design, foundation and construction of a stadium cauldron for the SEA Games.</p>
      <p>The Philippines is hosting the SEA Games from November 30 to December 11, 2019.</p>
      <p>According to Drilon, the P50 million could have been used to build at least 50 classrooms for the public schools.</p>
      <p>But Salceda corrected Drilon saying each classroom costs P2.5 million.</p>
      <p>“Wala namang classroom na P1 million ngayon. Karamihann ng classroom P2.5 million,” he said.</p>
      <p>He further said that the P6-billion budget is also “reasonable” and actually “small” for funding the hosting of the SEA Games.</p>
      <p>“Mukhang reasonable naman ‘yung P6 billion to stage games like that. P6 billion is already small,” the Albay representative added.</p>
