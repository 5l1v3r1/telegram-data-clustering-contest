      <h1>James Haskell's Bellator MMA boss delighted to see rugby star in the I'm A Celebrity jungle</h1>
      <h2>The former England rugby star joined fellow ex-athletes Ian Wright and Caitlyn Jenner in the jungle</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:27:43+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/donagh-corby/" target="_blank">Donagh Corby</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/james-haskell">James Haskell's</a> MMA promoter is delighted to see his fighter in the I'm A Celebrity jungle, despite the potential hit to his training that it could cause.</p>
      <p>The former England rugby star joined fellow ex-athletes <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/ian-wright">Ian Wright</a> and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/caitlyn-jenner">Caitlyn Jenner</a> in the jungle this year, just months after he announced his signing with top fight promotion <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/bellator-mma">Bellator MMA</a>.</p>
      <p>And speaking exclusively with Irish Mirror, Bellator's head of European operations David Green said that he knew about the 34-year-old's reality TV opportunity before he went in.</p>
      <p>"I'd known for a while, but there was a strict Non-Disclosure Agreement," said Green. "I don't think it affects our plans."</p>
      <p>"To be honest, James is a very big personality and that was one of the big attractions to us when we signed him and this will further his profile.</p>
      <p>"I'm A Celebrity is one of the biggest reality shows out there and if he gets to show a bit of his prowess in the jungle and come back to us that's great.</p>

      <p>"You have to look at these things in the round and the opportunities it presents, we brought him in because of who he is and his profile.</p>
      <p>"This can only increase his appeal and reach, which is never going to be a bad thing for <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/mma">MMA</a> and I think he's going to be very successful here."</p>
      <p>Haskell made headlines when it was announced he had signed with the MMA promotion just months after his retirement from rugby after a glittering career for <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/england-rugby-union-team">England</a> and Wasps.</p>

      <p>But since announcing his intention to fight an as-yet unconfirmed opponent next year, Haskell first jetted across the world to cover the <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/rugby-world-cup-2019">Rugby World Cup</a> in Japan for Sky Sports.</p>
      <p>And he is now away from training for a potential three weeks while competing to be crowned king of the jungle.</p>
      <p>But Green insists Haskell trained while in Japan, saying: "I think some people would be very surprised with how hard he is training.</p>

      <p>"Since we signed him he's been in the gym constantly, and for Japan in particular I was helping him find MMA gyms there because he wanted to train every day.</p>
      <p>"So if anything, he was improving the possibilities of people he could work with so I have no concerns about his commitment.</p>
      <p>"He takes great care of himself, he's a professional sportsman and he will make sure he is fully prepared for this fight."</p>
      <p>In fact, Green claims his only worry is that Haskell could drop a few weight classes thanks to the dietary options available in the jungle.</p>
      <p>"My only concern is that I signed a heavyweight, but if Caitlyn Jenner doesn't improve on these Bushtucker trials I might end up with a middleweight!"</p>
