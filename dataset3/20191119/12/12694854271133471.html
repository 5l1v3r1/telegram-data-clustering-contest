      <h1>Don’t get too excited about Apple’s surprise December event</h1>

        <b>Apple has started sending out invitations for a December event − but don’t get too excited. Rather than the launch of something shiny and new, it looks like it will be… a look back at some of the company’s favourite apps and games of the year.</b>
      </p>
      <p>We imagine it will be a small media gathering rather than a full-blown, live-streamed press event, but that hasn’t stopped tongues from wagging.</p>

      <p>Lance Ulanoff, who is the Editor-in-Chief of Lifewire Tech, posted what appears to be a screenshot of the invitation on Twitter. He says the event has been scheduled for December 2, and that it will take place in New York City.</p>

      <p>Though it appears that Apple didn’t want anybody who received the invitation from posting about it yet…</p>

      <p>Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman, who’s very reliable when it comes to all things Apple, has said that this will not be a product-focused event:</p>

      <p>We <i>had</i> been expecting Apple to hold another event before the end of 2019, but had pretty much given up hope when October and most of November went by without a peep from the company.</p>
      <p>The fact that Apple has launched the 16-inch <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/macbook-pro-2019-price-release-date-specs-3661278">MacBook Pro 2019</a> and <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/airpods-pro-release-date-price-specs-3949999">AirPods Pro</a> with very little fanfare over recent weeks didn’t exactly raise our levels of optimism.</p>
      <p>No leaks have indicated a new product is incoming at the December event, and announcing something so late would mean Apple lost out on a lot of festive sales.</p>
      <p>While we’re not expecting a big launch of any sort, we do have one key question. Could there be a discussion of the much-rumoured Apple “mega-bundle” which will reportedly see music, games and TV all brought together via Apple’s new platforms, <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-arcade-release-date-price-3683862">Apple Arcade</a> and <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/apple-tv-plus-release-date-price-3682367">Apple TV Plus</a>?</p>

      </p>
      <p>This all encompassing mega-bundle appears to be Apple’s endgame, but when it might arrive (if ever) remains a mystery for now.</p>
