      <p>While much has been revealed about the creation of <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/artists/bring-me-the-horizon/">Bring Me The Horizon</a>’s Ludens, the band have just released a mini documentary on the making of their ace new single and what things were <i>really</i> like.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.kerrang.com/features/bring-me-the-horizons-oli-sykes-we-need-to-teach-people-about-compassion/">Speaking to Kerrang!</a> about the creation of the song, which is featured in Hideo Kojima’s new video game Death Stranding, frontman Oli Sykes revealed: “They didn’t give us any instructions for what it was supposed to sound or be like. It was a Monday at this point and our management were like, ‘It has to be done by Saturday, otherwise they can’t use it.’ There was no leeway on that. We’ve never had to write a song in five days before and we weren’t sure if we could do it. And we didn’t want to put out something shit, obviously! But we were like, ‘Well, we might as well just try, and if we don’t like it or it doesn’t happen, then whatever – we can work on it for something else.’</p>

      </p>
      <p>“We hit the ground running, and I’d been following the game closely because I’m a big fan of Kojima and his work,” Oli added of the process. “I went back and dug through all the trailers and fan theories, just trying to get my head around what the video game meant. I started looking at how I can use that theme and apply it to something a bit bigger than the game, and what was on my mind, too – and lyrically I had an obvious point of inspiration. We’ve never made a song for a game before, so it was a chance to do something that felt a bit more cinematic. We dug through the original Matrix soundtrack and stuff like that – that cyberpunk, nu-metal stuff – and that kind of inspired it. We didn’t have much choice other than to have fun with it, and just make something and see what came out. We can be quite anal about our music, and we just go over and over and over it. It’s easy to second-guess a song to the point that you actually get rid of it. But we didn’t have the time to do that with Ludens, so we just went with our gut.”</p>
      <p>As you can see in the hilarious behind-the-scenes look at Ludens, the making of the single “isn’t pretty”, as Oli wrote in a caption…</p>

      <p>Following the release of Ludens, <a href="https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/oli-sykes-says-bring-me-the-horizon-hope-to-release-multiple-records-next-year/">Oli also spoke to NME</a> and revealed that the band are thinking of changing up their release format in the future.</p>
      <p>“Ludens will be the first song you hear from the new record,” he said. “We’re not going to do an album again, maybe ever. We’re thinking about doing shorter records. I don’t want to say we’re going to do something and not live up to it, but the plan is to release multiple records next year.”</p>
