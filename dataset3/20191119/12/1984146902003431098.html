      <h1>FA Cup replay rules: When extra-time, penalties and the fourth substitute come into play this season</h1>
      <h2>The Black Cats take on Gillingham in the FA Cup first-round replay at Priestfield</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:31:37+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:31</time> by <a rel="author">Stuart Jamieson</a></address>
      <p>Sunderland could face extra-time and penalties tonight, should their FA Cup replay at Gillingham end in a draw.</p>
      <p>While competitions such as the EFL Cup and the EFL Trophy have dispensed with extra-time, it is still played in the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/fa-cup">FA Cup.</a></p>
      <p>Replays have been scrapped from the fifth-round stage, but tonight's first-round replay at Priestfield could go all the way to penalties.</p>
      <p>The FA Cup rules state:</p>
      <p>"When a replayed match is drawn after 90 minutes, an extra 30 minutes shall be played, and 15 minutes shall be played in each half.</p>
      <p>"If the score is still level at the end of extra time, the winner shall be determined by the taking of kicks from the penalty mark in accordance with the procedure adopted by the International Football Association Board."</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland-afc">The Black Cats</a> famously lost a penalty shoot-out at Wembley last season in the Checkatrade Trophy Final, but given the important League One fixtures on the horizon, Sunderland boss <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/phil-parkinson">Phil Parkinson</a> will be hoping his side can get the job done in 90 minutes tonight.</p>
      <p>However, if we do have an extra 90 minutes of action tonight, then Sunderland would be able to make a fourth substitution.</p>
      <p>The rules state: "In the event that extra time is played in any match a Club may at its discretion use one additional substitute player, (a fourth in total) from the nominated seven substitutes, during such period of extra time."</p>
      <p>The winners of tonight's match face a second-round home tie against either Doncaster or AFC Wimbledon.</p>
