      <p>It was found in an area where Robin Hood is once said to have robbed the rich and given to the poor.</p>
      <p>Now, this medieval sapphire ring discovered in what was once historic <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/sherwood-forest">Sherwood Forest</a> is going up for sale - and is expected to fetch at least £25,000.</p>
      <p>The 15th century ring was found three years ago at Kirton, not far from the remaining part of the forest.</p>
      <p>It was made around 250 years after the time when Robin Hood is thought to have roamed the area.    </p>

      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottinghamshire-county-council">Nottinghamshire County Council</a> archaeologist Emily Gillott said: "A ring like this would have been worn by someone of extremely high status - perhaps by a bishop visiting our own Rufford Abbey or Laxton Castle.</p>
      <p>"It was a reflection of life for people in this sort of position, as opposed to a peasant who could only dream of owning such a valuable item."</p>
      <p>The rare ring, which was discovered by a member of the public, is now being auctioned by Christie's with an estimated sale price of £25,000 to £35,000.</p>
      <p>Under the rules which cover found treasure, the finder will split the proceeds half and half with the landowner.</p>
      <p>The ring, which is 21mm in length, contains a sapphire measuring 9.8mm x 7.8mm, and has a gold mount with engraved figures depicting Saint Elizabeth of Hungary and the Infant Christ.</p>

      <p>Christie's says "a sapphire of this size and quality is highly unusual in jewels of this period".</p>
      <p>It adds: "The source of the sapphire is from the East, and is likely to have been sourced from one of the traditional mines in either Ceylon, Burma or Kashmir, before being subsequently brought across Asia to a Mediterranean seaport.</p>
      <p>"The stone would have then been sold in Genoa or Venice where it was customary for merchants to acquire precious stones to trade in the cities of the north.</p>
      <p>"Prized for its intrinsic value, beauty and rarity, the sapphire was believed to keep the wearer from poverty and, being the colour of the Virgin and of the heavens, protected the wearer’s chastity, comforted the heart, expelled envy and detected fraud and witchcraft."</p>

      <p>Sherwood Forest once covered a huge swathe of land from north of Nottingham city up to the edge of Doncaster, but now comprises just 375 hectares.</p>
      <p>* The ring features in the 'Important Jewels' auction which takes place at Christie's in London on November 27.</p>
