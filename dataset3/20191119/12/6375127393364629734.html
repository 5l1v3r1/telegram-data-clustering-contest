      <h3>WE haven't heard the last of Senator Franklin Drilon.</h3>
      <p>A day after hitting the extravagant cost of the cauldron to be used during the Southeast Asian Games, the Minority floor leader is now questioning sports officials over the P700 million fund they released toÂ  a private foundation for the 30th edition of the biennial meet.</p>
      <p>The meet will kick off in elaborate rites on Nov. 30 at the Philippine Arena in Bocaue, Bulacan, with close to 12,000 athletes and officials from 10 nations vying for honors in 56 sports scheduled for 12 days with the New Clark City in Pampanga as the main hub.</p>
      <p>"Bakit po ito binigay sa pribadong sector? Sino po ang nag-utos? Para saan po itong P700 million? Ito po ba ay legal na ilipat po sa isang private foundation ang P700 million na pera ng bayan?" the opposition senator told DZMM in a radio interview yesterday morning.</p>
      <p>(Why was this given to a private sector? Who ordered it? What would it be used for? Is it legal to transfer P700 million public funds to a private foundation?)</p>
      <p>The privately formed Philippine Southeast Asian Games Organizing Committee (PHISGOC) Foundation Inc. is chaired by House Speaker Alan Peter Cayetano.</p>
      <p>On Monday, Drilon questioned the P50-million money spent on the cauldron, saying "it's an extravagance that is so unnecessary and somebody has to answer for this".</p>
      <p>The senator told reporters that he planned to call for a Senate probe but only after the games because the more than 1,000 athletes carrying the national colors in the 12-day, 10-nation meet should be supported first.</p>
      <p>According to him, the Philippine Sports Commission was tasked with constructing the cauldron, while the Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BSDA) built the other facilities.</p>
      <p>The foundation was formally recognized by President Duterte on Jan. 25 by issuing Memorandum Circular 56, which directs all government agencies and government-owned and controlled corporations to extend their full support to the body.</p>
      <p>Last July, Duterte said government should handle preparations for the SEA Games due to alleged corruption in PHISGOC Foundation Inc., which its chief operating officer Ramon Suzara denied.</p>
      <p>The cauldron's design alone cost P4.4 million, foundationP13.4 million and its construction P32 million.</p>
      <p>"This is one expensive kaldero (cauldon)," Drilon said, shaking his head.</p>
