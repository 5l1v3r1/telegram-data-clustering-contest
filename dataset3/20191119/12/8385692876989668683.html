      <p>If you've been wondering how much will the <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/motorola">Motorola</a> Razr foldable cost in Europe, well, the <a href="https://nl.letsgodigital.org/opvouwbare-telefoons/motorola-razr-kopen-prijs/">information just surfaced</a>. Unfortunately, the device will be more expensive in the US.</p>
      <p>According to Letsgodigital, the device will be priced at €1,680 ($1,860) in Europe (Sweden, at least), unlocked. As a comparison, the device will cost $1,500 in the US. So, as you can see, those of you from Sweden will have to pay almost $400 more in order to get the Motorola Razr.</p>
      <p>Do note that this is just leaked info at the moment, and this price tag is rumored for Sweden. The information does come from a reliable source, though, so keep that in mind.</p>

      <h3>The Motorola Razr will cost around €1,600 in most countries in Europe</h3>
      <p>The source notes that the Motorola Razr will become available in Sweden from January 24, which is rather specific. Other European countries (like the Netherlands, for example) will get the device around that time, and it is said to be a bit more affordable, and cost around €1,600 ($1,770).</p>
      <p>So, the Motorola Razr will be a bit more affordable outside Scandinavia, it seems, but it will still be considerably more expensive than in the US. Chances are that the rest of Europe will see a price tag close to €1,600.</p>
      <p>The Motorola Razr is Motorola's very first foldable smartphone. The device got <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2019/11/motorola-razr-is-back-as-a-foldable-futuristic-smartphone.html">announced</a> in the US quite recently, where it will be available exclusively from Verizon.</p>

      <p>The device has been inspired by the original Motorola RAZR, which arrived back in 2004. That device managed to become one of Motorola's most iconic smartphones over time. So, it's not surprising that Motorola decided to revive it as a foldable.</p>
      <p>The new Motorola Razr does bring a really compelling design to the table. Motorola seems to have solved the hinge really well on this phone, which was one of Samsung's main headaches with the Galaxy Fold.</p>
      <p>Motorola also did not request users to be extra careful with this phone, as Samsung did for the Galaxy Fold. The Motorola Razr even comes with a special coating for water resistance.</p>

      <p>The device includes a capacitive fingerprint scanner which is located on its 'chin'. Speaking of which, the phone does include a rather large chin, reminiscent of the original RAZR.</p>
      <h3>The phone includes two OLED displays, the Snapdragon 710 &amp; 6GB of RAM</h3>
      <p>The device features a 6.2-inch foldable P-OLED display on the inside, and a 2.7-inch secondary G-OLED display on the outside. Android 9 Pie comes pre-installed on the device, while the phone is fueled by the Snapdragon 710.</p>
      <p>The device includes 6GB of RAM and 128GB of non-expandable storage. A 16-megapixel main camera is included here, along with a 5-megapixel secondary shooter A 3.5mm headphone jack is not included in the package.</p>
