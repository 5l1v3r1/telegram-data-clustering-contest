      <p>Harry Maguire has revealed how Manchester United sent him a signed shirt after he was knocked out in the FA Youth Cup final against them.</p>
      <p>Centre back Maguire was playing for boyhood club Sheffield United in 2011 when he collided with Red Devils striker Ravel Morrison.</p>
      <p>Maguire was knocked unconscious from the clash of heads and was required to be taken away on a stretcher.</p>
      <p>The England international joined the Red Devils for a record £80million this summer, and has recalled the "classy gesture" after the incident.</p>

      <p>“It was just after half-time when it happened. I had a clash of heads with Ravel and actually got knocked out,“ Maguire told Inside United.</p>
      <p>"It was the only time I’ve been knocked out in my career, touch wood. It was a nasty blow and I was in hospital overnight.</p>
      <p>“Obviously it was disappointing to go off and not see the end of the game, when the medals and the trophy were presented.</p>

      <p>“But then someone got in touch from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> and checked I was okay.</p>
      <p>“They sent me a Manchester United shirt, and just said: 'Good luck for the future, you’re a good, promising young player, keep your head down and so on.'</p>
      <p>“It was a nice touch from the club and just shows what a classy club United is.”</p>
      <p>Maguire returns to Bramall Lane on Sunday afternoon with United and hopes he is given a good reception from his former fans.</p>
      <p>“I’ll be back at Bramall Lane and I'm sure I’ll get a better reception than I did from the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> fans when they came to Old Trafford!” said Maguire, who made 166 appearances for the Blades.</p>
      <p>“They've been great with me ever since, the Sheffield United fans, so I’ve got a lot to thank them for. The crowd got right on my side [from the start]."</p>
