      <p>The daughter of one of Britain’s “first gay dads” has spoken out about why she is happy that her father has found love with her “ex-boyfriend”.</p>
      <p>Saffron Drewitt-Barlow, 19, is totally fine with her dad, Barrie Drewitt-Barlow, taking up with 25-year-old Scott Hutchison, who she used to be linked to, she wrote in an Instagram post.</p>
      <p>“Scott is one of my best mates and I am happy that he and daddy can finally feel comfortable enough to talk about their relationship,” Saffron wrote in a post shared by Barrie.</p>
      <p>The<a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/18/daughter-of-britains-first-gay-dads-is-happy-father-is-dating-her-ex-boyfriend/"><i> New York Post </i></a>reports that the teenager revealed that things were never romantic with Hutchison, and that she was only pretending to date him to keep his sexuality secret after he came out to her years ago.</p>
      <p>“It is time you all knew there was NEVER any more than a friendship between us…,” she wrote. “Scott had told me he was gay years ago and I agreed to help him keep his secret by pretending to be his girlfriend. That, I’m happy to say, was it!”</p>
      <p>Barrie, 50, shared his daughter’s post from her private account on his own, with the caption: “Love my baby girl so much x this should shut a few of those tw*ts up!”</p>

      <p>Barrie said that while Tony is his “true love,” they grew apart in recent years and were sleeping in separate bedrooms. That fact, together with Tony’s deteriorating health following a 2006 cancer diagnosis, led them to drift “into a platonic relationship.”</p>
      <p>Saffron said she and her siblings are totally accepting of their dad’s new relationship with Scott, who helps to care for ailing Tony.</p>
      <p>“My parents are my best friends and although ‘officially’ they are not together like that any more they remain the best of friends and care for each other better than any other parents I know,” she wrote.</p>
      <p>“My brothers, dad and I are extremely happy for Scott and daddy who cares day and night for my sick dad.”</p>
      <p>Tony and Barrie Drewitt-Barlow were England’s first same-sex couple to be named on a birth certificate as parents.</p>
      <p>Barrie opened up about their new unconventional living arrangement to The Sun on Saturday.</p>
      <p>“I’ve fallen in love with Scott and he has done the same,” Barrie, 50, said.</p>
      <p>“I feel stupid at my age to have these feelings about someone other than Tony and half my age. But when you know something is right, it’s right. We have not made definite plans but I would like to marry Scott.”</p>
      <p>Scott, 25, and Barrie are continuing to live in the family’s $US7.5 million (A$11.02 million) Florida mansion, along with Tony and Saffron and the rest of the family.</p>

      <p>Barrie told the paper that his estranged husband and Saffron are accepting of the relationship.</p>
      <p>“I’m not having a midlife crisis — if I was having one I’d buy myself a Porsche 911,” Barrie said.</p>
      <p>“This is the real deal. But not everyone will get it, as our living arrangements are unorthodox — I feel like I’m living in a commune, we are all still living together.”</p>
      <p>Barrie and Tony in 1999 welcomed twins born to a surrogate and declared themselves “Britain’s first gay dads,” The Sun said.</p>

      <p>The couple became civil partners in 2006 and married in 2014 once it became legal to do so in the UK, the report said. They have five children.</p>
