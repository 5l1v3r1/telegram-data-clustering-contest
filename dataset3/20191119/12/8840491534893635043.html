      <p>TOP Irish chefs are urging home cooks to whip up a storm of tasty dishes from a new cookbook in aid of the Irish Cancer Society. The new downloadable cookbook, priced €5, is available to buy online now, with all proceeds going to support people affected by prostate cancer.</p>
      <p>Go Wild in the Kitchen is the brain child of Bobby Power, creator of Go Wild Magazines, who brought together a collection of delicious recipes from chefs based along the Wild Atlantic Way.</p>
      <p>As most of the chefs featured in the book are male, he used the opportunity to raise awareness of prostate cancer, and raise money for the society’s cancer research and free support services for those affected by the illness. Over 3,600 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer in Ireland each year.</p>
      <p>The book features over 30 recipes and stunning photography from three distinct areas along the Wild Atlantic Way - the north coast, mid-west and southern region. Mouth-watering dishes on the menu include glazed Bourbon steak, hot smoked salmon and crusted pork loin to wow with at dinner time. The tasty creations come from top chefs in Ashford Castle and Mulranny Park Hotel, to name just a few.</p>
      <p>The book was launched by broadcaster Bobby Kerr, a cancer survivor. He said: “Every year over 40,000 people hear the dreaded words ‘you have cancer’. In 2015, one of those people was me. Thankfully years of cancer research had developed smart ways of treating the disease and this ultimately saved my life.</p>
      <p>“I’m delighted to help launch Go Wild in the Kitchen and urge any foodies to download the book and help raise crucial funds to help men affected by prostate cancer.”</p>
      <p>November is Prostate Cancer Awareness Month and people across Ireland are also participating in Movember to support men affected by this form of cancer. For more information visit <a href="http://www.movember.ie/">www.movember.ie</a>.</p>
