      <p>“I pictured her in a more adult situation where she had a sinking feeling in her gut and wanted to ask the question,” Bell says. “Was I going to pat her on the head and go ‘Stop thinking about that, I already told you, it’s fine, believe me?’ Or would I want to produce the kind of person who goes ‘I’m sorry, I really do need more information on this’?”</p>
      <p>Bell also shares some of her family’s Christmas traditions.</p>
      <p>“Dax [Shepard] introduced the idea of opening gifts on Christmas morning from youngest to oldest, which I really like,” she says. “I’m able to talk my daughters through who gave them each gift. I try to reiterate that these presents don’t just fall from the sky; they came from a thoughtful individual whom we need to thank.”</p>

      <p>She adds, “Another habit I want to pass down to them is to not get stressed out about the holidays. It’s tempting to think that everything has to be perfect. But if we decide at 2 p.m. on Christmas Eve to order takeout instead of cook, I will have a smile on my face.”</p>
