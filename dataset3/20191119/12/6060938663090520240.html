      <h1>ISSF World Cup Final: Sanjeev Rajput misses out on finals by a point</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:00:55+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author">PTI</a></address>
      <p>PUTIAN (China): India's <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sanjeev-Rajput">Sanjeev Rajput</a> missed out on the finals by a point in the prestigious World Cup Finals for the year's top-ranked rifle and pistol shooters on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Rising Czech star Filip Nepejchal and Briton Seonaid Mcintosh took day one honours, winning the men's and women's 50m rifle 3 positions (3P) gold medals respectively.</p>
      <p>The seasoned Rajput, who has already secured an Olympic quota, shot 1153 to claim the ninth spot in a low-scoring qualification round. Polish shooter Tomasz Bartnik took the eighth and final qualification spot with an effort of 1154.</p>
      <p>Sanjeev would have made it through even if he had tied with Tomasz, given he had two more inner 10s than the shooter from Poland.</p>
      <p>Akhil Sheoran, the second Indian to have made the cut in the prestigious International <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Shooting">Shooting</a> Sport Federation (<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/ISSF">ISSF</a>) season-ending showpiece, finished 13th with a score of 1147.</p>
      <p>In the women's 3P, India's Anjum Moudgil also finished outside the top eight final qualifying spots, shooting a score of 1147 to finish in 13th position overall.</p>
