      </p>
      <p>The actress — who plays <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/sinead-oconnor-hollyoaks/">Sinead O’Connor</a> in the Channel 4 soap — took to Twitter on Monday to inform her follows that she was going to talk about her recent diagnosis in a new video.</p>
      <p>She uploaded the clip onto YouTube — which will be the first of a new on-going video blog.</p>

      <p>The first instalment — entitled ‘I Have High Functioning Autism. This is me’ — sees Stephanie speak about her recent diagnosis.</p>
      <p>Explaining her reasons for wanting to make a video blog, Stephanie said in the clip: ‘I just like to reach out to people — like-minded people who can give me a bit of advice and help me, because I’m only human and I have things that I need help with too.’</p>

      <p>‘I’ve been diagnosed with a few mental health issues. I’m not ready to talk about them all yet. I don’t know if I ever will be’</p>
      <p>‘This is a lot for me — doing this. I can’t make decisions for myself, so I texted me mum and asked if I should do it or not. She said to sleep on it. I feel like I’ve thought about it for a while, and I feel like it really helps me.’</p>
      <p>After informing viewers of her diagnosis, she continued: ‘I’ve guessed I just went under the radar with this, but it explains a lot to me.’</p>
      <p>‘I think since knowing I’m more aware of what I’m doing, but I’ve struggled my whole life with it, it’s actually quite sad.’</p>

      <p>‘My mum felt a bit gutted for me because she was like, ‘I knew that you struggled with these things, but I didn’t even think…’ I think she felt upset at the way my little head must’ve been struggling for so many years.’</p>
      <p>In the video, the actress told her viewers that she hoped her blog would help others, and that it would also be a way that she could receive help and tips from those watching as well.</p>
      <p>Stephanie has received acclaim for her portrayal of Sinead in Hollyoaks, and the character was recently seen <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/31/hollyoaks-spoilers-sami-maalik-sinead-oconnor-romance-cards-couple-finally-kiss-10495467/">starting a new relationship with Sami Maalik</a> (Rishi Nair). However, problems ensued <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/hollyoaks-spoilers-wedding-day-drama-for-sami-maalik-and-sinead-shelby-but-will-the-ceremony-go-ahead-11026421/">when Sinead didn’t turn up for her own wedding day</a>, after it was revealed her and Sami had fallen out on holiday.</p>
