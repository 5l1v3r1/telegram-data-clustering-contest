        <b>Earlier, Donald Trump announced that bilateral national security teams would start working on a solution to Ankara’s purchase of S-400 systems from Russia and the impact that the Russian air defence systems could have on the US-made F-35 jets.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that he told Donald Trump that if the US stance on the F-35 jets persists, Turkey will have to seek other alternatives for its defence needs.</p>
      <blockquote>"We told Trump that we would not take a step back on the S-400. We agreed to resolve the issue. I once again explained how we approached the purchase of the S-400, and he acknowledges our innocence. I once again spoke about the injustice of the F-35 problem. We are not clients, but partners, we have already paid $1.4 billion. If we don’t agree, then we will start looking for alternatives in the medium term," Erdogan said.</blockquote>
      <p>The United States has repeatedly objected to Ankara’s purchase of the S-400s, saying that the weapons system is incompatible with NATO security standards and might compromise the operations of the new fifth-generation F-35 fighter jets. Washington called upon Turkey to cancel the deal with Russia and instead acquire Patriot missile defense systems from the United States.</p>
      <p>In July, the US suspended <a href="https://sputniknews.com/world/201911151077318307-turkish-us-officials-start-joint-work-to-asses-impact-of-russia-made-s-400s-on-us-f-35s---report/">Turkey's participation in the F-35 program</a>, adding that the country would be completely removed from the project by late March 2020.</p>
      <p>Turkey refused to abandon the deal with Russia. However, even after the latter completed the delivery of the main batch of S-400 components, US officials have still continued urging Ankara against putting the systems into operation.</p>
