      <h1>Tyne and Wear fire chiefs criticise 'finger pointing' in Grenfell Tower fire report</h1>
      <h2>Fire chiefs in Tyne and Wear have criticised the report into the Grenfell Tower fire over issues it raised with the response of the London Fire Brigade</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:11:26+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:11</time> by <a rel="author">James Harrison</a></address>
      <p>Fire chiefs in Tyne and Wear have slammed "finger pointing" in the inquiry into the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/grenfell-tower-fire">Grenfell Tower fire</a> .</p>
      <p>The London Fire Brigade was criticised for "serious shortcomings" and systemic failures in its response to the blaze at the London tower block, which lead to the deaths of 72 people.</p>
      <p>But regional leaders at the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/tyne-and-wear-fire-and-rescue-service">Tyne and Wear Fire and Rescue Authority</a> (TWFRA) have criticised the findings, which they claimed attacked the response to the blaze more than the failings which caused the tragedy.</p>
      <p>"I would be disappointed if I was a London Fire Brigade firefighter, because there is some finger pointing in [the inquiry's] report," said Labour councillor Michael Butler, of <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland-council">Sunderland City Council.</a></p>
      <p>"Firefighters enter the profession to save lives and I don't think some of those comments are fair."</p>
      <p>Coun Butler was backed by Liberal Democrat Tom Woodwark, of <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-city-council">Newcastle City Council</a> , who said "inaction" following previous tower block fires had was partly to blame for the Grenfell blaze.</p>
      <p>"I think we have to be clear about the difference between individual firefighters and what they did in individual situations and the response LFB was able to give," he added.</p>
      <p>"There's no criticism of individual firefighters acting on their own initiative, the report said there were failures by the fire brigade and in terms of communication between the fire brigade, ambulance services and police."</p>
      <p>The councillors were speaking at Monday's meeting of the TWFRA, which updated members on the findings of the Grenfell inquiry.</p>
      <p>The committee also heard about Friday's fire at the Cube student accommodation, in Bolton, Greater Manchester, in which, like Grenfell Tower, external cladding is thought to have been a factor.</p>
      <p>According to brigade bosses there are <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/grenfell-fire-cladding-north-east-17278647">three tower blocks in Tyne and Wear</a> which still have potentially dangerous cladding, down from 19 in the immediate aftermath of the Grenfell Tower fire.</p>
      <p>Fire chiefs have refused to name publicly which high rises still have the cladding, although owners, operators and tenants of the buildings are aware.</p>
      <p>Assistant Chief Fire Officer, Alan Robson, said: "After Grenfell Tower, the fire authority completed a programme of work, including working with all high rise operators and owners and since the incident this has resulted in corrective action.</p>
      <p>"However, in light of the publication of the report, further information will be required, including working with local authorities to ensure the risk remains as low as reasonably practicable."</p>
