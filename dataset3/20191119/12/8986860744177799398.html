      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:26:54+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:26</time> by <a rel="author">‌ Qwame Benedict</a></address>
      <p>The leader and founder of Anointed Palace Chapel Rev. Obofour some few hours ago was reported on some portals in the country to have said that he wouldn’t work for God to take the glory.</p>
      <p>After the publication, some sections of social media users took to social media to bash him for making such a comment regarded as blasphemous.</p>
      <p>Well, the rich pastor has himself reacted to the video which has since gone viral stating that none of the content is true.</p>
      <p>According to Rev. Obofour who is also known as Iron Boy has stated that the said rival video has been edited by some of his colleagues’ pastors who want his downfall to taint his hard earn reputation.</p>
      <p>Watch the video below:</p>

      <p>Obofour rather rained generational curse on the unknown editor who edited that said video saying that he together with his parents, unborn children and grandchildren would suffer till the end of the world.</p>
      <p>He added that all epilepsy he has cured from since the start of his ministry would go upon the editor’s unborn children as well as the family of whichever lady he prepares to marry.</p>
