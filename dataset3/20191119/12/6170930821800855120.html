      <h1>Donald Trump gets Ukraine phone memo timeline backwards</h1>

      <blockquote>"They never thought ... that I was going to release that call and I really had no choice because Adam Schiff made up a call." <br/><pic src="https://static.politifact.com/rulings/tom-false.png" width="100"/><cite>— <a href="https://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/">Donald Trump</a> on Friday, November 15th, 2019 in an interview with Dan Bongino</cite></blockquote>
      <p>President Donald Trump argues that his July 25 phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky was "perfect," and that Democrats have distorted it to build their case for impeachment.</p>
      <p>In an interview with conservative show host Dan Bongino, Trump said a false rendition of that call by House Intelligence chairman Adam Schiff, D-Calif., forced him to release the <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6429022/Trump-Zelensky-Call.pdf">readout of that call</a>.</p>
      <p>"They never thought, Dan, that I was going to release that call, and I really had no choice because Adam Schiff made up a call," Trump <a href="https://youtu.be/yCB88vRDss0?t=372">said Nov. 15</a>. "He said the president said this, and then he made up a call."</p>
      <p>The problem with Trump’s statement is that Schiff spoke after the White House released the memo of the phone call, not before.</p>
      <h3>The timeline</h3>
      <p><b>Sept. 9, 2019:</b> Michael Atkinson, inspector general of the intelligence community, <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6422139/2019-09-09-ICIG-Ltr.pdf">notifies</a> Rep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, that there was a whistleblower complaint of "urgent concern."</p>
      <p><b>Sept. 19, 2019:</b> Atkinson <a href="https://intelligence.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=699">briefs</a> the House Intelligence Committee in a closed-door session.</p>
      <p><b>Sept. 24, 2019: </b>House Democrats <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/pelosi-top-democrats-privately-discuss-creation-of-select-committee-for-impeachment/2019/09/24/af6f735a-dedf-11e9-b199-f638bf2c340f_story.html">launch</a> a formal impeachment inquiry.</p>
      <p><b>Sept. 25, 2019: </b>The White House releases a declassified <a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6429022/Trump-Zelensky-Call.pdf">summary</a> of the July 25 telephone call between Trump and Zelensky.</p>
      <p><b>Sept. 26, 2019:</b> Schiff makes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN4CJ8MYLTY">opening remarks</a> at a hearing with Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence. Maguire was questioned because he <a href="https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2019/sep/25/what-whistleblower-law-says-about-sharing-complain/">had not forwarded</a> the inspector general’s findings to conference.</p>
      <h3>Trump complained before about Schiff’s words</h3>
      <p>At that Sept. 26 hearing, Schiff offered a <a href="https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2019/sep/30/context-adam-schiffs-dramatized-version-trump-zele/">dramatized synopsis</a> of Trump’s call with Zelensky. He described rhetorically the nature of Trump’s message to Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Trump later latched on to Schiff’s words, saying he was lying to the public.</p>
      <p>"Rep. Adam Schiff illegally made up a FAKE &amp; terrible statement, pretended it to be mine," Trump tweeted <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1178643854737772545">Sept. 30</a>.</p>

      <p>We can find no other version of Schiff describing the call before the summary emerged.</p>
      <p>We reached out to the White House and did not hear back.</p>
      <h3>Our ruling</h3>
      <p>Trump said that the White House released a summary of his call with Zelensky after Schiff gave a false rendition of the call.</p>
      <p>The summary came out before Schiff described the nature of the call at a hearing.</p>
      <p>We rate this claim False.</p>
