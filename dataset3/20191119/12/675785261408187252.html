      <p>A pet dog made a lucky escape after it was attacked by a black swan while swimming in a lake.</p>
      <p>The golden retriever, named Xishi, was filmed doggy-paddling along the edge of the artificial lake in the city of Chengdu, capital of Sichuan Province in south-western China.</p>
      <p>A black swan approached Xishi with its wings open before attacking pooch Xishi on the head.</p>
      <p>The black swan is one of several captive-bred specimens kept by the management office of the Hengda Jinbi Tianxia Residential District.</p>
      <p>The dog's owner - named only as Ms Zhang - is heard shouting: "Oh no. Here comes the swan!</p>

      <p>"Xishi, leave! Come here!"</p>
      <p>The territorial black swan jumps on Xishi’s back and begins hitting the dog with its wings and pecking at its head.</p>

      <p>The dog manages to keep itself above water and swims to the safety of the shore.</p>
      <p>"That's one aggressive swan!" added Ms Zhang, after calling her pet back to the walkway.</p>

      <p>Two family members of Ms Zhang tried to pull the dog out of water while she looked out for the swan, which can be seen gliding away after it is satisfied it has repelled the intruder.</p>
      <p>Ms Zhang said neither her dog nor the swan was injured during the incident.</p>
