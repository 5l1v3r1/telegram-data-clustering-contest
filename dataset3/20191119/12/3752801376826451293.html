      <h1>Stellenbosch guard 'hit-and-run': State rejects plea proposal, accused to stand trial</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:53:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:53</time> by <a rel="author">Jenna Etheridge</a></address>
      <p>A man caught on CCTV driving over security guard Mzwanele Wellem has failed in his bid to cut a deal with the State, it emerged in the Stellenbosch Regional Court on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Johan Steyn, dressed in a black K-Way fleece top and jeans, and who is out on R2 000 bail, will now stand trial.</p>
      <p>He listened as his lawyer Bruce Hendricks confirmed they had received a letter from the Western Cape Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP).</p>
      <p>"They have indicated that they do not accept the plea and sentencing proposal by the defence," said Hendricks.</p>
      <p>According to the letter, Steyn was informed that the DPP had decided to proceed with prosecuting him on a charge of attempted murder.</p>
      <p>"I consider the only appropriate sentence in this matter to be one of direct imprisonment," the letter states.</p>
      <p>Hendricks had previously told News24 that the proposal set out the circumstances surrounding the incident at Die Boord shopping complex on April 30, as well as Steyn's personal circumstances.</p>
      <p>He indicated in court on Tuesday that they had received the charge sheet and further particulars, and that the video footage would not be disputed.</p>
      <p>The State is expected to show the video footage in court.</p>
      <p>Steyn will appear again in February next year for a pre-trial.</p>
      <p>Wellem had only been working at the shopping complex for a month when the incident happened.</p>
      <p>Steyn, who owns a general building repairs and maintenance business, said in an affidavit for his bail application: "It is and has always been my contention that I have not committed any offence as alleged in this matter."</p>
      <p>Wellem told <a href="https://www.matiemedia.org/my-life-will-never-be-the-same-says-stellenbosch-security-guard-who-was-driven-over/">MatieMedia</a> that his life would never be the same again and that the scars he bore were a reminder of what had happened.</p>
      <p>In the video, which went viral on social media, the driver of a white bakkie can be seen talking to a security guard outside the shopping complex.</p>
      <p>The guard gestures to the driver to not drive in his intended direction, seemingly indicating that it is a one-way road.</p>
      <p>The interaction goes on for a few seconds, before the driver runs over the security guard in full view of the people in the parking lot.</p>
      <p>One onlooker tries to stop the vehicle, which can be seen speeding off, leaving the guard motionless on the ground.</p>
