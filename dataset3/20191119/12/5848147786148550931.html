            <u>Step 1: Spruce Up your Bedroom with New Bed Linen</u>

      </p>
      <p>You can say goodbye to tossing and turning during the summer months, especially with some <a href="https://www.spotlightstores.com/bed/bed-linen">new bed linen</a>. Pack away your flannelette and polyester bed linen for next winter. Natural fabrics like cotton breathe better, a much-needed quality during the summer months.</p>
      <p>In summer, it’s time to move away from dark colours. Think fresh summer colours, bright florals and vibrant patterns to brighten up your bedroom. For a coastal inspired summer feel, choose blue, green or white bed linen. The finishing touch for your bedroom is to get a summer inspired coverlet. From calm whites and nautical inspired patterns, to bright patterns and pretty flowers. It is a simple way to refresh your bedroom for summer.</p>

      </p>
      <p>It’s easy to transform the look of a room by changing your curtains and blinds.  Add a touch of summer to your home with fresh white blinds that still allow natural light to filter through, bamboo roll up blinds for that modern Scandinavian look, or our favourite, neutral sun out blinds.</p>
      <p>Sunout roller blinds will keep that harsh summer sun out, protect the family from glare and even protect the furniture from fading.  They also help keep the warmth in when winter rolls back around so they’re perfect for year round functionality.</p>
