          <p>Despite having lost just the one time in their seven fixtures, Germany make a foray into the fray of today’s encounter yet to assure themselves of top spot in Group C. With second placed Netherlands persistently snapping at their heels, Germany know they need a draw at the bare least to wrap up a place in the pinnacles of the group, a gripping narrative which adds to the intrigue of an encounter which has no larger ramifications.</p>
          <p>Where Germany have assured themselves of qualification from the group, Northern Ireland on the other hand have no chances of qualifying through to Euro 2020 atleast from this round of qualifiers. The side floundered after winning four matches in succession to slump into third place with the four win, one draw and two defeats seeing them garner 13 points till now.</p>

                <p>However, things are far for done for the outfit with the side to play a set of deciding matches after this stage comes to an end. They’ll be looking to get preparations underway for that round starting today against a German opponent who’ll offer them a stern test, a side against whom Northern Ireland will be looking to emulate the same perseverance as they did against Netherlands.</p>
                <p>The side’s resolve and resolute brand of football had seen them restrict Netherlands to a -0 shut down in their foregone encounter, a result which did a massive favour to Germany as well. With Germany winning 4-0 against Belarus on the other hand, the side sit in a favourable position, one they’ll be looking to build on from and assure themselves of first position in the group when these two outfits clash heads today.</p>

                            <h3>GER Vs NIR Dream11 Goal-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>A reason for Northern Ireland managing to keep a cleansheet in their last outing against Netherlands was due to their astute goal-keeper Bailey Peacock-Farrell with the shot stopper pulling off a slew of saves in that encounter. It saw the side emerge unscathed from that tie, seeing us move in for the goal-keeper for today’s encounter given the slew of saves he promises to herald our way.</p>
                            <h3>GER Vs NIR Dream11 Defenders</h3>
                            <p>Having let in a mere 6 goals and up against a side who have mustered up a meagre 8 goals in seven matches, this is a clash where the writing on the wall of a German cleansheet looks extremely plausible. The side should manage to prevail today and imbed in place a shut down in this tie, seeing us move in with all the players from the side in this docket of our Dream 11 setup.</p>
                            <p>We will be moving in with the entire backline from the unit in the form of Nico Schulz, Robin Koch, Lukas Klostermann and Matthias Ginter, players not only capable of keeping a cleansheet but also cantering down the park and emerging with either a goal or assist in between them.</p>
                            <h3>GER Vs NIR Dream11 Midfielders</h3>
                            <p>Although Joshua Kimmich has been escalated to Germany’s midfield, the player continues to be asked to dole out a brunt of his defensive duties. It makes him a pristine option for this encounter, a player who will not only gallop down the park in a bid to provide assistance to his forward moving performers but also play a hefty role in his side’s defence by coming up with tackles and blocks.</p>
                            <p>We are also opting for Leon Goretzka from the side while from Northern Ireland we have decided to venture in with the two players as well in the form of Paddy McNair and Gavin Whyte. The two will be asked to express themselves feely in a match which won’t bear any ramifications on the larger scenario of the group, something which should see the visiting side come hot out of the blocks in this one.</p>
                            <h3>GER Vs NIR Dream11 Strikers</h3>
                            <p>With 11 goals for Germany, we are opting for Timo Werner from the home setup with the striker having been handed over the main duties of holding fort in his side’s attacking sorties. The striker has been in enterprising and imperious touch off late, traversing past defences to make him an instant pick for the day while from the other side we have the one player coming in as well in the form of Josh Magennis.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>We have selected Werner as our unit’s captain for this one whilst Kimmich will be our vice-captain.</p>
