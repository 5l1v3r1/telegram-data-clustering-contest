      <p>With an 8-2 record, the Seahawks are in great shape for an NFC playoff berth. They return to work this week, following the bye, off their biggest win of the season last Monday — a dramatic victory over the rival 49ers. The chips seem to be falling into place for Seattle, at just the right time.</p>
      <p>But this past weekend, at the least, was a small hiccup to its recent good fortune.</p>
      <p>The biggest bummer from Sunday’s games, from the Seahawks’ perspective: The Niners’ victory over the Cardinals. San Francisco overcame a 16-0 deficit to beat Arizona 36-26, improving to 9-1 and moving a full game ahead of Seattle in the NFC West race in the process. A 49ers’ loss would’ve pushed the Seahawks into first place in the division (The teams would have identical 8-2 records in the scenario of a 49ers’ loss Sunday, but the Seahawks own the tiebreaker because of their Week 10 in San Francisco).</p>
      <p>Three other teams the Seahawks would’ve been happy to see lose — the Saints, Vikings and Rams — won, too. The Saints beat the Bucs, maintaining the tiebreaker over Seattle. Minnesota, who the Seahawks play next week, kept its strong positioning in the playoff picture with a comeback victory against the Broncos. And the divisional-rival Rams essentially kept themselves alive in the Wild Card hunt by defeating the Bears on Sunday.</p>
      <p>If the playoffs started today, the Seahawks would be the No. 5 seed in the NFC — the top Wild Card spot. They’d face the Dallas Cowboys in the 4-5 matchup — like last season — and a win would give them a date against the Niners or the Packers on the road in the divisional round..</p>
      <p>NFC PLAYOFF PICTURE ENTERING WEEK 12:</p>
      <p>No. 1 seed: 9-1 Niners (West division)</p>
      <p>No. 2: 8-2 Packers (North)</p>
      <p>No. 3: 8-2 Saints (South)</p>
      <p>No. 4: 6-4 Cowboys (East)</p>
      <p>Wild Card teams</p>
      <p>No. 5: 8-2 Seahawks</p>
      <p>No. 6: 8-3 Vikings</p>
      <p>While the Seahawks couldn’t overtake the Niners for the NFC West’s top this weekend, they’re still in prime position to do so. The simplest way (and the most difficult)? Running the table. If Seattle won out the rest of the season, it would earn the first-round bye. That scenario would give the Seahawks two victories over San Francisco — the teams meet again in Week 17 — so even if the latter finished with an identical 14-2 record, Seattle would still have the edge due to the tiebreaker.</p>
      <p>Even if that situation is unlikely, the scheduling gods, at the least, are in the Seahawks’ favor. The Niners have the toughest remaining schedule in the NFL, with their last six regular-season opponents combining for a 41-19 record (.683 winning percentage). That stretch includes three tough road games: against the 8-2 Ravens, the 8-2 Saints and the 8-2 Seahawks.</p>
      <p>Seattle, on the other hand, has a more manageable schedule. Its remaining opponents have a record of 36-25-1. Three of the Seahawks’ remaining six opponents are .500 or worse, including their opponent this Sunday: the Eagles (5-5).</p>
      <p>Moral of the story? Seattle has already earned its way into being in control of its destiny. But help (and flops) from the outside would be an added bonus for its cause in January.</p>
