      <p>Even as a boy, Dylan Thomas had a poet's eye for the world, and, like other boys (and girls), his world came to a special kind of life at Christmastime.</p>
      <p>His reminiscences of that time are brought to life in a theatrical adaptation of his essay <b>"A Child's Christmas in Wales,"</b> opening at 7:30 p.m. Nov. 22 in Irish Classical Theatre Company. Vincent O'Neill leads the cast as the adult Dylan Thomas with Tyler Eisenmann, 14, making his ICTC debut as Young Dylan.</p>
      <p>Music will be provided by the Albrights as they hark back to the sea town where the young Dylan first heard "the distant speaking of the voices I sometimes hear a moment before sleep." Chris Kelly directs and Joseph Donohue III is music director and also plays Jim.</p>
      <p>Performances continue through Dec. 15 in ICTC's Andrews Theatre (625 Main St.). Tickets are $49 (<a href="https://irishclassical.com/a-childs-christmas-in-wales-opens-friday-november-22/">irishclassical.com).</a></p>
      <p>Another nostalgic production also opens Nov. 22 in the Lancaster Opera House, which is presenting <b>"Miracle on 34th Street: A Live Musical Radio Play"</b> for the holidays. The show is an adaptation of a 1947 radio broadcast of the story of a department story Santa Claus whose claim that he is the real thing winds up in court. The show is set in an old-time radio station and features sound effects and new musical numbers.</p>
      <p>The show runs through Dec. 8 in the Lancaster Opera House (21 Central Ave., Lancaster). Tickets are $32 general, $30 for seniors, $20 for students (<a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=lancaster+opera+house&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8">lancasteropera.org).</a></p>
