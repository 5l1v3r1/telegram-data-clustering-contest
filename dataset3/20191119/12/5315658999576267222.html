      <p>Simon Bridges - Leader of the Opposition</p>
      <p>19 November 2019</p>
      <p>A $40 million payment from the Crown to purchase Ihumātao will open up full and final treaty settlements, Leader of the Opposition Simon Bridges says.</p>
      <p>“Iwi lawyers will be writing their statements of claim for the court as we speak and protestors will be looking for their next site.</p>
      <p>“This is an appalling use of taxpayers’ money and the Government needs to rule it out.</p>
      <p>“The Prime Minister should never have become involved in the first place.</p>
      <p>“This shows a complete disregard for private property rights.</p>
      <p>“It’s been four months since the Prime Minister got involved. It’s time to finally put a stop to this. The protestors need to go home and the Government needs to rule out a loan.”</p>
