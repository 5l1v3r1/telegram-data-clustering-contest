      <h1>Club Players Association pull out of Fixtures Calendar Review Task Force committee</h1>
      <h2>Frustrated CPA bosses have this morning labelled the committee as a 'Trojan Horse' that will only 'ratify the status quo'</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:16:11+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/pat-nolan/" target="_blank">Pat Nolan</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/club-players-association">Club Players Association</a> has pulled out from the Fixtures Calendar Review Task Force committee.</p>
      <p>Frustrated CPA bosses have this morning labelled the committee as a 'Trojan Horse' that will only 'ratify the status quo'.</p>
      <p>The club players' representatives, through secretary Michael Higgins, emailed Fixtures Calendar Review task force chairman Eddie O'Sullivan yesterday to confirm the decision.</p>
      <p> "The CPA was the only member of the group to develop further plans during the process, responding to feedback in good faith," read a statement from CPA president Michael Briody that was distributed to media this morning. </p>
      <p>"While not perfect, we believe these two plans are superior to any currently being advocated by the task force. </p>
      <p>"We hoped at least one would be adopted into the final report but when we asked for a vote on November 6 to measure support, we were refused. </p>
      <p>"This is not a matter of sour grapes but illustrates in our view a reluctance to take on board differing views.</p>
      <p>"Our mantra has been 'it is not who is right but what is right for the Association."</p>
      <p>That letter, signed off by CPA secretary Michael Higgins, states that they entered the process "in good faith, in the hope that nothing was off the table," added Briody.</p>

      <p>"With the publication of the report due to be sent to Central Council shortly, we cannot in good conscience put our names to such a compromised document.</p>
      <p>"We are disappointed that the Task Force will not deliver the proposed options that the membership deserves to debate and vote upon.</p>
      <p>"The CPA will not be an accomplice to the entrenchment of the status quo.</p>
      <p>"We felt it was the best option for our membership to reveal the efforts that we made and explain the intricate workings of the Task Force.</p>
      <p>"The membership has been inundated with rhetoric in 2019 of 'Where We All Belong' at the same time as our Association is fast becoming an organization who no longer prioritises the Association as a community based Gaelic Games and Culture organisation with the club and the club player at its core. </p>
      <p>"Unfortunately, there is a clear and growing disconnect between the leadership of the GAA and their grassroots members.  </p>
      <p>"The reality is one of players voting with their feet and deciding that they do not all belong with their clubs and their teammates. </p>
      <p>"The Taskforce will report in due course and players, members, coaches and administrators can decide for themselves if the results and the proposals are the best that the GAA can come up with for the future of our games.</p>

      <p>"We in the CPA strongly believe this not to be the case."</p>
      <p>The CPA was established three years ago with a mission statement to 'fix the fixtures' and was formed as a reflection of the 'frustration...and disenchantment' of club players countrywide.</p>
      <p>Briody added: "We strongly pushed for an independent chairman (of the fixtures committee) that was ‘of the GAA’ but ‘not from the GAA’. </p>
      <p>"And we specifically did not think it would be a good idea to have people involved who would be defensive and protective of decisions that were made previously."</p>
      <p>The CPA put forward three names to act as an independent chairman.</p>
      <p>Briody noted that GAA president John Horan chose otherwise - and the players body was disappointed that a sports science expert wasn't added to the committee.</p>
      <p>"Whilst disappointed that there were so many insiders on the Task Force our executive voted to proceed to engage with the Task Force in good faith', added Briody.   </p>
      <p>"The establishment of the Fixtures Review Group presented the GAA with an unprecedented opportunity to Fix the Fixtures; to address the biggest concern among GAA players throughout the country; to put in place a programme that reflects the reality that our players face. </p>
      <p>"As it stands, we are bitterly disappointed and frustrated that this is an opportunity missed and that the GAA membership faces the real prospect of proposals coming forward to Congress that fall short of expectations and do not address the concerns of players and their teams as expressed in our core objectives.</p>
      <p>"We don’t want to outline a chronological history of all the Task Force meetings that happened from June to last week here today. </p>
      <p>"It would not be fair to members of the Task Force to highlight comments or debate at the meetings so we want to maintain that respect and confidentiality. </p>
      <p>"And we must point out that in fairness, there were some very measured and informed debates on quite a lot of topics. </p>
      <p>"But we want to point out the following as summary of our views".</p>
      <p>The statement outlined those views, as follows: </p>
      <p>• The Task Force needed to adopt Fixture Making Principles from the outset. This was not done until early November and no plan has ever been measured against the Principles.</p>
      <p>• The Taskforce spent the first couple of months hearing submissions from other groups, without ever getting into meaningful discussions on them. The submissions had real merit and were deserving of proper consideration. Taskforce members were then sent an email on August 1st suggesting three “broad options” for consideration. In the same email, the members were asked to review the submissions from the general public. Despite our best efforts, the three “broad options” suggested on August 1st dominated subsequent discussions. This not only made a mockery of asking the public for their opinion but it also contradicted the notion that “everything was on the table”.</p>
      <p>• Our contention is that the Taskforce is a ‘Trojan Horse’, designed to give cover to the GAA authorities to ratify the Status Quo, while having the appearance of consultation and thoughtful deliberation. In reality, it will simply be a ratification process for the newly introduced Tier Two football championship and retention of the Super 8s. Proposals that stand the best chance of getting through the decision making process at Congress, are not the same thing as the best proposals for the future of the GAA.</p>
      <p>• The Taskforce made a conscious decision not to adjust the Hurling structures. While making some small suggestions, the CPA was initially supportive of this approach, as we felt the Taskforce could offer better overall balance if the football championship was properly addressed. However, as this will not happen, it is now obvious to us that rubberstamping the new football championship was the priority of the Taskforce all along.</p>
      <p>• The CPA put forward concrete Fixture Plans at the start of the process, which were not entertained. And the CPA was the only member of the group to develop further plans during the process, responding to feedback in good faith. While not perfect, we believe these two plans are superior to any currently being advocated by the Taskforce. We hoped at least one would be adopted into the final report but when we asked for a vote on November 6th to measure support, we were refused. [This submission will be made available.} This is not a matter of sour grapes but illustrates in our view a reluctance to take on board differing views. Our mantra has been it is not who is right but what is right for the Association.</p>
