        <b>A new canopy design has been unveiled at Preston Market Hall to help protect traders and shoppers from the venue's freezing winter temperatures.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Preston City Council has temporarily installed a prototype section of the proposed canopy, which is designed to improve conditions in the Market Hall when it is completed next year.</p>

      <p>Made from steel frames and filled with clear plastic panels, the new canopy is designed to reduce draught which led to uncomfortable conditions for traders and shoppers last winter.</p>
      <p>The Council said the new structure will sit above the internal walkways between stalls, and will preserve the traditional appearance of the underside of the original 1875 canopy.</p>
      <p>The prototype is situated in the north west corner of the Market Hall, close to Brew + Bake cafe and Pickles of Preston.</p>
      <p>The Council has not provided an estimated completion date, but said timescales for the project are currently being planned with tenants.</p>

      <p>But the Council said work on the new canopy is expected to begin soon.</p>
      <p>Traders have complained of freezing temperatures in the multi-million pound facility since it reopened in February 2018.</p>
      <p>The draughty glass building, which cost the Council £3million, has even been nicknamed "The Ice Cube” among stall holders.</p>
      <p>Last year, the Council installed two sets of automatic sliding doors on the breezy western side of the market – opposite the top of Orchard Street – to block off the draughts.</p>

      <p>Funding for the new canopy was agreed by Preston City Council on August 22, as part of a major capital investment scheme to improve conditions in the Market Hall.</p>
      <p>Sam Livesey, chairman of the Traders Association at Preston Markets said: "This prototype is a good first step in the Council’s solution to the current conditions in the Market Hall.</p>
      <p>"The traders will be working with the council to decide an installation plan that will cause the least disruption, while installing the new canopies as quickly as possible."</p>

      <p>Neil Fairhurst, deputy chief executive at Preston City Council added: "This is another step forward for the improvements agreed at Council for the Market Hall.</p>
      <p>"Preston Markets is full of excellent products and we need Prestonians to support these local businesses and enjoy what Preston Markets has to offer especially over the upcoming festive period."</p>
