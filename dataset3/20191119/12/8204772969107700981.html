      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Kieran+Marmion">Kieran Marmion</a> has signed a new contract with <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Connacht">Connacht</a> until 2023, ending any speculation over the Ireland scrumhalf’s future.</p>
      <p>27-year-old Marmion missed out on Ireland’s Rugby World Cup squad and had been linked to a move away from Galway, with Saracens among his reported potential suitors.</p>
      <p>However he has committed his future to The Sportsground, agreeing a three-year contract extension with the province.</p>
      <p>Academy graduate Marmion has been capped 27 times for Ireland since making his debut against Argentina in 2014, and Connacht boss <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Andy+Friend">Andy Friend</a> believes retaining his services is a big boost for the province.</p>
      <p>He said: “Kieran has been an outstanding player for Connacht and for Ireland. He is a diligent professional and through his hard work he has progressed through the Connacht Academy and on to play for Ireland.</p>
      <p>“His progress demonstrates the support that is available to players through our academy pathway. Kieran’s commitment to Connacht for a further three seasons demonstrates his ambition to contribute at provincial and international level in the coming years.</p>
      <p>“His signing also ensures that we continue to retain a squad equipped to compete at the highest level of European club rugby”.</p>
