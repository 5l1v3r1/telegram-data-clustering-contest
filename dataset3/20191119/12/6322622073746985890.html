      <p>(Nov 19): Most Southeast Asian stock markets recouped losses from earlier in the session on Tuesday, with Singapore falling over 0.6%, although mixed signals from Washington and Beijing on trade talks capped gains.</p>
      <p>The Trump administration decided to grant a new extension which allowed U.S. companies to continue doing business with China's Huawei, stoking hopes of a truce.</p>
      <p>However, <i>CNBC</i> reported overnight that China was "pessimistic" about a trade agreement because of U.S. President Donald Trump's reluctance to roll back tariffs.</p>
      <p>"The trade-talks are starting to look more like an iceberg, and not a lighthouse," Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst for Asia Pacific at OANDA said in a note.</p>
      <p>Singapore stocks fell 0.7% to hit a near 3-week low.</p>
      <p>Index heavyweights Jardine Matheson Holdings and Jardine Strategic Holdings shed 1.8% each.</p>
      <p>The Philippines benchmark snapped four straight sessions of losses to end 0.4% higher. Power retailer Aboitiz Power Corp added 2.4%, while telco Globe Telecom gained 0.9%.</p>
      <p>Indonesian shares rose 0.48%, buoyed by financials.</p>
      <p>Shares of PT Bank Central Asia rose 0.6%, while PT Bank Mandiri (Persero) added 2.5%, both hitting their highest level in nearly two weeks.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Malaysian equities recovered from losses suffered earlier in the session to end flat.</p>
      <p>The index had fallen as much as 0.6% earlier, after a minister said that the country would enforce new food safety regulations under consideration by the European Union on palm oil by 2021.</p>
      <p>Palm oil growers faced added challenges, with government officials also saying they would mandate the palm oil industry to meet certain workers' rights and environmental protection standards by 2020.</p>
      <p>Losses suffered by palm oil cultivators like PPB Group and Hap Seng Consolidated were offset by gains by financial stocks such as Public Bank and Hong Leong Bank.</p>
      <p>Vietnamese equities tacked on 0.6%, lifted by financial stocks.</p>
