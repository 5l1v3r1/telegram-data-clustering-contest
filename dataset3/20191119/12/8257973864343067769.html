      <h1>Airlines order 60 737 Max airliners from Boeing at Dubai show</h1>

      <p>Nov. 19 (UPI) -- Boeing said Tuesday it has received orders for 60 of its 737 Max aircraft, despite the fact they are still not yet allowed to fly worldwide.</p>
      <p>Kazakhstan carrier Air Astana issued a letter of intent to buy 30 Max jets for its new low-cost airline FlyAstan, Boeing <a href="https://boeing.mediaroom.com/2019-11-19-Boeing-Air-Astana-Announce-Intent-To-Buy-30-737-MAX-Airplanes">said</a>. The $3.6 billion sale is contingent on the aircraft passing regulatory hurdles and returning to service.</p>
      <p>"Since its launch in May this year, FlyAstan has exceeded all expectations and it is clear that low cost air travel has a great future in Kazakhstan and Central Asia," Air Astana President and CEO Peter Foster said in a statement. "We believe that the Max will provide a solid platform for the growth of FlyAstan throughout our region once the aircraft has successfully returned to service."</p>
      <p>Boeing said it has also received a $1.2 billion order for 10 Max airliners from Turkish leisure airline SunExpress, in addition 32 previously ordered. Boeing received another order for 20 from a mystery buyer.</p>
      <p>The 737 Max has been grounded since March as Boeing works on a fix to its automated flight system, which is responsible for two crashes overseas that killed nearly 350 passengers and crew. U.S. regulators still need to sign off on the repair.</p>
      <p>The operators of Max jetliners in the United States -- United, Southwest and American -- have removed the plane from their flight schedules until at least March.</p>
      <p>British Airways said in June it intends to buy 200 Max models, but the order hasn't been finalized. Rival Airbus secured $30 billion in orders at the Dubai Air Show, including 120 A320 neeo jets from Air Arabia and 50 A350 XWBs from Emirates on <a href="https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2019/11/18/Emirates-to-spend-16-billion-for-50-of-Airbus-new-A350-XWB/8381574083614/?upi_ss=airbus">Monday</a>.</p>
