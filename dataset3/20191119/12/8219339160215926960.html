      <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/airpods-stickers-prank-san-francisco-2019-11?r=US&amp;IR=T"><i>Business Insider</i></a> explains.</p>
      <blockquote>An artist carried out a prank this weekend that was seemingly designed to make Apple fans’ blood pressure spike.<br/><br/>Pablo Rochat […] printed out dozens of life-sized stickers designed to look like Airpods and stuck them to the ground all over the city.<br/><br/>The prank was primarily intended to catch people’s attention and cause them to do a double-take, Rochat told Business Insider.<br/><br/>“Most people found it funny, but a few people were pissed that they got pranked,” Rochat said.</blockquote>
