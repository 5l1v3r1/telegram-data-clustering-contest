      <p><b>Manchester United starlet Tahith Chong is reportedly looking for a ‘new adventure’ away from Old Trafford</b>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/tag/tahith-chong"><b>Chong</b></a> has entered the final year of his contract at Old Trafford and so far there have been no confirmed noises about a new deal coming from the Red Devils, <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/chong-responds-to-man-utd-contract-rumours-as-he-offers-latest-from-club"><b>despite the player admitting the opposite</b></a>.</p>
      <p>The <i>Daily Mail</i> reported earlier this month that Juventus were keeping tabs on the 19-year-old, who predominantly plays as a winger at United.</p>
      <p>Any potential move to Juve will provide United fans with flashbacks to when they let Paul Pogba move to Turin for free in 2012 before signing him back for £89million only four years later.</p>
      <p>And now <i>Corriere dello Sport</i> (via <i>Sport Witness</i>) claims that Chong’s representatives feel the Dutchman has ‘not been used enough’ this term.</p>

      <p>The report adds that they have ‘unsurprisingly started looking around in search of a new adventure’ and are keen to find a club that would ‘help him become a great’.</p>
      <p>The report adds that Chong is keen on a potential switch to Juventus and that talks have already taken place between the clubs.</p>
      <p>However, it’s claimed that Juve are no the only club keen on Chong and that despite their silence so far, United are still looking to offer the talented youngster a new contract.</p>
