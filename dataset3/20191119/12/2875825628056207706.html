      <h1>Kieran Marmion commits future to Connacht ahead of Toulouse Champions Cup clash</h1>
      <h2>Marmion was linked with a move to Saracens but has instead signed a new three-year deal with Connacht</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:13:16+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/michael-scully/" target="_blank">Michael Scully</a></address>
      <p>Kieran Marmion has decided to commit his future to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/connacht-rugby">Connacht</a> in a boost to the province ahead of their big Champions Cup clash in Toulouse this weekend.</p>
      <p>Marmion, 27, was linked with a move to Saracens but has instead signed a new three-year deal with the westerners that keeps him at the Sportsground until the end of the 2022/23 campaign.</p>
      <p>The scrum-half has been with Connacht since joining the Academy eight years ago and has clocked up over 160 appearances for the province.</p>
      <p>But he was heartbroken to miss out on Ireland's World Cup squad for the second time in four years when he failed to make the final cut for Japan.</p>
      <p>Connacht Head Coach Andy Friend commented: “Kieran has been an outstanding player for Connacht and for Ireland.</p>
      <p>"He is a diligent professional and through his hard work he has progressed through the Connacht Academy and on to play for Ireland.</p>
      <p>"His progress demonstrates the support that is available to players through our academy pathway. Kieran’s commitment to Connacht for a further three seasons demonstrates his ambition to contribute at provincial and international level in the coming years.</p>
      <p>"His signing also ensures that we continue to retain a squad equipped to compete at the highest level of European club rugby”.</p>
