        <b>Hillary Clinton’s name is pure poison and no one in their right mind wants anything to do with her.</b>
      </p>
      <p>This is evidenced nowhere more in the fact that the Clinton Foundation has gone from turning over a revenue of almost $400 million in 2013, to actually LOSING almost $33 million since Donald Trump wiped the floor with Hillary in 2016.</p>
      <p>Newly released <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6549930-Clinton-Foundation-2018-990.html">tax records</a> show that the foundation reported a loss of almost $17 million in 2018, to add to the net loss of $16.1 million the previous year in 2017.</p>
      <p>The numbers don’t lie.</p>
      <p>Total revenue reported for 2018 was just $30.7 million, less than a tenth of what was being pulled in While Hillary was Secretary of State.</p>
      <p>Only $24.2 million was posted in grants and contributions, which constitutes a record low for the “charity.” Expenses amounted to $47.5 million, hence a loss of $16.8 million.</p>
      <p>In 2009, the Clinton Foundation hauled in $249 million, and in the four years that followed, another $392.2 million in revenue poured in. In her last three years in office, 2014-16, the foundation raised a whopping $344.4 million.</p>
      <p>In total, during the eight years of Obama’s presidency, the Clinton Foundation reported total revenue of more than $1.1 billion</p>
      <p>Then Hillary coughed and collapsed her way to the election, and America was ‘made great again’,</p>
      <p>We learned about hammers and hard drives, and a many of the Clintons’ donors realised that the optics of giving money to a ‘crooked’ family are not good.</p>
      <p>It seems there is only one thing left for Hillary to do…</p>
