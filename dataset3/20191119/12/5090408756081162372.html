      <h1>Neil Cavuto scolded Trump over attack on Cavuto's Fox News colleague Chris Wallace, who the president called 'nasty' and 'obnoxious', Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:08:30+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:08</time> by <a rel="author">Bill Bostock, Business Insider US</a></address>

        <li>The Fox News host Neil Cavuto admonished US President Donald Trump on Monday for personally attacking Cavuto’s colleague Chris Wallace.</li>
        <li>Trump called Wallace “nasty &amp; obnoxious” after he pushed back on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-bashes-chris-wallace-new-fox-news-steve-scalise-interview-2019-11?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T">Rep. Steve Scalise’s</a> attempt to discredit impeachment inquiry witnesses during Wallace’s show on Sunday.</li>
        <li>Cavuto defended Wallace’s approach, saying: “We can’t please all. The best we could do as journalists is to be fair to all, including you, Mr. President. That’s not fake doing that.”</li>
        <li>Cavuto said Trump “doesn’t distinguish” between false news and unflattering fact-based press.</li>
        <li>The spat is the latest in recent months between Trump and hosts on Fox News, where he expects universally favorable coverage.</li>

      <p>The Fox News anchor Neil Cavuto scolded President Donald Trump on Monday <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-bashes-chris-wallace-new-fox-news-steve-scalise-interview-2019-11?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T">for attacking Cavuto’s colleague</a> Chris Wallace.</p>
      <p>“While it’s understandable not to like what you hear, Mr. President, it is not understandable to tune out what you should otherwise like very much to hear,” Cavuto said during his Common Sense monologue on “Your World.”</p>
      <p>Trump on Sunday had <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-bashes-chris-wallace-new-fox-news-steve-scalise-interview-2019-11?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T">rushed to defend Republican Rep. Steve Scalise</a>, who Wallace had doggedly questioned in an interview about the witnesses testifying for the House impeachment inquiry.</p>
      <p>Trump called the interview, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-bashes-chris-wallace-new-fox-news-steve-scalise-interview-2019-11?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T">in which Scalise sought to discredit the witnesses</a>, “dumb and unfair” and Wallace “nasty &amp; obnoxious.”</p>

      <p>Cavuto said on his show that Trump “doesn’t distinguish” between false news and unflattering fact-based press.</p>
      <p>“What makes something fake news?” he said to open the segment. “I would assume if the news being reported is fake or wrong and the person presenting that news knows it is fake or wrong, that is bad. But what if the news being reported is accurate?”</p>
      <p>He added: “Scalise has steadfastly defended the president on this whole Ukrainian situation. The president likes Steve for that. Let’s just say he doesn’t like Chris for challenging Scalise on that.”</p>

      <p>Trump has come to expect favorable coverage from Fox News, and while he still largely gets it from the network’s opinion hosts, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-continues-fox-news-war-chris-wallace-ukraine-coverage-father-2019-10">he has taken issue multiple times in recent months with the network’s coverage of his administration</a>, complaining that it is “much different” from what it used to be.</p>
      <p>As <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-bashes-chris-wallace-new-fox-news-steve-scalise-interview-2019-11?r=US&amp;amp;IR=T">Business Insider’s Kat Tenbarge reported</a>, Wallace pushed back during Sunday’s interview when Scalise sought to discredit those who had testified in House Democrats’ impeachment inquiry.</p>
      <p>“Well, those were Schiff’s witnesses,” Scalise said, referring to Rep. Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, after Wallace said that numerous US officials who had listened in on Trump’s July 25 phone call that sparked the inquiry were “immediately upset” by what Trump said.</p>
      <p>“No, sir, they’re career foreign-service officers and these are people who work in the Trump administration,” Wallace said, noting that Vice President Mike Pence’s aide Jennifer Williams said in her <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/16/779946508/read-testimony-of-jennifer-williams-aide-to-vice-president-pence">closed-door deposition</a>, released Saturday, that the conversation was “inappropriate.”</p>
      <p>“We can’t please all,” Cavuto said on his show Monday. “The best we could do as journalists is be fair to all, including you, Mr. President. That’s not fake doing that. What is fake is not doing that. What is fake is saying Fox never used to do that. Mr. President, we have always done that. We did. Chris did. I know I did.”</p>
