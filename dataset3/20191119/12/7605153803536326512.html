        <b>BUJUMBURA, Burundi, Nov 19 – Burundian soldiers were attacked in a night jungle ambush near the border with Rwanda, Burundi’s defence ministry said, with military sources on Tuesday reporting at least eight soldiers’ deaths.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Dozens more soldiers were missing in the ambush on their base, one of largest and deadliest attacks for several years, senior army officers said Tuesday, speaking on condition of anonymity.</b>
      </p>

      <p>“A group armed with rifles from Rwanda attacked a position of Burundian soldiers on Mount Twinyoni,” defence ministry spokesman Major Emmanuel Gahongano said on state television on Monday. “This armed group has withdrawn to Rwanda.”</p>
      <p>He did not give details of casualties or the identity of the attackers.</p>
      <p>Burundi has been in crisis since President Pierre Nkurunziza defied constitutional limits to seek a third term in office, winning re-election in 2015.</p>
      <p>Burundi has repeatedly accused neighbouring Rwanda of supporting rebel groups in its territory, a claim Kigali denies.</p>
      <p>Rwanda on Tuesday denied any role in the attack.</p>
      <p>“It is not true that the attacks were made from people who came from Rwanda,” Olivier Nduhungirehe, State Minister for Regional Affairs, told AFP.</p>
      <p>“These are unfounded allegations being made from Burundi — as they have done previously for the last four years. We have other things to do.”</p>
      <p>The attack, some 100 kilometres (60 miles) north of the capital Bujumbura, in thick forests 10 kilometres from the Rwandan border, took place in the early hours of Sunday morning.</p>
      <p>Around 90 soldiers were reported to be in the base before the attack.</p>
      <p>But when reinforcements arrived hours later, they found only the bodies of eight comrades, including of the company commander, a senior officer told AFP.</p>
      <p>Later, 15 soldiers were found alive, some of them wounded.</p>
      <p>“The rest of the company is still missing,” the officer said. Their fate is unknown.</p>
      <p>The military source reported that attackers were well-equipped.</p>
      <p>“Our soldiers were surprised by assailants wearing bullet-proof vests and night-vision goggles, which completely wiped out the position,” the officer said, a report confirmed by two other military sources.</p>
      <p>“We believe that it is not mere rebels who are responsible for it.”</p>
      <p>No Burundian armed group has claimed responsibility.</p>
