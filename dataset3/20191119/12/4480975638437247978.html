      <h1>Gold price news &amp; forecast: XAU/USD Once again fails near $1475 level</h1>

      <h3>XAU/USD Once again fails near $1475 level</h3>
      <p>Gold failed to capitalize on its early uptick to over one-week tops and once again started retreating from the $1475 <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance">resistance</a> zone. Currently hovering around the $1466 region, the commodity has now erased all of the previous session's modest intraday gains.</p>
      <p>The mentioned barrier represents a previous horizontal support breakpoint and the lower end of a one-month-old trading range, which is closely followed by 100-day SMA and should act as a key pivotal point for the commodity's next leg of a directional move. <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/news/gold-technical-analysis-once-again-fails-near-1475-level-previous-support-turned-resistance-201911191023">Read more...</a></p>

      <h4>Gold: bulls need a decisive pop above $1494</h4>
      <p>Following the downside break of $1458 key October low, gold has engaged in a mild unwinding drift back higher. We continue to see this move will be the source of the next chance to sell. There is resistance of overhead supply $1474/$1480 which is now being tested. Another failure around here could be the trigger signal. </p>
      <p>The RSI failing around 45/50 would be a negative signal now and already the Stochastics are looking tired in a rebound. The hourly chart shows a recovery has lost some of its impetus now and more neutral set up is beginning to develop across momentum indicators. Initial support of yesterday’s low at $1456 now protects $1445. The bulls need a decisive pop above $1494 to really suggest a sustaining recovery. <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/analysis/gold-bulls-need-a-decisive-pop-above-1494-video-201911191053">Read more...</a></p>
