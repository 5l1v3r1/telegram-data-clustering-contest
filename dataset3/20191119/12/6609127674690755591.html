        <b>VIRGIN Media broadband is down this morning with frustrated customers unable to get online.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Customers are also unable to check the My Virgin website for a service update due to "essential" maintenance work being done on the page.</p>

      <p>At 10am, outage tracker Downdetector reported almost 300 complaints from customers about their Virgin broadband.</p>
      <p>A map on the website appears to show reports of Virgin broadband being down in several areas of the UK.</p>
      <p>We've asked Virgin if it's aware of the issue and how many customers are affected and we'll update this story when we get a response.</p>
      <p>Irritated customers have been taking to Twitter to complain about their lack of service.</p>

      <p>One person said: "Internet gone off, can't access website or account because it says your website is down."</p>
      <p>Another customers tweeted: "This is ridiculous. Internet off. Service status page down.</p>
      <p>"I try calling and apparently the service is actually down ON PURPOSE for fictional ‘improvements’?</p>
      <p>"No service is NOT an improvement and we received no notice of this planned outage. Absolutely unacceptable."</p>
      <p>Someone else said: "What's happening with your internet service?</p>
      <p>"It's down more than it's working, are there problems in the neath area again?</p>
      <h3>Can I claim compensation if my network goes down?</h3>
      <p>
        <b>YOU may be able to claim compensation if you’re not getting the level of service that you have been promised, according to regulator <a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/phones-telecoms-and-internet/advice-for-consumers/problems/mobile-faults-guide">Ofcom</a>. </b>
      </p>
      <p>You will need to give your provider a "reasonable opportunity" to fix the issue before escalating your concerns though.</p>
      <p>Where repairs take much longer, for example it takes longer than usual to access a mast site, you may be entitled to a refund or compensation.</p>
      <p>If your provider fails to repair fault by a promised time, or you’re unhappy with how long it is taking to fix it, you should follow their formal complaints procedure.</p>
      <p>You will be able to find these on the provider's website or through their customer services team.</p>
      <p>If your problem is still unresolved after eight weeks, you can escalate it to an independent Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) scheme.</p>
      <p>To do that, you’ll need to ask your provider for a “deadlock” letter that you will have to show one of the two ADR schemes approved by the watchdog - <a href="http://www.cisas.org.uk/">CISAS</a> and <a href="http://www.ombudsman-services.org/communications.html">Ombudsman Services: Communications</a>.</p>
      <p>Your provider will be a member of at least one of them. You can find out which one by using the <a href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/phones-telecoms-and-internet/advice-for-consumers/problems/adr-schemes">ADR checker</a>.</p>

      <p>"Very frustrating paying for a service that does not work for half of the month."</p>
      <p>While another person asked: "Anyone having problems with Virgin Broadband in Basingstoke area this morning?"</p>
      <p>Virgin isn't the only network to have experienced issues this week.</p>
      <p>Yesterday saw Sky broadband leave<a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/money/4966502/sky-broadband-down-leaving-hundreds-of-customers-without-access-to-internet/"> hundreds of customers without access to internet</a> after a broken network card disrupted the network.</p>
      <p>Last week,<a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4920744/talktalk-down-as-customers-complain-of-broadband-internet-and-email-outage/"> TalkTalk customers were left without internet</a> after a problem with Openreach.</p>
      <p>Back in October thousands of <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4846169/three-mobile-down-mobile-network/">Three customers were unable to make calls or go online for hours.</a></p>
