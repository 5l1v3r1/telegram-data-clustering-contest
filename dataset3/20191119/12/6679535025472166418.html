      <p>At a press conference here on Tuesday, Ajith Pai, Member, Board of Director, TiE Mysuru said that the unique feature of forming TiE Angels is to enable growth of start-ups and to support entrepreneurs early. “TiE Angels is part of a larger network of TiE Global, and through this the start-ups will have the ability to raise funds from angel investors from across the country.”</p>

      <p>Pavan Ranga, Member, Board of Director, TiE Mysuru said that apart from interactions with angels and entrepreneurs, TiECON will provide a platform for start-ups to be part of “Pitch Room” where they can pitch their ideas. “This is a very useful stage for start-ups as many times, they face big challenge in raising funds,” he added.</p>

      <p>Sanjay Srinivasmurthy, President, TiE Mysuru, said that TiE is a catalyst for young entrepreneurs to seek timely guidance and mentorship from experienced charter member mentors and learn from their experiences. “TiECON Mysuru is an opportunity for aspiring entrepreneurs to explore and learn how the Indian ecosystem has matured and shaping up to build synergies that are critical to the start-ups’ success,” he added.</p>
      <p>TiE Mysuru was formed in 2018 with successful entrepreneurs in Mysore coming together.</p>
