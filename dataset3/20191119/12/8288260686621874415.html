      <h1>Conservatives set out plans to fight knife crime if they win general election</h1>
      <h2>Police will get new powers to stop and search known knife-carriers</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:13:26+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:13</time> by <a rel="author">Jonathan Walker, https://www.facebook.com/JonWalkerPolitics?pnref=story</a></address>
      <p>Reforms to police and the criminal justice system will ensure anyone caught carrying a knife illegally will be in court within a week, Conservative leader Boris Johnson pledges today.</p>
      <p>A Tory government will also give police new powers making it easier for police to stop and search known knife carriers.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson made the announcement alongside Home Secretary Priti Patel, who said: "There were more than 500 arrests for possession of weapons by West Midlands police last year, but there are still too many people on the streets carrying knives and devastating our communities."</p>
      <p>It comes after figures released under the Freedom of Information Act show that we are seeing 14 knife crimes a day on the streets West Midlands this year so far.</p>
      <p>West Midlands Police said that they had logged 22,825 crimes involving a knife or sharp instrument in the last five years - and 4,081 in 2019 so far. It means our streets are seeing 14 knife crimes a day this year.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Official figures published earlier this year showed West Midlands Police recorded 3,428 knife crimes in the 2018-19 financial year. This was the highest since comparable records began in 2010/11.</p>

      <p>The force covers Birmingham, Solihull, Coventry and the Black Country.</p>
      <p>The Conservative plans include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Anyone caught unlawfully with a knife will be immediately arrested, charged within 24 hours and in court within a week – three times faster than the current average.</li>
        <li>Police will be empowered to target known knife carriers with a new court order, making it easier for officers to stop and search those known in the past to have carried weapons.</li>
        <li>Violence reduction units - multi-agency teams made up of the police, social services and other agencies – will be boosted by £35 million next year to champion preventative work and stop violence from happening in the first place.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Mr Johnson said: "A majority Conservative government would come down hard on the scourge of knife crime.</p>
      <p>“We have committed to putting an extra 20,000 police officers on our streets, but they need to have the powers to act decisively and effectively to prevent crime and see that offenders face justice."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Under the Conservative plans, an extra 366 police officers in the West Midlands next year.</p>
      <p>However, Labour and other opposition parties point out that the 20,000 extra officers planned by the Conservatives will only make up for the police officer roles cut under the Tories since 2010 as a result of cuts in funding from central government.</p>
      <p>In one of the latest shocking crimes, <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/rip-young-man-tributes-victim-17272730">a man was stabbed to death in Lozells on Sunday</a> .</p>
      <p>The victim, who has not yet been named, was in his 20s and discovered with serious wounds just before 3.30pm in Lozells Street.</p>
      <p>He was confirmed dead before arriving at hospital and a 27-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder after a car was stopped on Alum Rock Road by firearms officers.</p>
