      <p>Two Limerick-based gardai are being treated in hospital after sustaining injuries when their patrol car was rammed during a pursuit of another car overnight.</p>
      <p>Two men were arrested by gardai in connection with the incident, and officers recovered a knife, suspected cannabis, and a car believed to have been involved.</p>
      <p>The incident began shortly before midnight when a garda patrol unit attempted to stop another car in the car park of the Crescent Shopping Centre in Doooradoyle, Limerick city.</p>
      <p>Gardai said the car took off at speed in the direction of the Ballykeefe Roundabout, and the pursuing garda patrol car were requested the assistance of the Armed Support Unit (ASU) and Roads Policing Unit (RPU) with both units joining the “managed pursuit”.</p>
      <p>The car rammed the RPU patrol car at the Clonmacken Roundabout, 6km away from where the purist began, and two gardai were injured and taken to University Hospital Limerick for non-life threatening injuries.</p>

      <p>The occupants of the car fled the vehicle on foot and were pursued on foot by gardai.</p>
      <p>Two men were arrested and gardai recovered a knife and €1500 worth of suspected cannabis, pending analysis, gardai said.</p>
      <p>The car involved in the pursuit was also seized and transported to a location where it will be further searched and forensically examined by gardai.</p>
      <p>A garda spokesman said: “Gardaí have arrested two men in their 20s and seized approximately €1500 of suspected cannabis and a knife following a managed pursuit in Limerick city.”</p>
      <p>“Shortly before midnight on the 18th November, Gardaí were on patrol when they attempted to stop a car in the Crescent Shopping Centre Car Park. When Gardaí approached the car it took off at speed towards Ballykeefe Roundabout.”</p>
      <p>“Gardaí from the Henry Street District and the Armed Support Unit pursued and at Clonmacken Roundabout the car rammed a Garda vehicle.”</p>

      <p>“The two men are currently detained under Section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984 at Roxboro Road and Henry Street Garda Stations.”</p>
