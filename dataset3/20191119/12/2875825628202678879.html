      <p>However, appearing on This Morning today, she revealed what was really going on.</p>
      <p>Confirming she had been back for a documentary marking the soap's 60th birthday, she said: "It's basically a load of us that have left and have done quite well, we were talking about our memories of the street and how that set our careers up.</p>

      <p>"So I did this little 10 minute interview, didn't think anything of it. Then the next minute I'm going back to the street. I was like, 'That's the first I've heard!'"</p>
      <p>Asked whether she would ever return, she said: "Oh gosh, I'd never say never. I loved it - it was brilliant, it still is brillaint."</p>

      <p>Her character Shelley was involved in a number of major storylines during her time on the cobbles, including a bigamous marriage to Peter Barlow and her abusive one with Charlie Stubbs, played by Bill Ward.</p>
      <p>Shelley was manipulated by Charlie throughout their relationship, with the builder cheating on her with her own mother Bev.</p>
      <p>She later dumped Charlie at the altar, but had a one night stand with him and got pregnant before leaving the cobbles.</p>
