      <p>Thugs suspected to be loyalists of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kogi State on Monday set on fire the women leader of the opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP).</p>
      <p>PDP Wada/Aro Campaign Council spokesman Faruk Adejoh-Audu made the disclosure in a statement.</p>
      <p>“The Woman Leader of Wada Aro Campaign Council, Ochadamu Ward, Hon Mrs Acheju Abuh was this afternoon burnt alive in her home by jubilant Bello supporters and thugs said to be celebrating his victory,” Adejoh-Audu said.</p>
      <p>The PDP spokesman said the thugs who were chanting GYB 4+4, arrived Hon (Mrs) Abuh’s house at about 2:00 pm shooting sporadically.</p>
      <p>He said the thugs surrounded the house and blocked every exit and escape route from outside.</p>
      <p>“They then poured petrol on the building and set it ablaze as other terrorized villagers watched from hiding.”</p>
      <p>She reportedly attempted to escape through a window but was prevented by the metal burglar proof and gunshots.</p>
      <p>Adejoh-Audu said the thugs waited and watched Mrs Abuh cried from inside the inferno until her voice died out.</p>
      <p>The thugs, Adejoh-Audu reportedly said, left only when the entire house and Mrs Abuh had been burnt to ashes.</p>
      <p>Adejoh-Audu said there is no indication that the Kogi State Police “will arrest her killers or even prevent further attacks and killings of our people.”</p>
      <p>The PDP spokesman called on the Inspector General of Police to rein on the suspected Bello’s thugs and protect the people of the state.</p>
