      <h1>Another senator seeks establishment of North Central Development Commission</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:13:53+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/regional/north-central/364074-another-senator-seeks-establishment-of-north-central-development-commission.html" target="_blank">QueenEsther Iroanusi</a></address>
      <p>The Senate has introduced a bill seeking the establishment of another regional development agency.</p>
      <p>The North Central Development Commission (Establishment) Bill, 2019 is sponsored by Niger East senator, Mohammed Sani. It was read for the first time on Tuesday during plenary.</p>
      <p>The new bill comes barely a week after the senate introduced a bill seeking the establishment of the South West Development Commission.</p>
      <p>Ibikunle Amosun (Ogun Central, APC) who sponsored the Bill, said it is for the development of the people and the South West region.</p>
      <p>Last week, the Senate also re-introduced a bill seeking to establish the South-East Development Commission (SEDC).</p>
      <p>The bill, which scaled first reading on the floor, was passed by the 8th Senate but failed to receive presidential assent.</p>
      <p>Already in existence is the <b><a href="http://nddc.gov.ng/">Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC)</a></b> and the North East Development Commission (NEDC), whose establishment bill received presidential assent in October, 2017.</p>
      <p>With the introduction of the North Central Development Commission (Establishment) Bill, 2019, it appears every region wants a commission.</p>
