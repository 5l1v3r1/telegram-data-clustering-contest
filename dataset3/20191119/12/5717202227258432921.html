      <p>The star has been used sparingly by Unai Emery this season, with Matteo Guendouzi and Granit Xhaka his go-to midfield pairing.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.calciomercato.com/news/bentancur-a-cm-milan-torreira-ecco-perche-non-e-andata-in-porto--25745">Speaking to Calciomercato</a>, Bentancur said: “I must say that the change of role has penalised him sharply. He is no longer at ease and we hope that things can change.”</p>
      <p>Bentancur also added that Torreira still follows Italian football with great interest – which comes after previous comments that there was interest in the summer from AC Milan.</p>

      <p>The £26 million signing from Sampdoria (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44764063">BBC Sport</a>) started off brilliantly for Arsenal following his 2018 transfer, but has tailed off for the Gunners this calendar year.</p>
      <p>And it appears now that he might not last much longer at the Emirates Stadium.</p>
      <h3>Arsenal fans react</h3>
      <p>Lots of Arsenal fans reacted with dismay on social media after catching wind of Bentancur’s comments:</p>
