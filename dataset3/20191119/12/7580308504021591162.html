      <p>China insisted Tuesday it alone held the authority to rule on constitutional matters in Hong Kong, as it condemned a decision by the city’s high court to overturn a ban on face masks worn by pro-democracy protesters.</p>
      <p>The statement raised hackles among activists in Hong Kong after months of violent protests over concerns that Beijing is chipping away at the autonomy of the financial hub.</p>
      <p>The ban on face-covering came into force in October, when the city’s unelected pro-Beijing leader invoked colonial-era legislation for the first time in more than 50 years.</p>
      <p>The move was seen as a watershed legal moment for the city since its 1997 return by Britain to China — but has been largely symbolic.</p>
      <p>The city’s high court ruled on Monday that the government ban on face masks was unconstitutional. But Beijing said the judicial branch of the special administrative region had overreached.</p>
      <p>Zang Tiewei, a spokesman of the National People’s Congress, said only the legislature had the right to rule on whether a law is in accordance with the Basic Law — the city’s mini-constitution.</p>
      <p>“No other institution has the right to make judgements or decisions,” Zang said, according to a state media report posted on the NPC’s website.</p>
      <p>He said the ruling had “severely weakened the governance” of Hong Kong chief executive Carrie Lam and the city government.</p>
      <p>Zang also indicated that the legislature might take some form of action.</p>
      <p>“We are considering the relevant opinions and suggestions put forward by some NPC deputies,” he said, without elaborating.</p>
      <p>Protests started in June as a peaceful condemnation of a now-shelved China extradition bill, but have morphed into a battle to defend unique freedoms unseen on the mainland, which include freedom of speech and an independent judiciary.</p>
      <p>Dennis Kwok, a pro-democracy lawmaker, warned that taking away the power of the courts in Hong Kong “will be the end of one country, two systems” — the policy that governs the city.</p>
      <p>“This is not a time to burn down your own house or to destroy the rule of law in Hong Kong,” Kwok said.</p>
      <p>“Respect the courts in Hong Kong, respect our system and this is the essence of the one country two systems.”</p>
      <p>On Twitter, democracy activist Joshua Wong saw the NPC statement as a warning that it would reinterpret Hong Kong’s constitution.</p>
      <p>“When the state loses, she changes the rules of game. Beijing never intends to play by the rules,” Wong said.</p>
      <p><b>‘Hong Kong’s thugs’ </b><br/>China has repeatedly warned that it would not allow the city to spiral into total chaos, fuelling concerns that Beijing might deploy troops to quell the unrest.</p>
      <p>China’s ambassador to Britain, Liu Xiaoming, warned on Monday that the central government would not sit idly by if the situation got out of control.</p>
      <p>“We have enough resolution and power to end the unrest,” Liu said.</p>
      <p>Beijing has so far backed Lam and the city’s police force.</p>
      <p>This week police laid siege at a university campus where protesters — some armed with bows and homemade catapults to fire bricks — were holed up.</p>
      <p>Dozens of exhausted pro-democracy protesters barricaded inside the Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) defied warnings to surrender on Tuesday after some escaped overnight by slithering down ropes from a footbridge.</p>
      <p>Chinese state media slammed the high court ruling.</p>
      <p>“This disappointing verdict will encourage radical protesters to do evil and discourage the police from curbing violence,” the nationalist Global Times said in an editorial.</p>
      <p>In a strident front-page commentary, the People’s Daily accused Western politicians of defending “violent crimes” and “anti-China forces” in Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>“Violent crime is not only a ‘virus’ that endangers Hong Kong society, but also a public enemy that endangers all mankind,” the Communist Party mouthpiece said.</p>
      <p>“The atrocities of Hong Kong’s thugs have gone beyond the bottom line of human morality and civilisation, and will not be allowed in any country or civilised society,” it said.</p>
