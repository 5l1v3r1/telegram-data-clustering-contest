      <h3><a href="https://www.nhsbt.nhs.uk/">NHS Blood and Transplant</a> have signed a deal with BT to improve its blood donor network through digital transformation</h3>
      <p>BT will be connecting the NHS Blood and Transplant’s fixed and mobile blood donor sites using its EE 4G network. This will allow teams to digitally manage blood donor and blood collection information remotely.</p>
      <p>NHS staff will be able to use the devices to record and update patient details, as well as track information on blood donation bookings and blood donor records. The devices include hand-held scanners to identify and capture data on the donor and the <a href="https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/umbilical-cord-blood-life-enhancer-babies/31716/">blood donation</a>, welcome device tablets to log information about the donors booking and laptops for data management.</p>
      <p>All data will be stored on a BT platform in the cloud which will be updated in real-time.</p>
      <p>Danny Longbottom, Director of Local Government and Health at BT, said: “The work of NHS Blood and Transplant is integral to the NHS. We’re delighted to be able to further the work we do with the NHS and help transform the blood donation service by providing faster connectivity and support.”</p>
      <p>David Suttie, Accountable Executive at NHSBT, said: “There will be many benefits to the new technology solution. It will allow us to collect IT data more effectively, help donors move through the process quicker and reduce paperwork. This will be a positive outcome for our blood donation sessions.”</p>
