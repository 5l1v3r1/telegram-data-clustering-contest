      <h1>ITV This Morning viewers left asking 'where's Phil' as Holly Willoughby forced to present alone</h1>
      <h2>Fans were left confused by the empty seat</h2>

      <p>This Morning viewers were left puzzled today as <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/phillip-schofield">Phillip Schofield</a> was missing from a key segment, forcing <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/holly-willoughby">Holly Willoughby</a> to present alone.</p>
      <p>The 57-year-old was absent from a fashion item which saw Trinny Woodall talk through the best ways to 'power dress'.</p>
      <p>There was an empty seat next to Holly as Phil was nowhere to be seen and fans of the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/itv">ITV</a> daytime show were quick to notice.</p>

      <p>One @Artful_Doodler said: " Phil pulled a disappearing act."</p>
      <p>Another, @DavidMackayy said: " Wait where did @schofe go?"</p>
      <p>A third, @DoubleTreble_said: " Is Phill locked in the loo?"</p>
      <p>A fourth, @GinaTrick said: " Where has @Schofe gone?!?"</p>

      <p>After the segment, Holly sent This Morning to an advert break and when they returned Phil was back by her side with no explanation as to where he had been.</p>
      <p>This isn't the first time male presenters have ducked out of parts of the show that are aimed at a largely female audience.</p>
      <p>Last month <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/itv-morning-viewers-confused-eamonn-17106667">Eamonn Holmes disappeared before a make-up segment</a> , prompting a similar response from fans.</p>

      <p>His wife and co-host Ruth Langsford hosted the item alone and at the end of the item she said: "I am going back to Eamonn now. What are you up to?"</p>
      <p>Eamonn was sat on the main This Morning sofa and he said: "Sorry to ruin your excitement with all that... That was good."</p>
