      <h1>Arsenal fans react as Luis Enrique returns to manage Spain</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:51:17+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/will-butcher/" target="_blank">Will Butcher</a></address>
      <p>Luis Enrique has been returned to his post as Spain manager five months after resigning from the job – and Arsenal fans have reacted on Twitter, with many fuming that their club did not choose to lure Enrique to north London.</p>
      <p>Former Barcelona manager Enrique stepped down from his role as Spain boss back in June after the death of his nine-year-old daughter Xena. His then-assistant manager Roberto Moreno took his place, but Enrique has now returned to the fold.</p>
      <p>Spain qualified for Euro 2020 with ease from Group F, picking up eight wins from their 10 games and drawing the other two. Sweden have also qualified from the group, while Norway have a chance of qualifying through the play-offs.</p>

      <p>Enrique, 49, has enormous experience as a manager – standing in the dugout at Barcelona, Celta Vigo, Roma and Barcelona’s reserve side before taking over as Spain boss in July 2018. Now, he is back in management with Euro 2020 success the prize.</p>
      <p>Arsenal, meanwhile, are struggling under Unai Emery and Enrique is a name that has been touted about by fans and pundits as a spossible successor to Emery at The Emirates. Indeed, Emery is still in a job, but it might not be for much longer.</p>
      <p>Arsenal fans have reacted on Twitter to the news that Enrique will not be making his way to north London in the near future, after taking the Spain job back on – a move that was confirmed on Tuesday.</p>
