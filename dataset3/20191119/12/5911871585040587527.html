      <p>A few months ago, the masterful rapper/producer team of Freddie Gibbs and Madlib released their ridiculously good album <i><a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2048934/freddie-gibbs-madlib-bandana-review/franchises/album-of-the-week/">Bandana</a></i>, the long-awaited follow-up to 2014’s <i>Piñata</i>. Madlib, mercurial as ever, has not been showing up in the videos for the new <i>Bandana</i> songs. But Gibbs has been using those videos to flex his underrated comedy chops. He’s already made commendably ridiculous videos for the <i>Bandana</i> tracks “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2052115/freddie-gibbs-madlib-giannis-anderson-paak-video/news/">Giannis</a>” and “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2058133/freddie-gibbs-madlib-half-manne-half-cocaine-video-feat-eric-andre/video/">Half Manne Half Cocaine</a>.” And today, he’s got a truly absurd new one for the album track “Gat Damn.”</p>
      <p>“Gat Damn” is a relatively smooth song, so Gibbs has come up with a relatively smooth new alter-ego for the video. In the clip, Gibbs plays an old-school R&amp;B showman named Freddie Kane. He’s got a voluminous perm, a coke habit, and a zero-tolerance policy towards the members of his backing band asking him for money. It’s great.</p>
      <p>Gibbs’ fellow underground rapper G Perico is in the video, too, playing a violin player with solo-career aspirations. <i>Black Jesus</i> star Slink Johnson plays a tower bassist. After the song ends, there is a commercial for hair product. <a href="http://www.mcoreywhitted.com/">M. Corey Whitted</a> directs. Watch it below.</p>
