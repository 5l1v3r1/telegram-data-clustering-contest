      <h1>Cold bus drivers accused of 'poisoning' Broadmead workers with engines</h1>
      <h2>"We cannot breathe because of the toxic gases they produce"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:39:35+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:39</time> by <a rel="author">Tristan Cork</a></address>
      <p>A shop worker in one busy street in <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-centre">Bristol city centre</a> says people are ‘being poisoned’ now the cold weather has come - due to bus drivers leave their engines running outside a row of businesses.</p>
      <p>One worker from a shop along the northern side of the Horsefair in <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/broadmead">Broadmead</a> said the onset of the cold weather has made the issue a lot worse, and is calling on First Bus bosses to sort it out.</p>
      <p>First Bus said drivers leaving their engines running are not obeying a policy instructing them to switch them off - and following the complaints, the drivers will be reminded about it.</p>
      <p>The north side of the Horsefair has a long line of bus stops, and many of them are for buses which have reached the end of their route.</p>
      <p>Bus drivers typically have their five or 10-minute break there before starting the return leg of their routes, but since the cold weather began, shop workers say drivers have begun to leave their engines running during that break.</p>
      <p>One worker said the layout of the shopfronts - with the pavement outside covered in part - mean the exhaust fumes from the buses goes straight into multiple shops.</p>
      <h3>'We’re working here all day, every day and it must be really bad for us'</h3>
      <p>Claude Ilie works at a phone shop along the Horsefair, and he said the problem is so bad that, even though the door to his store does not have a bus stop directly outside it, the fumes have spread along to his shop and in to others.</p>

      <p>“They pull up, stop, all the passengers get out and then the bus drivers just sit there with their engines running,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It’s poisoning people. We’re working here all day, every day and it must be really bad for us.</p>
      <p>“There’s cafes along here with tables outside, and tables inside. People are eating and drinking and just sitting there in this.</p>
      <p>“We cannot breathe because of the toxic gases they produce. For all of us that work here, it becomes unbearable. The bus drivers keep their engines running sometimes for 20 minutes at a time.</p>
      <p>“A couple of times I went to ask the drivers to switch their engines off, and they just said they weren’t going to because they were cold. They said they had to keep their engines running,” he added.</p>

      <p>Mark Ford from First West of England, said: “We would like to apologise to anyone who has been negatively impacted by any of our vehicles parked outside their premises with idling engines.</p>
      <p>"Many of our vehicles automatically cut out when they are stationary. However if  a driver has a vehicle that does not have this facility they are instructed that they should turn the engine off if changing drivers or sitting for more than a minute or so while loading passengers and we will be reminding all our drivers of this policy," he added.</p>
