      <p>Bafana Bafana know the ability that they have within their ranks, and for that reason weren’t frustrated when chance after chance was spurned against Sudan over the weekend.</p>

      <p>Lebogang Phiri proved to be the hero for South Africa as his rocket at the end of the first half proved to be the winner for Molefi Ntseki’s side, but Lebo Mothiba, Thapelo Morena, Kermit Erasmus and Thulani Serero could all have been on the scoresheet as well.</p>
      <p>Despite to missed chances though, Bafana were happy to pick up three points against a stubborn Sudanese side that already had their first win of 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualification, and it meant that Ntseki had his first competitive victory since taking over. </p>
      <p>Phiri, who was speaking to the media after the game, insists that they always had faith in themselves though, saying, “For us as players on the pitch we don’t feel so frustrated, because we know the ability we have as individuals and as a collective as well.</p>

      <p>“It was proven when we scored in the final minutes of the first half, and we’d created so many chances before that - nobody gave up, felt frustrated, or felt ‘Ok this is going to be a long day of missing chances’.</p>
      <p>“We kept belief in what we were doing, and the outcome of the game shows it all.”</p>
      <p>Phiri will now return to France where he’ll be hoping to help EA Guingamp in their quest to return to Ligue 1 next season.</p>
