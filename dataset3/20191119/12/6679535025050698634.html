      <h1>Quality onions in Bengaluru may cost ₹100 a kilo in December</h1>

      <p>While low-quality onions, mostly soaked in rain, are available in Bengaluru markets for as low as ₹15 a kilo, the price of the best quality onions have shot up to ₹80 a kilo. It may soon cross ₹100 a kilo in December, say traders in the city.</p>
      <p>Onions from Hubballi-Dharwad and Belagavi flooding the city’s markets are of medium quality and fetching around ₹4,500 per quintal in the APMC market in the city on Monday.</p>
      <p>However, onions from Molakalmuru, Chitradurga reaching the city’s markets are of better quality and were sold for over ₹6,500 per quintal which cost ₹80 a kilo in the retail market.</p>
      <p>“These are onions harvested before the rains that were stored by farmers hoping for a better price. But these are almost over now and will soon run out of stock,” said Ravi Kumar of Bangalore Onion and Potato Merchants Association.</p>
      <p>Onions from Mahaarshtra, especially Pune and Nasik are expected to arrive by December first week. However, the recent spell of rains has led to large-scale crop loss in these areas too creating a high demand for good quality onions in the market. This may drive its price beyond the ₹100 a kilo mark in December, Mr. Kumar said. But onions of a poorer quality will be available for a lower price as well, he added.</p>
