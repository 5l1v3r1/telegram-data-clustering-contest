      <h1>US SEC to Review Bitcoin ETF Rejection, Strategist Says $150K BTC Price Required for Approval</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:40:12+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://dailyhodl.com/author/thedailyhodl/" target="_blank">Daily Hodl Staff</a></address>
      <p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission will revisit its rejection of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposal. The SEC rejected the most recent proposal from Bitwise ETF and NYSE Arca on October 9th, citing concerns about market manipulation and risks to investors.</p>
      <p>The Commission’s latest efforts to revisit their decision appear to be their own. The five commissioners issued a notice dated today in the <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/11/18/2019-24874/self-regulatory-organizations-nyse-arca-inc-order-scheduling-filing-of-statements-on-review-for-an">Federal Register</a>, following the October <a href="https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nysearca/2019/34-87267.pdf">order</a> to reject.</p>
      <p>The review process once again opens the proposal to public comments about the Bitwise Bitcoin ETF.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Accordingly, it is ordered, pursuant to Commission Rule of Practice 431, that by December 18, 2019, any party or other person may file a statement in support of, or in opposition to, the action made pursuant to delegated authority.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>It is further ordered that the order disapproving proposed rule change SR-NYSEArca-2019-01 shall remain in effect pending the Commission’s review.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>The SEC has yet to approve a Bitcoin ETF.</p>
      <p>Since the Commission’s October rejection, institutional investors are showing increasing interest in products that offer exposure to Bitcoin.</p>
      <p>Bakkt, the regulated Bitcoin futures trading platform that is owned and operated by Intercontinental Exchange, reveals sustained interest after a slow start. Once its daily trading volume surged on October 23rd, three subsequent days broke trading records and set new all-time highs.</p>

      <p>Binance, a major player in the crypto space, has launched Binance.US, a regulated cryptocurrency exchange for US residents. Early results show 24-hour trading volume topped $15 million by the end of October. Incentives to spark consumer confidence included the announcement of <a href="https://support.binance.us/hc/en-us/articles/360035339351-Binance-US-Introduces-FDIC-Insurance-Coverage-on-USD-Deposits">FDIC insurance coverage</a> of up to $250,000 for all US depositors.</p>
      <p>On November 16, Binance.US CEO Catherine Coley <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptocoley/status/1195710698858405890">announced</a> $759 million in trades by day 50.</p>
      <p>While crypto enthusiasts have called out the SEC for taking too long to approve a Bitcoin ETF, Thomas Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat Global Advisors and a long-term Bitcoin bull, disagrees.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Might be an unpopular opinion, but we believe the SEC</i>
        <i> is doing its job pretty well.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>Lee <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-15/bitcoin-should-hit-150-000-before-an-etf-can-work-tom-lee-says?srnd=markets-vp">says</a> the $200-billion crypto market is too small and that Bitcoin will need to hit $150,000 in price before it can sustain an ETF.</p>
