      <h1>Govt proposes national cyber regime for IoT</h1>
      <h2>Voluntary code to apply to smart devices such speakers, TVs.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:14:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:14</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.itnews.com.au/author/justin-hendry-1167397" target="_blank">Justin Hendry</a></address>
      <p>Everyday Internet of Things devices such as AI-enabled smart speakers and smart TVs will be subject to a new Australian code of practice to better protect against malicious cyber threats.</p>
      <p>With concerns over the always-on devices and privacy reaching fever-pitch, the federal government has moved to introduce voluntary national standards for IoT security.</p>
      <p>The code, developed by the Department of Home Affairs and Australian Cyber Security Centre, will offer best practice guidance to device manufacturers, IoT service providers and app developers.</p>
      <p>Minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton said that ensuring the security of everyday smart devices, which Gartner estimates will reach more than 64 billion globally by 2025, was “paramount”.</p>
      <p>He said that currently “many of these devices have poor cyber security features”, which poses risk to Australians, the economy and national security.</p>
      <p>The draft code, which the government is <a href="https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/reports-and-publications/submissions-and-discussion-papers/code-of-practice">currently seeking community and industry input on</a>, lays down the 13 cyber security principles that industry will be expected to embedded in IoT devices.</p>
      <p>“Devices are often developed with functionality as a priority, with security being absent or an afterthought,” the draft code states.</p>
      <p> “It is essential that these devices have cyber security provisions to defend against potential threats.”</p>
      <p>While the government recommends implementing all 13 principles, the first three are considered the “highest priority to achieve the greatest security benefit”. These principles are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>No duplicated default or weak passwords: ensure IoT device passwords aren’t week or a factory default common to multiple devices</li>
        <li>Implement a vulnerability disclosure policy: ensure there is a public point of contract for security researchers to report issues and that that any vulnerabilities are acted on quickly</li>
        <li>Keep software securely updated: ensure “timely” updates, which are distributed via secure IT infrastructure, that don’t change user-configured preferences, security or privacy</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Other principles include ensuring credentials aren’t stored on a device to avoid that data being discovered through reverse engineering (principle 4), minimising the exposed attack surface (principle 6) and making systems resilient to outages (principle 9).</p>
      <p>The government has also recommended “adequate industry-standard encryption ... be applied to personal data in transit and data at rest” in order to ensure that personal data is protected (principle five).</p>
      <p>"We're releasing the Code of Practice for public consultation because we want to ensure that the expectations of all Australians are met regarding cyber security," Dutton said.</p>
      <p>"Along with our Five Eyes partners we share the expectation that manufacturers should develop connected devices with security built in by design.”</p>
      <p>The code aligns with and builds upon similar guidance issued by the UK in its code of practice of consumer IoT security [<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/773867/Code_of_Practice_for_Consumer_IoT_Security_October_2018.pdf">pdf</a>], which also consists of 13 principles.</p>
      <p>Public consultation on the draft code will run until 1 March 2020.</p>
