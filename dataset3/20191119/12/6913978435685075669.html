      <p><b>LONDON - </b>Sinn Fein's former leader Gerry Adams on Tuesday heads to Britain's highest court to challenge two convictions from the darkest days of the violence in Northern Ireland in the 1970s.<br/><br/>In the early days of "The Troubles", Adams was held without trial, under special "internment" measures designed to quell increasing unrest over British rule of the province.<br/><br/>He tried to escape from the high-security Maze prison near Belfast, which housed loyalist and republican paramilitary inmates, in December 1973 and July 1974.<br/><br/>But the plans, reportedly orchestrated by the Irish Republican Army (IRA), both failed. He was convicted of both attempts in March and April 1975.<br/><br/>Adams, now 71, did not challenge the guilty verdicts at the time but is now attempting to have them overturned following the release of previously classified government documents.<br/><br/>According to the Supreme Court, the issue at stake is whether his original custody order was "rendered invalid by the fact that it was made by the Minister of State (for Northern Ireland) and had not been considered personally by the Secretary of State".<br/><br/>Northern Ireland's Court of Appeal previously dismissed the case in February last year.<br/><br/>Three judges said they were satisfied the detention order was valid as the junior minister was acting on behalf of his superior.<br/><br/>Internment was a controversial policy when it was introduced to try to end the spiraling violence between pro-British loyalists and republicans who wanted a united Ireland.<br/><br/>Between 1971 and 1975 nearly 2,000 mainly republican prisoners were held without trial, according to Ulster University. -AFP</p>
