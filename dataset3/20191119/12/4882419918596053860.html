      <p>Jürgen Klopp usually surprises when he gives interviews or makes comments. The German coach doesn't often bite his tongue when it comes to the big subjects.</p>
      <p>The Liverpool coach has spoken to FIFA this week about various topics. One of them was the stadium where he feels most uncomfortable as the opposition. The answer was surprising.</p>
      <p>"I don't know if it's the best stadium to play in, but the stadium I hate playing in the most is Sevilla's because of the atmosphere it has... that's a compliment!" he said.</p>
      <p>It's a curious comment given Klopp has coached at some of the toughest stadiums in the world. including in England and in Germany in his time with Mainz, Borussia Dortmund and Liverpool.</p>
      <p>However, his results at Sevilla's Sanchez Pizjuan have not been good. He's played there with Mainz, Dortmund and Liverpool and has never won. With Liverpool, his side was 3-0 up, but eventually drew 3-3.</p>
