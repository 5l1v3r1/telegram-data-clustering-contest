      <p><b>CONWAY, Ark. (AP) - </b>A former high school student in Arkansas has been sentenced to seven years in prison for devising a plan to shoot up a school.</p>
      <p>Circuit Judge Charles Clawson sentenced 20-year-old Daniel Croslin on Friday. Croslin pleaded guilty to making a terrorist threat in September.</p>
      <p>Court documents show Croslin made plans to shoot up Conway High School on the 20th anniversary of the Columbine massacre. Croslin was 19 when he told a counselor that he was bullied in school and wanted to get revenge.</p>
      <p>Police found Croslinâ€™s notes that included a diagram of the school and evidence that he recruited friends to help him buy an assault rifle and item needed for a pipe bomb.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Hugh Finkelstein says they are lucky the professionals who encountered Croslin took his threats seriously.</p>
