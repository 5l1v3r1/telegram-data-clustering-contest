      <h1>Republic of Ireland fans think Aston Villa’s Conor Hourihane shouldn’t have been subbed off</h1>
      <h2>Conor Hourihane takes the set-pieces.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:45:49+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/jay-williams/" target="_blank">Jay Williams</a></address>
      <p>Conor Hourihane played 68 minutes as the Republic of Ireland fell narrowly short of qualification.</p>
      <p>The Republic of Ireland hosted Denmark at The Aviva Stadium in a must-win game for the home side. Denmark just needed a draw to progress and they managed to sneak through.</p>
      <p>Martin Braithwaite’s 73rd-minute goal put Denmark into a commanding position with the hosts needing to score twice in 17 minutes. Matt Doherty did bring the Republic of Ireland level on 85 minutes but it was too little too late at that point.</p>
      <h3>Hourihane hauled off</h3>

      <p>Hourihane was named in the starting line-up, operating in a central midfield position. However, with the Boys in Green still chasing a goal, Mick McCarthy decided Hourihane was the man to take off.</p>
      <p>This decision did not go down too well among some Republic of Ireland fans. Hourihane is renowned for his set-piece delivery. Many fans felt that the 28-year-old would have offered more than Jeff Hendrick, Glenn Whelan and James McClean towards the end of the game.</p>
      <p>Here are some tweets about McCarthy’s decision to take Hourihane off.</p>
