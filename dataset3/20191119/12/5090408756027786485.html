        <li>United has launched a special new “<a href="https://www.insider.com/category/star-wars">Star Wars</a>“-themed Boeing 737-800 plane.</li>
        <li>The plane was launched to celebrate the release of “<a href="https://www.businessinsider.sg/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-trailer-video-football-2019-10/">The Rise of Skywalker</a>.”</li>
        <li>Decked out in dueling Resistance and First Order livery, the plane is flying across the US, Canada, Central America, and the Caribbean.</li>
        <li>Passengers can book a flight by looking up the aircraft’s tail number, N36272.</li>
        <li>United also has a <a href="https://hub.united.com/sp/star-wars/">webpage</a> dedicated to the plane and its “Star Wars” promotions.</li>

      <p>Luke Skywalker may have claimed the Millennium Falcon was a “piece of junk” when he first saw it (even though it could, you know, make point-five past lightspeed) – but he probably wouldn’t be saying that about United Airlines’ shiny new Boeing 737-800.</p>
      <p>To celebrate the December theatrical release of “The Rise of Skywalker,” billed as the last film in the nine-film Skywalker saga, <a href="https://www.insider.com/united-airlines-star-wars-plane-2019-10">the airline has launched a special “Star Wars”-themed plane</a> – and though it can’t travel at lightspeed, it does look pretty spiffy, or at least nothing at all like the heavily modified ship of a certain scruffy-looking nerf herder (sorry, Han Solo).</p>
      <p>The plane made its first flight earlier this month, from Houston to Orlando, Florida. Though there were plenty of evil First Order stormtroopers on hand, thankfully no one was taken away for questioning by Kylo Ren.</p>
      <p>Here’s what the plane is like inside.</p>

      <h3>The Force — er, flight — is strong with the Boeing 737-800’s galactic-themed livery, which revels in the power of the Dark Side on one side …</h3>
