      <p>Furious 4 may not be a title all of our readers will remember, so a little history lesson is in order. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK2s982TzxQ">Announced at Ubisoft's E3 2011 conference</a> with Gearbox as the developer, it was originally meant to be another entry in the Brothers in Arms series. However, given its non-historic portrayal of World War II (the setting and characters were more akin to Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds), Gearbox decided to spin Furious 4 into its own separate IP.</p>
      <p>Sadly, that didn't prevent the game's cancellation in July 2015. During an interview from last week's G-Star, our Kai Powell managed to discuss the project a bit with Gearbox producer Randy Varnell. The 'Head of Story Group' still remembers Furious 4 quite fondly and wishes it actually released. Later, he said Gearbox as a whole would love to do something else in the Brothers in Arms franchise.</p>

      <blockquote><b>Actually, I did get to see Furious 4 when they were demonstrating it so many years ago.</b><br/>Oh my gosh. Someone remembers!<br/><b>Yeah, I thought the concept looked really cool. </b><br/>Did you come to see the press demo?<br/><b>Yeah</b>.<br/>You probably saw me doing the demo, I was handling that for the project at E3. It was like 2011, man. That game! I wish we would have shipped that game. Furious 4 was actually tremendously good. It was really good. The business reasons [got it canned], it wasn't any creative reasons, it was all that dumb stuff that happens at the back end that I can't talk about. But yeah, we were really excited about Furious 4. We paused that to go work on Borderlands 2, I don't think that was ultimately a bad decision as Borderlands 2 has done pretty well for us.<br/><b>True. It just feels like the whole Brothers in Arms IP has just kind of been floating out there ever since.</b><br/>It has and it's something we're very aware of at Gearbox. I can't say anything, but we would love to do something else there.</blockquote>
      <p>Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford <a href="https://twitter.com/DuvalMagic/status/1000924470293549056">did state some time ago</a> there is indeed work under the way on the IP, but the lack of proper announcements certainly doesn't provide any assurance as of yet. With <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/borderlands-3/">Borderlands 3</a> mostly out of the way (DLC development excluded), though, it may be the next big project for Gearbox.</p>
      <p>Check back tomorrow for our full interview with Borderlands 3 producer Randy Varnell.</p>
