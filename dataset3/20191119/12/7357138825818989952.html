      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:00:53+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pymnts.com/author/pymnts/" target="_blank">PYMNTS</a></address>
      <p>Global identity verification provider <a href="https://www.trulioo.com/">Trulioo</a> is appointing General Manager Zac Cohen as chief operating officer (COO), the company announced in a press release on Tuesday (Nov. 19).</p>
      <p>As COO, Cohen will oversee Trulioo’s senior leadership team and spearhead the company’s continued global expansion. He will also oversee policy, budget and investor relations while continuing to advance innovative solutions for instant identity verification.</p>
      <p>Stephen Ufford, chief executive officer of Trulioo, said that under Cohen’s leadership revenue has grown 150 percent year over year. Staff expanded to 140 people across offices in Vancouver, San Francisco and Dublin. </p>
      <p>“Zac has played a critical role in Trulioo’s success over the past five years,” he said, adding that Cohen is a “vital contributor to our executive team as we continue to grow and thrive while advancing our mission of financial inclusion.”</p>
      <p>With a strong background in technology and compliance, Cohen has served as Trulioo’s general manager since 2015 and has assisted with the company’s fundraising success. Trulioo has raised $96.6 million to date, with early investors Blumberg Capital, BDC Capital and American Express. More recently, investors have included Goldman Sachs, Citi Ventures and Santander InnoVentures.</p>
      <p>“Trulioo’s journey from startup to scaleup is the epitome of why tech is the most impactful and exciting industry in the world,“ said Cohen. “We’re on a mission to build trust online and ensure that everyone everywhere has the opportunity to participate in the digital economy.” </p>
      <p>Cohen added that the company has “ambitious goals” and he will lead efforts to build “a world-class tech company.” </p>
      <p>Trulioo’s expanded global operations use a single API integration to offer instant verification of 5 billion people and 250 businesses in over 195 countries. </p>
      <p>In July, the company expanded operations to include Bahrain, Iceland, Qatar and Georgia. Trulioo noted that each of those countries has committed to what it termed “a concerted effort to strengthen their fight against money laundering.” That comes as money laundering is estimated to cost the world between $800 billion and $2 trillion each year.</p>
