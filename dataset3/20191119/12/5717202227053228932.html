      <h1>Tottenham star Harry Winks responds when asked about Mauricio Pochettino’s future</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:15:36+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/will-butcher/" target="_blank">Will Butcher</a></address>
      <p>Tottenham Hotspur star Harry Winks has paid tribute to Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino <a href="https://talksport.com/radioplayer/live/">on TalkSPORT</a> (10.25am, Tuesday) amid reports that the Argentine manager could be about to leave Spurs in the near future.</p>
      <p>Spurs have endured an enormously difficult start to the 2019-20 campaign, which has seen Spurs win just three of their 12 Premier League matches so far. They sit in a lowly 14th place, putting Pochettino under the spotlight.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/tottenham-mauricio-pochettino-next-manager-potential-replacements-latest-a9208436.html">The Independent claimed</a> on Tuesday morning that former Southampton and Espanyol manager Pochettino is “on the brink” at Tottenham, after speaking to chairman Daniel Levy. It is believed six bosses have been selected as potential replacements.</p>
      <p>They include Julian Nagelsmann, Jose Mourinho, Eddie Howe, Max Allegri, Carlo Ancelotti and Ralph Rangnick – but Winks praised on Pochettino who gave the midfielder his debut and broke him into the team, when asked about Pochettino’s future.</p>
      <p>
        <span dir="auto">“I’ve said many times. I’ve got all the time for the gaffer. I wouldn’t be where I am without him. Getting that opportunity is always difficult but I am forever grateful for him,” <a href="https://talksport.com/radioplayer/live/">Winks said.</a><br/></span>

      <h3>TBR’s view – How long will Pochettino be given to turn things around?</h3>
      <p>Pochettino can be excused for the likes of Christian Eriksen and the poor performances of other players, given that some are looking to leave in the near future – Danny Rose and Toby Alderweireld, for example.</p>
      <p>Levy also needs to take some blame in the situation. The chairman has not backed Pochettino enough, and now the pressure is on, Pochettino is getting blamed. But Poch is to blame for his constant rotation and strange substitutions.</p>
      <p>The new manager should be given January to stamp his mark on the side. So Pochettino should be given the Christmas period to try and change his side’s fortunes.</p>
