      <p>Onda Cero have revealed that Juan Carlos Unzue will be Luis Enrique's No.2 as the former Barcelona coach returns to the Spain job this week.</p>
      <p>Luis Enrique left the role officially five months ago due to his daughter's health. She sadly passed away and, following a period of mourning, he has now decided to return as Spain coach.</p>
      <p>Robert Moreno had sat in for him and had previously been his No.2 with the national team but is now expected to leave his coaching job with La Roja altogether.</p>
      <p>Therefore, Unzue is expected to fill the vacancy as Luis Enrique's No.2 ahead of next summer's European Championships, which will be played in venues across the country.</p>
      <p>Unzue was Lucho's No.2 at Barcelona but then moved into management on his own. He has coached Celta Vigo and, more recently, Girona.</p>
