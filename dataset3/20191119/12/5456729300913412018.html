      <p>At least 12 corpses were affected in an early morning fire outbreak on Tuesday at the morgue of the Department of Anatomy, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile Ife, Osun State.</p>
      <p>PREMIUM TIMES gathered that the affected corpses were kept in the cabin of the morgue.</p>
      <p>The spokesperson of the university, Abiodun Olarewaju, in a statement on Tuesday afternoon, said the incident was prevented from turning into a major fire outbreak by the combined efforts of the security and fire services units of the University.</p>
      <p>Mr Olarewaju said the fire outbreak occurred at about 3 a.m. from an electrical surge. He said the fire affected a section of the morgue where corpses are kept.</p>
      <p>“Out of about one hundred and two (102) bodies that are kept in the morgue, twelve (12) were affected by the fire outbreak,” the statement said.</p>
      <p>He, however, said the department had informed “those who have kept bodies (corpses) in the morgue.</p>
      <p>“Leading other Principal Officers to the scene of the incident, the Vice-Chancellor, Professor Eyitope Ogunbodede, assessed the level of damage and instructed immediate repairs to the affected areas.</p>
      <p>“The Vice-Chancellor has also constituted a three-member committee to look into the immediate and remote causes of the fire outbreak. Normalcy of academic and administrative activities has since returned to the area,” the official said.</p>
