      <p>A white, black and red pair of Air Jordan 1s is a staple for any sneakerheads collection and Jordan Brand has no shortage of options to choose from. There have been countless such colorways released over the years, including a couple over the last 12 months alone.</p>
      <p>The latest, dubbed the "Bloodline" Air Jordan 1 Retro High OG, will be making it's way to retailers across the country on Black Friday, November 29, for the retail price of $160. The special edition colorway is inspired by the brand's “Who Said Man Was Not Meant To Fly” ad from 1985, and as a nod to that commercial the kicks come equipped with an extra set of black laces bearing that phrase. As always, I expect the 1s to be a popular pickup when they release but with everything else going on during Black Friday, there should be plenty of pairs to go around.</p>
      <p>And if you've already had your fill of white, black and red 1s, I also previewed the all-new "Eclipse" Air Jordan 34 which comes in a clean black &amp; white color combo. As someone who hasn't been a fan of many Air Jordans after the Air Jordan XIV, it's truly difficult to find anything bad to say about the Air Jordan 34 - both on the court and as an everyday lifestyle sneaker. The kicks, priced at $180, are readily available today at all major retailers.</p>
      <p>Let us know what you think of the "Bloodline" Air Jordan 1 Retro High OG and the "Eclipse" Air Jordan 34 in the comments.</p>
