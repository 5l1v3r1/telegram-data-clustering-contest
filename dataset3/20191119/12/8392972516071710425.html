      <p>ITV has confirmed that Scarlett Moffatt will not be returning to <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/saturday-night-takeaway/">Ant &amp; Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway</a>.</p>
      <p>When she landed the job in 2017, after winning I'm a Celebrity in 2016, Scarlett said the role – in which she worked alongside <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/ant-mcpartlin/">Ant McPartlin</a> and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/declan-donnelly/">Declan Donnelly</a> – was her "dream job".</p>
      <p>Now, however, it has been confirmed that Scarlett "won't feature as a contributor" in the new series, which is set to air on ITV in 2020.</p>

      <p>She said: "I don’t know why this is a big story because it hasn’t been on for two years. It’s not like a rolling contract. They are just changing the format of the show. My bit was like challenge Anneka, and they have taken that out.</p>
      <p>"It will still be amazing with Ant and Dec and Stephen, what a trio of men."</p>
      <p>Ant and Dec are currently busy in Australia fronting the new series of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity – Get Me Out Of Here!</a>.</p>
