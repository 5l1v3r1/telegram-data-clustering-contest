      <p>The Queen Bee offers a retrospective on her most famous image.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News) </b>Kimberly "Lil Kim" Jones is often credited as one of the women that broke down the door for female rappers to embrace their sexuality. For example, Kim shocked the world with her classic "Hard Core" poster in the mid-1990s.</p>
      <p>The Notorious B.I.G. protégé reflected on her career while appearing on Talib Kweli's<i> People's Party </i>show. The two Brooklynites discussed the Queen Bee infiltrating the "boys club" and becoming a feminist icon in the eyes of some.</p>

      <p>"It's always been a grey area for me, because my thing is I definitely, in some way, am a feminist because I support my women," said Lil Kim. "That's the one thing that was always my main focus is that my girls had somebody to speak for them all the time."</p>
      <p>She added, "It was never 'kill all men' or 'men are horrible'... You can't bash men, but there is a crew that is like that." The "Crush on You" performer also talked about her memorable, influential pose.</p>
      <p>"As a female when I was coming into the game and I did the 'Hard Core' poster, the famous squat, that was game changing. And so many women were hating on me, I was surprised," the <i>9</i> album creator recalled. "It was sexy. To me, it wasn't tasteless. It was classy, it was cute, I was fresh-faced." </p>
