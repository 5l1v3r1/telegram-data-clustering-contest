      <h1>‘If I weren’t singing, I would be a masseur’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:45:35+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:45</time> by <a rel="author">Doreen Nanziri</a></address>
      <p>Kenneth Mugabi is a unique and memorable singer, songwriter and guitarist. He first claimed the limelight as one of the contestants of Coca-Cola Rated Next talent show, then became a regular performer at the Milege Acoustic Jazz Project every Thursday at Makerere University guesthouse where patrons adore his voice and storytelling skill. Quick Talk talked to the Kibunomu singer shortly before his recent show at the National Theatre where the interview was constantly interrupted by phone calls…</p>
      <p>
        <b>Good evening, Kenneth!</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes, good evening!</p>
      <p>
        <b>How would you describe Kenneth Mugabi?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kenneth Mugabi is an artist, soulful performer, artiste and greatly known for my Naki song. My family background is so big and scattered, I basically grew up with my mother and cousins. My late mother was a single mum and I spent most of my time at home with her when not at school.</p>
      <p>I went to Kibiri Church of Uganda primary school then, Lubiri High School [O-level], Makerere High School for my A-level and Makerere University where I pursued a BA in Film and Drama.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Who inspired you to join the singing competition?</b>
      </p>
      <p>You know when there is something inside you that wants to come out? Like a caged bird<i>. </i>So, for me it was more of something that I wanted to release. The talent was in me because my mother used to sing and write church songs at St Luke’s Church of Uganda, Kibuye.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Talking about caged birds, is that why you failed with school choirs?</b>
      </p>
      <p>[Laughs, slapping a hand to his forehead] Well, at Kibuye primary school, I was recruited in the choir three times but each time I would run away<i>.</i> I did not want to be part of them because kiboko zali nyingi ennaku ezo, yaye mama nze! [there was a lot of caning back then]. I, however, enjoyed being part of them and had to find ways of not being part of them, yet always be around. [He and his friends followed the rehearsals from the windows].</p>
      <p>
        <b>How could that benefit you?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Actually I learnt playing most instruments just by watching from the window.</p>
      <p>Why Afro soul music?</p>
      <p>[After a long silence] I would say that soul recognises soul. It’s like a Muganda going to Gulu and suddenly meets a fellow Muganda; you will start speaking and feel like you are home. That is me with soul music. I used to listen to Paul Kafeero, Fred Ssebata, [and] Lucky Dube because my mother used to listen to that. Kadongokamu inspired me a lot [One can recognise that influence in Mugabi’s storytelling and guitar skills].</p>
      <p>Along the way, Mowzey Radio came and I was touched; he was so different. Morris Kirya also had something different. I went picking something from all these musicians and came up with my own genre, Afro soul.</p>
      <p>
        <b>I see; by the way Kenneth, what would you be doing if not singing?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I think acting.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Have you ever tried it before?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yeah. I even act in my songs [chuckles]</p>
      <p>
        <b>And outside the arts?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Aahh… maybe [be a masseur], travelling, if it was paying [It does, if you are a cabin crew member on some airline…] I am also fascinated by farming and dealing in local medicine. I rarely go to hospital; [my theory is:] if you are suffering from anything, take a glass of aloe vera.</p>
      <p>
        <b>But why masseur coming at the top?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I was thinking out loud [laughs]<i>…</i> massage is more like medicine; so, it is not surprising, because even my music massages the soul so, there is a connection.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Away from that, what is your most memorable moment?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Strings Of My Soul, which was my first concert. It was so exhausting but very interesting. How I wish it lasted longer, but it was just hours. It was my first concert but people enjoyed and I too enjoyed seeing people enjoy.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Did life change thereafter?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes, of course! People’s enjoyment elevated me, after struggling all those years. This particular concert made everything easy because I am releasing an album this year.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Do you have a ‘most embarrassing moment’?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I was chased off a stage [he goes silent, like it still stings] I was chased off stage! [He whistles and shakes his head in wonder] I remember it was Embuutu y’Embutikizi [an annual music gala by Bukedde FM]. I walked up to Makindye from Nakivubo to release the anger. By the way it was so recent, after Coca-Cola Rated Next. I did not even open my mouth and the crowd started shouting “waaa… vaayo” [get off the stage].</p>
      <p>
        <b>Such embarrassments can turn out to be a motivation.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Well, I am sure that some of those who chased me off that stage are enjoying Naki.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Sorry about that, man. What do you do in your free time?</b>
      </p>
      <p>If I am not writing songs and doing my business, I am always home helping out my sisters with house chores [aww! The image of that…], then I go out the do corporate social responsibility.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Ok…when do you spend time with your ‘Naki’? Could you be single?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Do you have an application – pending or otherwise?</p>
      <p>
        <b>Hahaha! No. Really!</b>
      </p>
      <p>Why! Do I look ugly?</p>
      <p>
        <b>Hahaha, don’t change the subject; are you single, searching or married?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I am not married, that’s all I can say, because you can be seeing someone but you don’t know what will happen ... I prefer saying I’m not married yet, instead of saying that I’m seeing someone, because I might say it today and she goes the next day.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Such pessimism! OK, who is your ideal woman?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Physically, a woman who is not that into makeup. I like a smart woman, because most of my things are here [touches his head]<i>.</i> All the rest can be handled but she has to be smart because I don’t want someone who is very dependent. I know we are supposed to take care of you, but she isn’t supposed to over depend on me until we are married because once married, then you are my responsibility. I would also like someone who sees things quickly and does not fear me.</p>
      <p>[Exhales heavily] I hope I won’t end up alone, because of what I want. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Hmmm, you might be one of those stingy men I hear about!</b>
      </p>
      <p>Me!? My name is Mugabi [it means giver in Luganda]; so, I can’t be stingy at all. By the way, there are things that don’t make sense, which girls do, like being jealous yet you’re not allowed to be.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Shaaa! Jealousy is part of love!</b>
      </p>
      <p>Here is the thing, I have gone for introduction at your home; so, why be jealous?</p>
      <p>
        <b>To take you back though, I think every woman needs a little makeup sometimes...</b>
      </p>
      <p>Makingup is fine but, she has to be comfortable without makeup, because there are those not comfortable without it. I want a woman who comfortably lives without it.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How do you express the romantic side of you?</b>
      </p>
      <p>A mere listening to my music will give you a real picture of it all.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Wapi! Sometimes you people sing the reverse of what is happening in your real lives.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Life is not a movie; for example, me before dating a girl, I first give you a hard time for quite some time and see if you can persist. By the way, I give people a hard time but all this is to help me know who you truly are, your dos and don’ts and see if I can persist too.</p>
      <p>I receive calls but I don’t call; I call when I want to call but not when I have to call or when you want me to call; I do things my way than doing them other people’s ways. [Eh! Yes, Quick Talk hopes you don’t end up alone, brother.]</p>
      <p>
        <b>Now, if you were president for a day…</b>
      </p>
      <p>I would focus on job creation than job seeking and change the education system. Ugandans are creative but they don’t know where to start from; so, I would really provide such platforms for the youth.</p>
