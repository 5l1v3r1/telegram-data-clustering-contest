      <p>DHAKA: The Bangladesh <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket">Cricket</a> Board on Tuesday banned former national team fast bowler <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Shahadat-Hossain">Shahadat Hossain</a> for five years, two of them suspended, after he assaulted a teammate in a match.</p>
      <p>The temperamental Shahadat was reported by umpires after he was seen to slap and kick a teammate during a <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/National-Cricket-League">National Cricket League</a> match on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The national federation suspended two years of the ban but Shahadat, who admitted a charge of "physical assault", was also fined 300,000 taka ($3,540), the board said.</p>
      <p>Shahadat, 33, attacked young bowler <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Arafat-Sunny">Arafat Sunny</a> Jr during a game between Dhaka and Khulna after an argument over how to shine the ball, a board official said.</p>
      <p>"Considering his past behaviour we decided to punish him for five years. The last two years of his ban will remain suspended," said BCB technical committee chief Minhajul Abedin.</p>
      <p>Shahadat could have been banned for life.</p>
      <p>Shahadat, who played 38 Tests and 51 one-day internationals for Bangladesh, spent nearly two months in detention in 2015 after he and his wife were accused of torturing an 11-year-old girl they employed as a maid. They were cleared when it came to trial however.</p>
      <p>Shahadat hit the headlines again in 2018 when he allegedly beat a rickshaw driver for hitting his car in Dhaka.</p>
