      <h1>Rajya Sabha adjourned till 2 pm over JNU protests</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T12:06:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 12:06</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/pti" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>Rajya Sabha proceedings on Tuesday were adjourned till 2 pm after opposition uproar over alleged police action on protesting JNU students in the national capital and detention of political leaders in Jammu and Kashmir.</p>
      <p>Soon after the House met for the day, Left and other opposition party members raised the two issues.</p>
      <p>Around 100 JNU students were detained and some were injured when police allegedly baton-charged protesters as they marched towards Parliament on Monday, demanding a total rollback of the hostel fee hike.</p>
      <p>Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu said the adjournment notices received from members do not warrant setting aside the listed business of the day.</p>
      <p>"You will be disturbing the entire House. That is not a matter to adjourn business," he said and warned members that he would be forced to adjourn proceedings if they continued protests.</p>
      <p>But the members were unrelenting and continued to raise the issues from their seats.</p>
      <p>Naidu called for Zero Hour mentions but with opposition members unrelenting, he adjourned the proceedings till 2 pm.</p>
      <p>Earlier, the House mourned the death of former Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, who Naidu described as a "true friend of India" and one of the tallest world leaders.</p>
      <p>Mugabe died on September 6 at the age of 95.</p>
      <p>The House also congratulated Abhijit Banerjee for winning the Nobel Prize for Economics.</p>
      <p>Naidu said Banerjee, Esther Duflo and Michael Kremer won the prestigious award for their experimental approach to alleviating global poverty.</p>
      <p>Banerjee winning the Nobel is indeed a matter of great pride for India, he said.</p>
