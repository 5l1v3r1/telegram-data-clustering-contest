      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/strictly-come-dancing/">Strictly Come Dancing</a>’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/saffron-barker/">Saffron Barker</a> has opened up about her family’s home being burgled while they slept.</p>
      <p>The YouTube star said her car was stolen in the terrifying raid, with her brother Jed hearing someone coming into his room in the middle of the night.</p>
      <p>‘It’s been a very stressful morning,’ she admitted in a now-deleted video. ‘My dad woke up this morning like he usually would, went to go outside and go to work and realised that all our cars were gone.</p>
      <p>‘So basically our cars have been stolen. We got broken into last night and stuff inside our house was taken, like handbags and shoes as well.</p>

      <p>‘I was so upset this morning and obviously still am, but luckily we’re all safe and that’s what’s most important.</p>
      <p>‘This stuff can be replaced, but it is horrible knowing that someone’s come into your house while you’re sleeping.</p>

      <p>‘We know exactly what time it happened last night because Jed heard somebody in his room at 3am and just thought it was us. He said he saw flashing lights and stuff but was half asleep so he genuinely thought it was just us.’</p>
      <p>After deleting the video Saffron said she worried it might be ‘a little too early’ to speak out, with police still investigating.</p>

      <p>‘The reason I’m mentioning this is because people that did see the vlog have been so worried and concerned,’ she explained in a second video.</p>
      <p>‘I just want to say thank you so much. Me and my family are totally fine, and that’s what is most important.’</p>
      <p>Since, the 19-year-old has not let the ordeal get her down, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/strictly-come-dancings-saffron-barker-blesses-us-sneak-peeks-blackpool-rehearsals-stars-arrive-11162397/">grinning away in training with her partner AJ Pritchard.</a></p>
      <p>It’s been a tough week for Saffron <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/strictly-come-dancing-fans-gutted-michelle-visage-eliminated-facing-saffron-barker-dance-off-11172457/">after she landed in the dance-off on the show, fighting for her place with co-star Michelle Visage.</a></p>
      <p>Although she looked tearful ahead of the performance, she was saved by the judges after a unanimous decision.</p>
