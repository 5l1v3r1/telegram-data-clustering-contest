        <b>The latest word around the rumour mill is that Premier League giants Manchester United have started keeping an eye on Reading FC’s 19-year-old forward Danny Loader.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Loader’s current contract at the EFL Championship side will terminate in 2020 June, after which he will be available to sign with any club as a free agent.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/man-utd-eyeing-reading-ace-20908140"><i>Daily Star</i></a> further reports that talks between the player and the club have stalled over a new deal, thereby putting several other Premier League clubs as well on high alert – apart from Manchester United.</p>
      <p>The English youngster joined Reading as a youth player in 2012, after spending his earliest years at Wycombe Wanderers. He was then promoted to their Under-18 team in 2016, and later, to the Under-23 team in 2017.</p>
      <p>And on 2019 Jan 1, he was offered his first-ever senior contract with the club, since when he has made 29 appearances for the first-team.</p>
      <p>It is also worth mentioning that Loader was handed his first competitive bow by former Reading’s manager Jaap Stam, who is also an-ex Manchester United star.</p>
      <p>That being said, it can be understood that thanks to Stam, the Red Devils have a major upper hand over the other Premier League clubs, in the transfer race for signing him.</p>
