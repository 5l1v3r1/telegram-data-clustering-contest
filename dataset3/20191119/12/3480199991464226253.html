      <p>Boris Johnson tried his hand at boxing as he visited a gym in Manchester, revealing he “loves” the sport.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister entered the ring with the head coach of Jimmy Egan’s Boxing Academy in Wythenshawe to practice his punches.</p>
      <p>He will be hoping to politically knock out Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn during a head-to-head debate on ITV later on Tuesday.</p>

      <p>Mr Johnson, who removed his suit jacket and rolled up his sleeves for the occasion, donned a navy blue pair of “Get Brexit Done” gloves in the ring.</p>
      <p>He said he should not be “aggressive” and instead said it was “more therapeutic boxing” as he joked about punching photographers on the side.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson left the ring as two more serious boxers entered, saying he would “quit while he’s ahead”.</p>

      <p>Steve Egan, the boxing coach who sparred with the Prime Minister in the ring, told PA news agency Mr Johnson was “strong” but a “bit rusty”.</p>
      <p>“He felt strong, punch-wise. He’s built for it, isn’t he? He’s stocky.”</p>
      <p>Asked how he thought Mr Johnson would perform in the ring against Mr Corbyn, he said: “I’d put me money on (Mr Johnson) because I think everyone wants to see Corbyn get knocked out.</p>
      <p>“He’d definitely win by a KO (knockout) – first round KO.”</p>
