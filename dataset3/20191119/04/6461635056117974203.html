      <h4>With Ivan Rakitic looking to leave Barcelona in 2020, there are five possible rosters into which he would fit well and be successful.</h4>
      <p>Barcelona midfielder Ivan Rakitic has fallen out of favour since Frenkie de Jong arrived at the club during the summer. The Croatia international was once an indispensable player under Ernesto Valverde’s setup, but he has barely featured for the Blaugrana this season despite playing well when given a chance by his manager.</p>
      <p>Talking to the media some time ago, the former Sevilla midfielder confessed that he needs to play his football regularly and would be willing to switch pastures in order to do so in spite of being aware that Barca is the best club to do so. There has been no positive change in the situation and Rakitic looks set to head elsewhere and could move in January itself.</p>
      <p>We take a look at five potential destinations for the star Barcelona man:</p>
      <h3>Juventus</h3>
      <p>Juventus have a crammed up midfield, but Maurizio Sarri does rely heavily on his central players and thus has shortlisted Ivan Rakitic as an option to be signed in January. The Old Lady of Turin is famous for landing experienced players for relatively cheaper costs and with the resources that they have, they could easily afford to accommodate Rakitic and his demands.</p>
      <p>If Rakitic ends up joining the defending Serie A champions, he could add some Italian medals into his trophy cabinet after winning every possible trophy in Spain during his time with Barcelona and Sevilla. Juventus are also looking to win the Champions League and after three successive knockouts at Barca, Rakitic may want to try his luck at a second European Cup in Italy.</p>

      <h3>Inter Milan</h3>
      <p>Inter Milan are looking like a major side after several years of being in the bottom of European football by their standards. Antonio Conte’s appointment has probably been the biggest turning point for the Nerazzurri, but the newly emerging players like Romelu Lukaku, Lautaro Martinez, Diego Godin and Milan Skriniar also deserve a huge amount of credit.</p>
      <p>Antonio Conte has managed to deploy his flamboyant attacking style of football at the San Siro but lacks a creative midfielder who could give his side a bit of a push. Ivan Rakitic could be the missing piece in the Italian giants’ puzzle and may help them in ending Juventus’ dominance of nine years on the Serie A front should he join them in January’s transfer window.</p>
      <h3>AC Milan</h3>
      <p>AC Milan is one of Europe’s heritage clubs but it is currently having one of the worst seasons in its history. Having already sacked a manager this season, Stefano Pioli has managed to steady the ship for the seven time European Cup winners. As a major squad revamp awaits them, Rakitic could be a great addition to AC Milan’s setup.</p>
      <p>The Croatia international could be remembered for helping Milan turn things around if he does sign for them and the club manages to go on an upward surge. If not, then Rakitic could have the privilege of playing for a royal and historic club. However, if the player is interested in moving to this side of the San Siro remains doubtful given Milan’s form.</p>

      <h3>Atletico Madrid</h3>
      <p>Atletico Madrid have reportedly vested interest in Ivan Rakitic over a potential move in the upcoming calendar year as per several claims.</p>
      <p>The Wanda Metropolitano could be a superb destination for the Croatia international as he would be considered precious and untouchable in the squad by Diego Simeone because of his defensive work rate in addition to the attacking quality.</p>
      <p>Los Rojiblancos are not doing extremely well in the league but are always a force to reckon under Diego Simeone and more so after their squad rebuild from last summer. Rakitic may want to try out a slightly difficult challenge by competing against Spain’s two biggest clubs before potentially calling it a day on his footballing career after a year or two.</p>
      <h3>Manchester City</h3>
      <p>Manchester City are going to part company with David Silva at the end of the 2019/20 campaign. El Mago has been terrific for the Citizens since checking-in some years ago and will surely be a difficult fixture to replace. The Premier League’s defending champions are reportedly interested in bringing Rakitic into their roster as a replacement for David Silva.</p>
      <p>By signing for Pep Guardiola’s side, Rakitic could get the chance to play and possibly even win the world’s most competitive league. Settling into the squad won’t be too difficult for the Croat because City play a similar style as Barcelona. Additionally, their squad depth would ensure that Rakitic has the chance to feature in four competitions at once but also have sufficient rest and not be overworked like he would be under Valverde.</p>
      <p>Where do you think Ivan Rakitic will succeed the most after leaving the Camp Nou?</p>
