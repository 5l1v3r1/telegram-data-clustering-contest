      <p>NEW DELHI: <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Sri-Lanka">Sri Lanka</a> has often produced great bowlers with unorthodox actions, with Lasith Malinga being a prime example. The latest in that list to have perplexed onlookers is 21-year-old spinner <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kevin-Koththigoda">Kevin Koththigoda</a>.</p>
      <p>Hailing from <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Galle">Galle</a>, Koththigoda's action has been compared to that of former South African spinner <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Paul-Adams">Paul Adams</a> by his coach Dhammika Sudarshana. Koththigoda is playing for Bangla Tigers in the Abu Dhabi T10 league and a video of his perplexing action has gone viral on social media.</p>

      <p>Among the many things is that the action is being called 'frog in a blender 2.0', based on the nickname that was given to Adams.</p>
      <p>However, Koththigoda has said that he never saw Adams bowl while growing up and took a look at his action only when comparisons were made.</p>
      <p>"From the beginning I was bowling like this, and I never changed through under-13, 15, 17 and 19 cricket in Sri Lanka," he is quoted as saying by The National.</p>
      <p>"In the beginning, I was playing with a tennis ball with my dad. From there I began to play cricket, and I have kept this action since," he said.</p>
