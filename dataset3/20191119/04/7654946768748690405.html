      <p>A Pennsylvania mother has been arrested and accused of murdering her 32-year-old quadriplegic daughter, according to reports.</p>
      <p>Yelena Nezhikhovskaya, 63, has been charged with third-degree murder, false reporting and drug delivery resulting in death, <a href="https://6abc.com/philly-woman-charged-with-killing-quadriplegic-daughter/5705655/">according to WPVI-TV</a>.</p>
      <p>In December 2018, police were called to a home in Philadelphia, and 32-year-old Yulia Nezhikhovskaya was declared dead at the scene, <a href="https://www.fox29.com/news/police-mother-charged-with-killing-32-year-old-quadriplegic-daughter">Fox 29 reported</a>, citing police.</p>
      <p>The body was taken to the medical examiner’s office for further investigation.</p>
      <p>The ME did not immediately respond to Fox News’ request for information on the cause of death. However, WPVI-TV reported it was found to be drug intoxication and a homicide. The outlet said that according to sources, Yelena gave her daughter a lethal dose of medication and alcohol.</p>
