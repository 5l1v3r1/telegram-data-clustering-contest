      <p>A statement from the Yemen Houthi movement claimed that on Monday evening an element of their “Coast Guard” had seized three vessels, one of which was described as the Saudi-flagged vessel Rabigh 3, as they had entered Yemeni territorial waters without prior notice, according to Houthi media broadcaster Al Masirah TV.</p>
      <p>The Houthi “Coast Guard” reportedly stated that the crews of the captured vessels at first did not respond to their call on International Channel 16.</p>

      <p>The seized ships were taken to the port of As-Saleef and legal procedures have been undertaken regarding violations of maritime law, the media broadcaster reported.</p>

      <p>Riyadh has led a small Arab coalition in fighting the Houthis in Yemen since March 2015. The conflict has seen over 10,000 civilians killed and many millions displaced by destruction, disease and famine.</p>
