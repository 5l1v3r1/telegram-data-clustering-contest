      <h1>Republican lawmaker says Democrats can 'only cry wolf so many times' on impeachment</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T04:29:35+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 04:29</time> by <a rel="author">Charles Creitz</a></address>
      <p>House Intelligence Committee Member Chris Stewart, R-Utah, said Democrats have been "crying wolf" on alleged wrongdoing on the part of <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump">President Trump</a> for a long time and "you can only cry wolf so many times, and eventually people will quit listening."</p>
      <p>Stewart told "<a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/media/fox-news-flash">The Ingraham Angle</a>" on Monday that the cratering television ratings for the impeachment inquiry hearings help prove the point.</p>

          <b>OFFICIAL'S TESTIMONY ON TRUMP-UKRAINE CALL CONFLICTS WITH TOP DIPLOMAT'S STORY</b>

      <p>Stewart said there has not been much in the way of gripping testimony by the witnesses thus far.</p>
      <p>Last week, State Department official George Kent, diplomat William Taylor Jr. and ex-Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch testified before Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and his committee.</p>
      <p>Host Laura Ingraham said 13.8 million people tuned in to the first day of hearings -- which featured Taylor and Kent -- while more than 19 million tuned in to see former FBI Director James Comey testify before Congress in 2017.</p>
      <p>Late Tuesday, it was learned that State Department official David Holmes’ testimony on a newly revealed phone call between Trump and Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland seems to conflict with that of Taylor at last week's lead-off <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry">impeachment hearing</a>.</p>

      <p>Taylor had testified that he had just learned about the July phone call this month.</p>
      <p>But Holmes’ <a href="https://warroom.org/2019/11/16/holmes-testimony-contradicts-amb-taylors-claims-over-trump-investigations-call/">timeline of events</a>, according to a written statement from his closed-door interview, seems to depart from <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/first-public-impeachment-hearing">Taylor’s</a> -- saying he notified Taylor of the call shortly after it happened.</p>
      <p>Holmes, who is the political counsel at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine, told congressional investigators that he was at a restaurant in Kiev on July 26 when Sondland spoke to Trump over the phone—just one day after Trump’s now-infamous July 25 phone call with Ukrainian <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/marie-yovanovitch-standing-ovation-dc-jazz-club">President Volodymyr Zelensky </a>when he asked for investigations into the Bidens and 2016 election meddling.</p>
