      <blockquote>Clarkson kicks off each episode with “Kellyoke,” a segment where she covers a recent or classic song by artists that her audience feels a connection to. “Kellyoke” covers include “Juice” by Lizzo, “Think” by Aretha Franklin, Taylor Swift’s “Delicate” and “Alone” by Heart, among others. After the performance, Clarkson interviews a panel of guests that includes a mix of celebrities and everyday people. Some notable celebrity guests include Chance the Rapper, John Cena, Ellen DeGeneres, Jennifer Garner, Kevin Hart, Dwayne Johnson, John Legend, Jay Leno, Jason Momoa, Tyler Perry, Blake Shelton and others. She has also performed duets with multiple guests, including Garth Brooks, Cyndi Lauper and Ben Platt.<br/>Segments range from doing the first ever original “American Idol” reunion show, featuring Simon Cowell, Paula Abdul and Justin Guarini, to giving back to everyday community heroes. In her first week on air, she helped to transform the lives of music teachers across the country with a Universal Studios “Tram of Dreams” surprise. “Good Neighbor,” “Rad Human” and #WhatI’mLiking segments shine the spotlight on veterans, foster care and local heroes beating the odds.</blockquote>
