      <p>Talking about his <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/prep">prep</a>, the actor told <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Bombay-Times">Bombay Times</a>, “Getting the character of a runner right was challenging physically, as there were a lot of races. However, when it comes to running, I had some prior practice, as I used to represent my school in athletics. A part of my fitness regime has included running, too. So it wasn’t something I felt I had to learn.” He further added and said, ''But boxing is something I have never done in my life. It is very demanding, and is not only about fitness, but also your endurance.''</p>
      <p>Directed by <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Rakeysh-Omprakash-Mehra">Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra</a>, the film is slated to release on 2nd October 2020.</p>
