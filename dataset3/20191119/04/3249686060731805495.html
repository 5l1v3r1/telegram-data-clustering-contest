      <p>On November 19,<b> Girl's Day</b> member/actress <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/hyeri">Hyeri</a> sat down for a roundtable interview about her recently ended tvN drama, '<b>Miss Lee</b>'. </p>
      <p>After discussing her role in 'Miss Lee', her character's comparison to her days on '<b>Reply 1988</b>', and more, Hyeri also answered questions about her boyfriend, actor <a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/ryu-joon-yeol">Ryu Joon Yeol</a>. The two stars have been dating publicly since August of 2017. </p>
      <p>Hyeri began,<i> "Even though we're both busy, we're still seeing each other well. I see my [Girl's Day] members and my boyfriend on an equal ratio,"</i> causing laughter. She then added,<i> "To be honest, it's not that I don't expect questions like this during interviews, but I do feel a little disappointed when I talk about it and the attention falls solely on that side. Even though I spend an hour answering many questions, the headlines end up very differently? That's what occurred to me."</i></p>
      <p>Hyeri continued, <i>"I think my boyfriend also enjoyed watching my character <b>Sun Shim</b>. Whatever feedback or advice he discusses with me, I take it to heart. Sometimes, he can be harsh and critical, and sometimes, he can be warm and kind."</i></p>
      <p>Did you watch Hyeri in tvN's 'Miss Lee'?</p>
