      <h2>A portable cabin-type structure is to be erected at Glasgow’s £842m Queen Elizabeth University Hospital because A&amp;E department can’t cope.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T04:30:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Vivienne Aitken, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/vivienne-aitken/</a></address>
      <p>Scotland's super-hospital is installing a temporary building to treat patients because its A&amp;E department is swamped.</p>
      <p>Electricity for the structure is being installed near the ­ambulance parking area at ­Glasgow’s £842million <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/queen-elizabeth-university-hospital">Queen Elizabeth</a> University Hospital and it is expected to be in place before Christmas.</p>
      <p>Casualty waiting lists at the hospital have consistently been among the worst in the country.</p>
      <p>Last week, just 69.2 per cent of patients were seen and treated within the target four hours – 25.8 percentage points below the 95 per cent standard.</p>
      <p>A hospital source said: “The SNP’s state-of-the-art hospital is putting in a portable cabin to relieve A&amp;E, which can’t cope.</p>
      <p>“Ambulance crews will still have to go to casualty, then porters will move patients back and forth, whatever the weather.”</p>
      <p>Five years ago, the Daily Record told how a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/hospital-bed-crisis-worsens-old-4939143">condemned Portakabin</a> used for storing broken furniture was turned into a casualty department ­overspill during a beds crisis.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>The Victoria Infirmary in Glasgow had been using the building as a junk storeroom and it was infested with ­cockroaches until pest control workers were called in just before Christmas in 2014.</p>
      <p>It was cleaned, painted and opened to patients following criticism of accident and ­emergency patients being kept overnight on hospital trolleys.</p>
      <p>Patients thought they had seen the last of this kind of temporary treatment centre with the opening of the new <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/health-bosses-warned-pigeon-infestation-18802181">QEUH</a> in April 2015.</p>
      <p>Now, the new hospital appears to be unable to cope with the number of patients.</p>
      <p>Opposition MSPs condemned the decision and Lib Dem health spokesman Alex Cole-Hamilton said it showed the NHS was “held together with sticky tape and elastoplast”.</p>
      <p>He added: “The QEUH is supposed to be a state-of-the-art, world-leading hospital but there is no ­development spec which shows people have a higher demand on the NHS in winter.</p>
      <p>“I hope at the very least this will do something to reduce waiting times.</p>
      <p>“The staff deserve our sincere thanks for making do with these inadequate arrangements.”</p>

      <p>Monica Lennon, Labour’s health ­spokeswoman, said: “There’s something far wrong if ­Scotland’s flagship hospital is so overcrowded that portable cabins are being ordered.</p>
      <p>“This would be a backwards step for patients and staff.</p>
      <p>“Glasgow’s QEUH is the largest hospital campus in Europe and should be able to cope.</p>
      <p>“Scottish Labour demanded a public inquiry into infection-related deaths at the troubled hospital but the problems are widespread and growing by the day. Patients deserve better than this.”</p>
      <p>And Conservative health spokesman Miles Briggs said: “This is yet another example of this building not being fit to address the need of the ­community it serves.</p>
      <p>“Patients having to use these cabins does not meet their ­expectations of service at a state of the art hospital.”</p>

      <p>A spokeswoman for Greater Glasgow and Clyde Health Board said the introduction of the “temporary modular building” was part of national plans to improve waiting times this winter. She said it would allow those with minor ­injuries “to be seen and treated in a ­dedicated space”.</p>
      <p>She added: “We will evaluate the impact this has on the ­emergency ­department waiting times to consider if we should seek to make this a permanent unit in the future.</p>
      <p>“Our Minor Injuries Units at Stobhill, Victoria and Vale of Leven Hospitals are the best place for the rapid treatment of minor injuries, including sprains and cuts and broken bones.</p>
      <p>“For minor ailments, patients can self-care or visit a pharmacy.”</p>
