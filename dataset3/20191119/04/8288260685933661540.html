      <h3>Cutrone's agent slams speculation</h3>
      <p>Patrick Cutrone’s agent has quashed rumours the striker could be about to quit Wolverhampton Wanderers.</p>
      <p>Italy striker Cutrone, who scored twice for his nation’s under-21s in a 3-0 win over Iceland on Saturday, only joined <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> from AC Milan in the summer.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old signed a four-year contract at Molineux and has already become a hugely popular figure with supporters.</p>

      <p>Cutrone has scored just two goals in 19 appearances, but most of those outings have come from the bench under <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/nuno-espirito-santo">Nuno Espirito Santo.</a></p>
      <p>And <a href="https://www.primocanale.it/notizie/la-sampdoria-punta-cutrone-trattativa-avviatissima-con-il-wolverhampton-213374.html">rumours have surprisingly surfaced</a> to suggest Cutrone could return to Italy with Sampdoria reportedly interested.</p>
      <p>But Cutrone’s agent, Donato Orgnoni, has laughed off those claims and insists his client is only focused on life at his new club.</p>
      <p>“We’ve never thought of leaving Wolves,” <a href="https://www.sampnews24.com/esclusiva-cutrone-samp-lagente-nega-rimane-in-inghilterra/">he told SampNews.</a> “I don’t understand why certain news comes out. He remains in England one hundred percent.”</p>

      <h3>Olmo hasn't closed the door...</h3>
      <p>Dani Olmo is among the many names to have been linked with Wolverhampton Wanderers in the past 12 months. </p>
      <p>The Dinamo Zagreb midfielder, 21, scored on his international debut for Spain on Friday night to add to his growing reputation. </p>
      <p>His stock has risen considerably this season due to his involvement in the Champions League with Dinamo and <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> aren’t the only club to have been linked.</p>

      <p>Olmo’s boyhood club Barcelona are also said to be keen on re-signing him due to his fine form in Croatia, which has seen him net 19 goals in 31 league matches. </p>
      <p>And a return to the Camp Nou appears to be Olmo’s preferred destination.</p>
      <p>“I hope I can come back, but we've just started the season really well, we're doing well in the Champions League,” <a href="https://www.sport-english.com/en/news/barca/spains-dani-olmo-barcelona-return-i-am-not-closing-any-door-7738601?fbclid=IwAR3huQ0ekJRNsSDLhyLEpenTyniWSseoKREqXq5Q-uaSXsa_tP7lqXmaMW0">Olmo told SPORT.</a> “There are two games left and we depend on ourselves to get through. There's a lot of work to be done.”</p>
      <p>Pressed on where his futures lies, Olmo added: "I don't close the door on any club, but I'm a Dinamo player. What happens with Dinamo, we will see.”</p>
      <h3>United want a Loader Danny</h3>
      <p>Manchester United have joined the race to sign Reading star Danny Loader, <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11661/11864054/manchester-united-considering-danny-loader-bid-with-several-premier-league-clubs-also-interested">according to Sky Sports News.</a></p>
      <p>Loader, 19, is reportedly a target for a host of Premier League clubs with Wolverhampton Wanderers known to be among his admirers.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> made a move to sign Loader late in the summer transfer window and agreed a deal before Reading pulled the plug before the deadline.</p>
      <p>And Wolves continue to keep tabs on Loader with his contract due to expire at the end of the current season.</p>

      <h3>Where do Wolves most need to strengthen in January?</h3>
      <h4>0+ VOTES SO FAR</h4>
      <p>Goalkeeper Defence Wing-back Midfield Up front</p>
      <p>But they face competition for his signature with Sky suggesting United have joined the race for the attacker.</p>
      <p>Speaking shortly after his move to Wolves fell through in August, Loader said: "Everyone knows a Premier League club tried to sign me in the transfer window, but it wasn't to be.</p>
      <p>"I'm very ambitious, my dream is to play on the biggest stage and you never know when these opportunities will come around again."</p>
