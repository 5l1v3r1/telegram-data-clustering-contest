      <p>Argentina’s Lionel Messi scored an added-time penalty to salvage a 2-2 draw with Uruguay as they twice came from behind in an entertaining friendly match in Israel on Monday.</p>
      <p>Argentina, now unbeaten in six games since a disappointing Copa America, had the better of the early play but fell behind in the 34th minute when Edinson Cavani stabbed home from close range after a nice build-up by Luis Suarez and Lucas Torreira.</p>
      <p>The crowd in Tel Aviv cheered Messi throughout and it was the forward who helped Argentina draw level in the 63rd.</p>

      <p>However, Suarez gave Uruguay the lead again in the 69th when he scored with a powerful 20-metre free kick that flew past goalkeeper Esteban Andrada into the top corner.</p>
      <p>But the last word went to Messi who, three days after he missed from 12 yards against Brazil, made no mistake by coolly side-footing home from the spot to secure a deserved draw.</p>
      <p>The fixture was the last international for both teams before they begin their 2022 World Cup qualifying campaign in March.</p>
