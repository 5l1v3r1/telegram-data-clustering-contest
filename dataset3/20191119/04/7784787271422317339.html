      <p>By swapping first round selections with the Crows, it results in the Giants moving up two spots in the draft order. GWS will now make a selection in the draft before matching a bid on Green – which could come as early as Sydney’s Pick 5.<br/><br/><i>Foxfooty.com.au</i> understands Melbourne is not expected to bid on the Patrick Cripps clone, favouring West Australian Luke Jackson with their Pick 3.</p>
      <p>Green averaged 23.8 disposals and eight clearances during the Under 18 Championships for the Allies.</p>
      <p>The Giants may need to go into deficit to match Green’s bid in future drafts, given their next three selections after Pick 4 are Picks 40, 59 and 60.</p>

      <p>Adelaide currently holds Pick 6, 23 and 28 — linked with Vic Metro MVP Fischer McAsey and Vic Country forward Sam Flanders for their first selection.</p>
      <p>“We saw the opportunity to maintain a top-six pick in a fairly even draft while accumulating more stock in the future as a massive positive for the Club,” Adelaide list manager Justin Reid said.</p>
      <p>“Our strategy is focused on rejuvenating our playing list through the draft and having the ability to secure more elite talent next year with an additional first round pick is an exciting one.”</p>
      <p>Clubs can continue to trade picks until November 22.</p>
