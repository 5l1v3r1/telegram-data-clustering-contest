      <p>A day after giving birth to a litter of cubs, white tigress Diya is showing symptoms of recovery, the Chhatbir zoo management said Monday. However, according to the zoo management, the next one week is very crucial for the<br/>cubs.</p>
      <p>“Among carnivores in wild, the survival chances of newly-born cubs in one litter is 50-50 per cent and in the captivity, it is 70 per cent. In captivity, the risks of infections, low immunity are much higher. We are monitoring the activities of Diya and her cubs through night vision CCTV cameras. The cubs haven’t opened their eyes,” Field Director, Chhatbir Zoo, M Sudhagar, said.</p>
      <p>“Diya started showing the symptoms of recovery. For providing her rich proteins, we added chicken in her diet<br/>with beef,” the field director added.</p>
      <p>A caretaker, who was associated with making the pre-delivery arrangements, said, “Before the delivery, Diya was shown video clips of recently delivered cubs on the wall of her dark enclosure about the delivery. Three clips were arranged from Rajkot Zoo in Gujrat.”</p>
      <p>A team of three veterinary doctors with a bunch of caretakers is making all necessary arrangements for the diet of Diya.</p>
      <p>The veterinary doctors have added multivitamin calcium supplementation syrup in the diet of Diya for the cubs, which are completely depending on the mother-feed.</p>
      <p>The white tigress was also born at Chhatbir zoo in 2013. Dolly, a tigress, had mothered a litter of three cubs.<br/>Out of three, two — Diya and Lakshy — are at Chhatbir zoo. The third one was shifted to another zoo.</p>
