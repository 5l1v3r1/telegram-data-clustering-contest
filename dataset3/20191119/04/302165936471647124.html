      <p>PUTRAJAYA, Nov 19 — Bus rapid transit (BRT) systems could be introduced in Kuching and Johor Baru, Transport Minister Anthony Loke said today.</p>
      <p>He said he met the Sarawak Transport Minister Datuk Lee Kim Shin and the Iskandar Regional Development Authority (IRDA) on this.</p>
      <p>“I was made to understand Sarawak is looking to develop their BRT system in Kuching. I just had a meeting with Sarawak transport minister yesterday. so one of the initiatives that they had proposed at the state level initiated by state government is to have a BRT in Kuching.</p>
      <p>“And of course in Johor Baru, the authority of Iskandar (Malaysia), IRDA, is developing the BRT system as well in JB. So I think these are the two tangible projects as far as BRTs are concerned,” he told reporters after officiating the BRT Conference in the Pullman Hotel, here today.</p>
      <p>Both representatives from Sarawak and Johor state governments attended today’s conference hosted jointly by Volvo Bus Corporation, Technology Depository Agency (TDA) and Prasarana Malaysia Berhad.</p>
      <p>Loke said there have been requests, but no plans to add or upgrade the BRT system in the Klang Valley.</p>
      <p>“As for KL, even though the BRT is proposed as well previously. As for now we, have not made any firm decision yet,” he said.</p>
      <p>Currently, the only BRT system in Malaysia is the 6km, seven station exclusive elevated guideway in Sunway and Subang Jaya in Selangor operated by Prasarana.</p>
      <p>On a separate matter, Loke said the government is still seeking better and more sustainable public transport in Malaysia through collaboration with companies.</p>
      <p>He said this included replacing inefficient buses with less polluting and electric variants.</p>
      <p>Previously, Loke announced that the ministry will acquire 500 electric buses to replace the ageing fleet in the Klang Valley in an effort to provide a more environmentally friendly transport system.</p>
