      <p>The Coast Guard has suspended a search for a missing 40-year-old man off Honokaa.</p>
      <p>The Coast Guard and Hawaii County firefighters launched a search for the man on Thursday. He was reported missing at about 6:35 p.m. Thursday.</p>
      <p>Two men were harvesting opihi when a wave swept them offshore, according to a Coast Guard news release. One man managed to swim back to shore and made contact with their friends who were searching for them when they failed to return by a set time.</p>
      <p>The fire department rescued the man from the shoreline while the Coast Guard and other fire crews continued the search for the 40-year-old man.</p>
      <p>The search spanned 2,011 square miles until the Coast Guard suspended its search at dusk Sunday.</p>
      <p>The assets involved in the search included the HC-130 Hercules plane, cutters Walnut and Ahi and MH-65 Dolphin helicopter. The Hawaii County Fire Department’s helicopter and ground crews were also involved in the search.</p>
      <p>“We extended our condolences to his friends and loved ones during this trying time,” said Petty Officer 2nd Class Casey Connors, a Sector Honolulu watchstander.</p>
      <p>The 40-year-old man was last seen wearing a red long-sleeve shirt with camouflage pants and black backpack. Anyone with information is asked to call the Sector Honolulu Command Center at 842-2600.</p>
