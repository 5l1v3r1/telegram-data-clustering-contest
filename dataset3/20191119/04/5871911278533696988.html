      <h1>WWE 'Monday Night Raw' Results (11/18): Triple H And NXT Invade, WWE Championship Match Adds Stipulation, More</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T04:31:24+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 04:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thesportsdaily.com/author/tinamiller87/" target="_blank">Tina Miller</a></address>
      <p>The <i>Monday Night Raw</i> go-home show to <i>Survivor Series</i> kicked off with Becky Lynch in Boston. She called out Bayley and Shayna Baszler, saying she doesn’t care about their “brand supremacy” and that she was ready for a fight. Instead of the <i>NXT</i> and <i>SmackDown</i> champions, she was answered by the IIconics. In fine IIconics fashion, they became whaling and complaining about being left off Team <i>Raw</i> for the traditional women’s <i>Survivor Series</i> match. Lynch tells them she is ready for a fight and that she wanted to fight both of them herself.</p>
      <p>However, Charlotte entered, saying the powers that be wanted them to tag together and also that she would be captain of team<i> Raw</i> against team <i>NXT</i> and team <i>SmackDown</i> in the women’s <i>Survivor Series</i> match. Samoa Joe then joined the commentary team.</p>
      <p>

      <p>After the match, Shayna Baszler, Jessamyn Duke, and Marina Shafir attacked The IIconics. Flair and Lynch returned to the ring, but were attacked as well. Lynch tried to go after them in the crowd, but was stopped by security.  However, Becky Lynch didn’t let that stop her. She punched one of the security guards before it went off to commerical break.</p>
