      <h1>Carson Wentz Asked Cameraman What Tony Romo Said About Reviewed TD Call Since ‘He’s Always Right’</h1>

      <p>Things have certainly changd since Tony Romo retired from the NFL.</p>
      <p>The former Dallas Cowboys quarterback and current NFL color commentator for CBS has been known to correctly predict play calls before they happened and he has become loved for it.</p>
      <p>Romo and play-by-play announcer Jim Nantz were at Lincoln Financial Field this past Sunday to call the Super Bowl LII rematch between the Philadelphia Eagles and New England Patriots for CBS. At the start of the second quarter, Eagles tight end Dallas Goedert seemed to cross the goal line before the Patriots forced a fumble, but it had to be reviewed.</p>
      <p>Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz wasn’t willing to wait, so he asked a cameraman what Tony Romo thought about it.</p>

      <p>Romo commented on air by saying he wished Wentz “would tell my wife that” he’s always right.</p>

      <p>It did end up staying a touchdown that put the Eagles up 10-0, but they wouldn’t score another point for the remainder of the game and lost 17-10.</p>
