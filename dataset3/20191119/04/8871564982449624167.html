      <h1>Movies go al fresco at Bangkok’s Open-Air European Film Fest</h1>

      <p>Kicking off next week, several venues in Bangkok will transform into temporary cinemas where movies are screened outdoor, tickled by Bangkok’s winter breeze — well, hopefully.</p>
      <p>After debuting last year, a second edition of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/notes/european-union-in-thailand/open-air-european-union-film-festival-2019/2433003046754762/?fbclid=IwAR24Ny29a69SjZO4_jMCwVu0u0Cnj9P8iQLG1nnHLXVclN2sqbIKfaXHuWM">Open-air European Film Festival</a> will return to the capital with 17 movies showing at eight venues around town including ambassadorial residences and <a href="https://coconuts.co/bangkok/news/chulas-hidden-downtown-park-wins-award-for-being-climate-forward/">CU Centenary Park</a>, a major urban eco park inside Chulalongkorn University. </p>
      <p>Among the highlights is a Danish film by Oscar and Palme d’Or-winning director Billie August, period romantic drama <b><i>A Fortunate Man </i></b>chronicles the life of an ambitious young man in the early 19th century who escapes religion to study engineering in Copenhagen. The film is based on the novel <i>Lykke-Per </i>by Nobel Laureate Henrik Pontoppidan, which is considered a Danish literary masterpiece.</p>

      <p>Liked <i>Rain Man</i>? Maybe you’ll dig Irish dramedy <b><i>The Drummer and the Keeper</i></b>, which shines the light on a friendship between a bipolar rock drummer and a teen with Asperger’s syndrome. </p>

      <p>Fans of late East German singer-songwriter Gerhard Gundermann shouldn’t miss <b><i>Gundermann</i></b>, a biopic circling around the man’s struggles with music and the former Soviet satellite state’s secret Stasi police. </p>
