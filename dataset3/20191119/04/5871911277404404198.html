      <h1>Rapid Recap: Celtics put the sunblock on Phoenix in low-key defensive grindfest</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T04:51:40+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 04:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thesportsdaily.com/author/liamarcuscousins/" target="_blank">Liam Green</a></address>
      <p>The Boston Celtics’ win streak ended yesterday afternoon in friggin’ Sacramento. So I imagine many folks had low expectations for a road back-to-back in Phoenix against Aron Baynes and the Suns (oh and also some promising, fledgling prospect you <i>might’ve</i> heard about named Devin Booker).</p>
      <p>Lockdown defense and solid play up and down the depth chart managed to avoid the start of a losing streak. Jayson Tatum led the way for Boston with 26-11-3-1. Kemba Walker had a “quiet” offensive game (19-2-5) in which he showed off his playmaking and defense instead of the bucket-getting we all know. Unfortunately Marcus Smart sprained his ankle midway through Q4, but not before another strong outing (17-3-4-2-1), the sort of well-rounded game that distinguished this grindy <b>99-85</b> win.</p>
      <p>The game did not begin auspiciously for the Celtics’ offense, to say the least:</p>

      <p>Defense was not exactly great either as the Suns’ motley crew of roleplayers—Kelly Oubre, Dario Saric, the aforementioned Baynes—seemed untroubled by the <s>wax on the rims</s> weird scoring issues of their opponents. The Celtics fanbase, meanwhile, voiced considerable displeasure with Enes Kanter, and the media had more measured questions:</p>

      <p>A combination of forced turnovers (3 steals!) and continued offensive aggression on Boston’s part got them back in it, chipping away at and eventually overtaking Phoenix’s lead at the quarter’s end, <b>26-22</b>. Cool things like this got them there:</p>

      <p>They kept the lead going—but only just, and coach was displeased by the execution:</p>

      <p>We interrupt this program to comment on OUBRE MICROAGGRESSIONS:</p>

      <p>Red’s Army can confirm at this time that Oubre did this, and it was both funny <i>and</i> made Oubre look heeeeeeeelllllllllllaaaaaa tryhard.</p>
      <p>Despite the Suns’ best efforts, their worst tendencies—a pronounced proclivity for turnovers, a weak frontcourt aside from Baynes and the suspended DeAndre Ayton—began surfacing. The Celtics parlayed this into a 21-4 run and took control. LET’S GO TO THE TAPE:</p>

      <p><b>57-42 </b>Cs at the half. Should we thank GRANT? I mean, us at WCT are going to pretty much regardless, but there is factual basis for it:</p>

      <p>For half of the third quarter, it seemed like the Celtics got their chutzpah in place and were just toying with the Suns:</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Some of this was gamesmanship:</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Despite some resistance in the form of intermittent nice plays by Booker, Baynes, Oubre and Tyler Johnson, the third ended with Boston firmly in control, <b>80-65.</b></p>
      <p>The fourth started mostly the same, but then, because virtually Nothing Can Be Easy, this happened:</p>
      <figure>
        <iframe data-src="https://twitter.com/NBCSCeltics/status/1196638421198024710?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-embed-type="twitter-tweet" width="100%" height="0" data-service="Twitter" scrolling="no" nowide=""/>

      <p>Right ankle sprain. Didn’t return to the game, but sprains aren’t usually that serious. Ideally he misses no more than two games; unfortunately, the next two are contests the Celtics badly need him for.</p>
      <p>It quite honestly might have been a series of Brad Wanamaker plays—a stepback triple followed by a nice pass to Kemba for a layup—that truly daggered this game (although in blowouts, the “dagger” can come at like, the 6:13 mark.) Beyond some playing-out-the-string play, it was decided, and the Celtics pulled off a defensive-driven win against a team that, unlike the past few years, was no pushover.</p>
