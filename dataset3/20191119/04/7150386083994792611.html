      <p>A British multi-millionaire has returned to non-league football, buying a new club Romford Town, sacked its coaching staff and appointed himself manager.</p>
      <p>Glenn Tamplin, a 47-year-old businessman, acquired his wealth in steel. And this is not his first stint with a football club. In December 2016, he bought Billericay Town where he was also the manager leading them to FA Cup first round and bought ex-premier league stars Paul Konchesky, Jermaine Pennant and Jamie O’Hara.</p>
      <p>Tamplin left the club in September this year following abuse directed towards his family.</p>
      <p>Now, he’s back with a different challenge which he describes as a ‘hobby’ to avoid boredom. “The money I wasted on the big names I got in will never happen again,” said Tamplin of his time with Billericay.</p>
      <p>He added, “I could’ve got involved at Macclesfield or Welling but I like a challenge – I had to go somewhere with potential, that was lower than where I went before because I need to do it bigger than I’ve done before. I’ve reached all my goals – when you reach your goals if you get bored it’s dangerous, so I need a hobby.”</p>
      <p>He became manager last Tuesday and has since let go long-serving Romford boss Paul Martin.</p>
      <p>“I went and watched Romford lose 5-1 last weekend and I didn’t see any heart or desire, there were only maybe two players that looked like they cared,” he told <i>BBC Sport</i>. “Paul’s a better manager than me but I’ve got the connections and the deals were being done as long as I was looking after and managing the players. The minute I get to the National League I’ll step down [as manager] because then I couldn’t do what others do, I know my limits.”</p>
      <p>Romford is an eight-tier club and is currently sitting at the bottom of the standings.</p>
      <p>Tamplin promised supporters free drinks for his first game in charge of the club. However, his era began with a 2-3 defeat to Coggeshall Town.</p>
