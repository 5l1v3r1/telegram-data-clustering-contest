      <h1>Samsung chases Apple’s $50bn-a-year lead in services</h1>
      <h2>South Korean tech group eschews content and pins hopes on 5G and connected devices</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T04:00:31+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 04:00</time> by <a rel="author">Edward White</a></address>
      <p>Samsung, the world’s largest smartphone maker, wants to emulate Apple’s success in building a $50bn-a-year services business as the rapid growth of smartphone sales begins to tail off.</p>
      <p>The South Korean company, which has never reported any revenue from services, is planning to move into services after heavily investing in software over the past four years.</p>
      <p>“Now we are at the stage where we are trying to package these major software investments into meaningful customer experiences,” a senior executive said to the FT at the company’s campus at Suwon, south of Seoul.</p>
      <p>Samsung’s search for growth away from its hardware divisions comes as analysts pencil in annual increases in the smartphone shipments of only 1 to 2 per cent for the foreseeable future.</p>
      <p>It has yet to reveal precisely what new “customer experiences” it hopes to monetise, with executives saying that opportunities will only become clear with the wider adoption of the latest technology.</p>
      <p>“We have a wave of new technologies coming, they are very precise: cloud-based service delivery, advanced connectivity, large-scale connectivity done fast with 5G, and [artificial] intelligence. These things, we believe, open a completely new space for the next 10, 20 years,” said the Samsung executive.</p>
      <p>Samsung believes it can take advantage of its existing 1bn customer accounts and expand the use of SmartThings, a platform allowing people to control and monitor electronics devices in their homes or office from their smartphone.</p>
      <p>The platform, acquired in 2014 for a reported $200m, can connect to about 5,000 different devices, from fridges and vacuum cleaners to security cameras and sensors, and has about 45m active users. Samsung hoped that its voice assistant Bixby, a competitor for Siri or Alexa, would be a way for consumers to control devices, but it has so far failed to win widespread adoption.</p>
      <p>“First we need to have a good a product that people use, then you get scale, then you make money. Not the other way around, which is a common mistake. So the timeframe for scale is [the] next two to three years, and in that timeframe we envisage service innovation opportunities,” the executive said.</p>
      <h3>Making money</h3>
      <p>While noting there was “little transparency” about Samsung’s plans, Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Creative Strategies, a US tech research firm, suggested the company might opt for a revenue sharing model whereby it takes “a chunk” of a transaction fee from a partner that supplies services via the SmartThings platform, rather than customers subscribing to Samsung services directly.</p>
      <p>Ms Milanesi pointed, as an example, to an existing tie up between Mastercard and Samsung which enables consumers to order groceries directly from a Samsung refrigerator that has a display and internet connection.</p>
      <p>“There is definitely opportunity for them. I don’t think it is going to be an overnight sensation, I think it is going to take time,” she said.</p>
      <p>Samsung also sees growth stemming from more conventional services for both consumers and enterprises, linked to products in health, cyber security and payments.</p>
      <p>But the company has tried and failed for years to make money out of music, video and virtual reality services. Some industry watchers believe the gap with Apple is a symptom of a longstanding and chronic problem in the South Korean group: a failure to expand beyond its history of manufacturing to software-based businesses despite years of investment.</p>

      <p>Sanjeev Rana, a Seoul-based analyst with CLSA, noted that half of Apple’s 900m iPhone users around the world pay for services. That brought in a record $12.5bn in the third quarter — edging above one-third of iPhone sales — and netting $46.3bn over the previous 12 months.</p>
      <blockquote>All of a sudden they [Samsung] are at the epicentre of every single major critical tech component and critical ecosystem . . . Even Apple doesn’t have that reach<cite>Bob O’Donnell, chief analyst at Technalysis Research</cite></blockquote>
      <p>“I feel like there is a lack of seriousness [from Samsung]. The company needs to have a decent services portfolio that customers would want to pay for and then market it properly across the different set of devices that they have,” Mr Rana said.</p>
      <p>Samsung’s earlier attempts in cloud-based services and music streaming have demonstrated the group was “trying to copy Apple but didn’t put serious thought or effort into monetisation”, he added.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Apple shows no signs of slowing. Neil Cybart, an analyst at Above Avalon, estimated Apple’s music streaming service could crack the 100m customer mark by late 2022, while new television streaming and gaming units will reach 55m and 30m paying subscribers, respectively.</p>
      <p>Even for “wild card” offerings like gaming, Apple has a big advantage because it can give its own services “prime real estate in the App Store” which has 500m visitors every week, Mr Cybart noted in a recent report.</p>
      <p>Samsung argues that its future does not lie in content. Incumbents such as streaming giants Netflix and Spotify were “partners not competitors”, the Samsung executive said.</p>
      <p>“Some of the services businesses are very mature — like content — nobody can bet on the future but I don’t know of any plans for us to go and do this kind of stuff because there are companies who are doing it very well,” he said.</p>
      <p>Rather than competing, the company sees opportunities in expanding relationships with Google, whose Android service is used as the main operating system for Samsung smartphones, as well as Microsoft, with whom the company recently struck a broad alliance to boost interoperability between its phones and Windows PCs.</p>

      <p>Bob O’Donnell, chief analyst at Technalysis Research, a US firm, said by opening its devices and platforms to other global tech giants, just as technology was changing with advances such as 5G, Samsung had now taken a “singular central position”, but it remained the “$64,000 question” whether it would be successful in translating that into new revenue streams, beyond selling more devices.</p>
      <p>“They are positioning themselves now by working with Microsoft on the Windows PC side and Google on the Android side and Intel and Qualcomm on chips — all of a sudden they are at the epicentre of every single major critical tech component and critical ecosystem . . . Even Apple doesn’t have that reach,” he said.</p>
      <h3>Cultural questions</h3>
      <p>Sea-jin Chang, a professor at the National University of Singapore who has written extensively about Samsung’s history, was likewise sceptical of Samsung’s chances of success.</p>
      <p>“Samsung is a very typical manufacturing company. They make money by selling hardware. Software has never been a major part of their business,” he said. The problem, Mr Chang said, stemmed from the South Korean education system focused on rote learning rather than students “asking good questions”.</p>
      <p>“There is a fundamental limitation in software, it is not just Samsung’s problem but in the Korean economy.”</p>
