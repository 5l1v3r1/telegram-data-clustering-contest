      <p>John Abraham who was starring in back-to-back patriotic movies has some really interesting projects in his casket. This time the list does not stick to only patriotic films but the list comprises of some different genres, however, one of them is Attack. A while ago, the actor announced his next film with the debutante director Lakshya Raj Anand's film Attack which also stars Jacqueline Fernandez. Well, now we have learned that the film is actually a two heroine project and with this, the film will see another new actress and she is Marjaavaan actress Rakul Preet Singh.</p>
      <p>According to the Pinkvilla report, a source was quoted saying that as this film is a two-heroine project, the makers took the film to Rakul who was their first choice for the role. As both the roles are really powerful and action-oriented, Rakul has shown the green signal to the project.  Once the final modalities are worked out, the team will make an official announcement of the same soon. The source was quoted by the portal, “The team was scouting for two good looking actors who can also perform and do stunts really well. It's then that they took the film to Rakul Preet Singh. She was their first choice for the role."</p>
