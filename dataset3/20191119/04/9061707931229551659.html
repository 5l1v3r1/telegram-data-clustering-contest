      <h1>Phillip Cocu's likely transfer targets revealed as midfielder's Derby link is dismissed</h1>
      <h2>The Rams return to Championship action this weekend when Preston North End visit Pride Park Stadium</h2>

      <h3>TARGET MEN</h3>
      <p>Suggestions ranging from goalkeeper to a free-kick specialist emerged when we asked fans where they would like to see <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county">Derby County</a> strengthen in the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>Most fans mentioned centre back, and that is no surprise given what has happened to <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/derby-county-richard-keogh-sacked-3531705">Richard Keogh</a> and also the injury concern over <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/derby-county-dealt-fresh-injury-3520371">Matt Clarke,</a> who looks set for a spell out with the knee damage he suffered in the defeat by Nottingham Forest.</p>
      <p>So, centre-back, possibly more than one, is the priority, I understand.</p>
      <p>Here are other areas of the team Cocu is likely to look at.</p>

      <h3>INVESTMENT LATEST</h3>
      <p>Mel Morris says the challenge to succeed at Derby County remains a "constant quest".</p>
      <p>Derby's owner and chairman, who bought the Rams in 2015, has invested tens of millions of pounds in the club and he has been searching for new investment.</p>
      <p>That investment could be in place by the end of the year, <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/">DerbyshireLive</a> understands.</p>

      <h3>ACOSTA NO GO</h3>
      <p>Wayne Rooney's former team-mate at DC United, <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/derby-county-transfer-news-acosta-3546853">Luciano Acosta</a> , is not a transfer target for Derby County .</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old attacking midfielder claimed in an interview in Argentina that Rooney, who joins Derby as player-coach in January, had told him to join him at Pride Park.</p>
      <p>There was a suggestion that Acosta is "waiting for the call" from Derby over a potential move, but DerbyshireLive understands the player is not on their 'wanted list'.</p>

      <h3>DEFENDER WANTED</h3>
      <p>Former Derby County defender Efe Ambrose is reportedly wanted by two clubs in Scotland</p>
      <p>The experienced centre-back signed for the Rams on a short-term deal in February as a free agent, shortly after his contract at Hibernian has expired.</p>
      <p>Ambrose was signed as defensive cover to centre-backs Richard Keogh and Fikayo Tomori, but left <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/derby-county-defender-up-there-3547692">Pride Park</a> in the summer without a single first-team appearance to his name.</p>
