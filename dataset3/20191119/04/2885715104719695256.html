      <p>Coming to Ranu Mandol’s defence, a Twitter user spoke against trolls targetting the viral sensation for applying so much makeup. She wrote, “Everyone making fun of #RanuMandal please remember that one can’t change their looks,but you can certainly choose to speak logically &amp; with kindness whilst judging her. Being in the public eye &amp; under a scanner while she herself is a WIP ain’t easy for an adult. Cut her some slack.”</p>
      <p>Another person took on the trolls saying, “I don’t understand why everyone is making fun of #RanuMandal ‘s makeup. It’s not like she did it herself or knows anything about it.”</p>
