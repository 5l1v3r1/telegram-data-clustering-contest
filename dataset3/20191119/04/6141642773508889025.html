      <p>Steve Clarke believes the Scotland players are slowly getting to know him while he adapts to international management.</p>
      <p>The former West Brom and Kilmarnock boss took over from Alex McLeish in May, after the Scots had started the Euro 2020 qualifying campaign with a shock 3-0 defeat in Kazakhstan and an expected win over lowly San Marino.</p>
      <p>Scotland moved into third place behind Belgium and Russia with a 2-1 win over Cyprus in Nicosia on Saturday but have no chance of qualifying automatically for the finals, albeit they will get an opportunity through the Nations League play-offs in March.</p>

      <p>Ahead of the final Group I fixture against Kazakhstan at Hampden Park on Tuesday night, Clarke revealed how the Scotland camp have gelled in the past few months.</p>
      <p>He said: “I am still adapting. I am still learning, I am still working on it. I am learning more and more all the time.</p>
      <p>“This second game of the two-game period becomes a time when you don’t have much time at all on the training pitch so you have to do more in the meeting rooms, more in the videos.</p>
      <p>“A little more classroom work than practical work. So I am learning all the time.</p>

      <p>“Slowly but surely you start to get familiarity.</p>
      <p>“The players start to understand me, they maybe see that I am not quite as dour and difficult to get on with as maybe some people imagine.</p>
      <p>“In a club situation, that kind of bond develops over four, six, eight weeks. You get it very quickly.</p>
      <p>“But in this situation, you take a bit longer because you only have short periods of time together. But the team spirit is good.”</p>
