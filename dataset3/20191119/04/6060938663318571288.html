      <p>PANAJI: Bala Devi Ngangom is confident she can impress Rangers FC officials and become the first Indian woman to play in a top-tier European football league.</p>
      <p>Among India's most decorated footballer, the Manipur Police striker has more than 100 goals to her credit in all competitions and has been top scorer in almost every league or Cup she has taken part. In Scotland, though, she knows it won't be easy, but believes in her ability to achieve a major breakthrough for Indian women.</p>
      <p>"I'm not putting unnecessary pressure on myself. I have a fair idea of women's football in Scotland, have watched a few matches to prepare too, but I'm treating this as another tournament. I am confident that I can make a mark," said Bala, who was the star of last season's Indian Women's League (IWL) where she top scored with 26 goals in seven matches.</p>
      <p>Bala, 29, will fly to Glasgow on Tuesday and spend a week in the Scottish capital where she will be assessed Rangers Women's coaches. Rangers have just completed their engagements in this season of the Scottish Women's League and finished fourth after a solitary goal win over Spartans at Ainslie Park on Sunday. The Rangers men's team is coached by Liverpool legend <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Steven-Gerrard">Steven Gerrard</a> and they recently inked a partnership with <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/bengaluru-fc">Bengaluru FC</a>.</p>
      <p>"The women's football season runs (in Scotland) from February to November. If Bala gets the nod, she will sign a year-long contract and we have assurances that the work visa would not be a problem," said Anuj Kichlu, the player's representative.</p>
      <p>According to the rules in UK, a player should feature in at least 75% of her country's competitive international games over the last two years, while the country, on average over those two years, should have been in the top 50 of the <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/FIFA">FIFA</a> rankings. Indian women are ranked 58 at the moment.</p>
