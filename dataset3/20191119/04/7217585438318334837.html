      <h1>Twitter officially implements its political advertising ban</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T04:00:57+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 04:00</time> by <a rel="author">Shereesa Moodley</a></address>
      <p>After announcing that it will <a href="https://memeburn.com/2019/10/twitter-banning-political-advertising/">ban political advertising</a> on its platform a few weeks ago, Twitter has officially updated its policies to reflect the change.</p>
      <p>According to the company, advertisements that reference content such as political parties, candidates, referendums, legislation and elections will be banned on the platform.</p>
      <p>“Ads that contain references to political content, including appeals for votes, solicitations of financial support, and advocacy for or against any of the above-listed types of political content, are prohibited under this policy,” the company said on its <a href="https://business.twitter.com/en/help/ads-policies/prohibited-content-policies/political-content.html">website</a>.</p>
      <p>The ban also applies to advertisements by political candidates, parties and government officials as well.</p>
      <p>As an exception, however, news publishers may run political ads as long as their reporting remains objective. This means that the content on Twitter cannot be “for or against” political entities.</p>
      <p>“We have made this decision based on our belief that political message reach should be earned, not bought,” Twitter reiterated.</p>
      <p>The ban comes after the company also announced changes to its policies regarding <a href="https://memeburn.com/2019/11/twitter-deep-fakes-policy/">deep fake content</a> on the platform.</p>
