      <p>The Toilet Board Coalition (TBC), a business-led platform, has organised a three-day Global Sanitation Economy Summit at the Conrad over sanitation issues. “To accelerate the rate of change towards universal sanitation, business has a unique role to play. Business has solutions to bring to the global sanitation crisis,” said Cheryl, executive director and CEO, TBC.</p>
      <p>“In 2016, we started our toilet accelerator programme, to bring new innovations to sanitation in low income countries. Over the past four years, from 2016 to 2019, we’ve supported a number of innovative businesses that have given us interesting insights as to where business can really play a role in giving universal access to sanitation. In doing so, we have estimated that the sanitation economy in India will be worth $62 billion by 2021. What we mean by sanitation economy is not just toilets and waste management but transformation of unaffordable public cost into sustainable business opportunities,” said Cheryl.</p>
      <p>“Costs have always been the burden of governments, so to accelerate the pace of change, we found, firstly, sanitation can become a consumer space. Toilets are becoming sanitation centres that are providing access to consumers in terms of water, feminine hygiene products and health information. Many of these models have been pioneered in Pune, which is why we’re here. The other area where we saw value was in resources. The world is now constrained for water, energy, nutrients and agriculture…,” added Cheryl.</p>
