      <p>Hawaii island fire investigators suspect a fire at a vacation rental home in Volcano over the weekend was intentionally set.</p>
      <p>Firefighters responded to the blaze at 99-2056 Pukeawe Circle just after 7:20 p.m. Sunday. The fire department said guests arrived at the short-term vacation rental and saw a small amount of smoke emanating from structure.</p>
      <p>Firefighters gained entry and found furniture piled up in the living room and in flames, the fire department said.</p>
      <p>Crews brought the fire under control at 7:55 p.m. and extinguished it five minutes later.</p>
      <p>No injuries were reported.</p>
      <p>Battalion Chief Matthias Kusch said there were strong indicators that the blaze was “maliciously set.” He declined to provide additional details due to the ongoing investigation.</p>
      <p>Aside from some drywall damage in the interior of the vacation rental, the structure itself was saved.</p>
      <p>Damage was estimated at $57,000.</p>
      <p>Police also responded to the site to investigate.</p>
