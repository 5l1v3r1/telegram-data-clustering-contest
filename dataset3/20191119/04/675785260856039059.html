      <h1>Yaya Toure names Man United midfielder Nemanja Matic as toughest Premier League opponent</h1>
      <h2>Toure became a hero at Manchester City after winning three Premier League titles and an FA Cup during his eight seasons at the Etihad Stadium</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T04:09:02+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 04:09</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Milne</a></address>
      <p>Manchester City fans' favourite Yaya Toure said Nemanja Matic was his most difficult opponent during his time in England for both <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> .</p>
      <p>Toure, who is now at Chinese side Qingdao Huanghai, joined City from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> in 2010, and made a total of 316 appearances from then until his departure in 2018, winning a total of three Premier Leagues, one FA Cup, two League Cups and a Community Shield during a hugely successful spell at the club.</p>
      <p>He came up against some of the very best Premier League midfielders, but said Matic- <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/nemanja-matic-pondering-january-transfer-20828289">who is being linked with a move away from Old Trafford</a> after struggling for first-team minutes this season- was the toughest of the lot.</p>

      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/sport/yaya-toure-i-went-to-manchester-city-to-make-them-great-people-were-laughing-at-the-start-pq9kggpqn?wgu=270525_54264_15741358385471_e2c35e0c5c&amp;wgexpiry=1581911838&amp;utm_source=planit&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_content=22278">the Times</a> Toure said: "Nemanja Matic was complicated. He's not quick but he's so strong, clever.</p>
      <p>"All the rest of the opponents, because I always looked at them carefully before games, I get their weakness."</p>
      <p>Toure joined City before they became one of the very best teams in the world, and admitted he needed some persuading before signing from Barcelona.</p>
      <p>He added: "I was on the phone with (chief executive) Garry Cook. He promised me he was going to bring players to help me do great things at City.</p>

      <p>"I said, ‘Sign David Silva first, and I will come.’ And Silva was saying, ‘Sign Yaya first and I will come!’ I said to Silva, ‘Sign! I am not going to run off!’</p>
      <p>"He didn’t believe me because I was at Barcelona, one of the top teams in the world. But it was time for change. Kolo told me to come. I have to listen to him."</p>
      <p>Toure left City to join Greek side Olympiacos last year, but made just five appearances before moving to China.</p>
