      <h1>Boris Johnson will 'never debate' Nicola Sturgeon over the future of Scotland</h1>
      <h2>The Tory leader spoke to the Record and said he would never go head to head with his SNP rival on TV and also ruled out IndyRef2 as long as he remains as Prime Minister.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T04:30:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Torcuil Crichton, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/torcuil-crichton/</a></address>
      <p>Cowardly <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> will never debate <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/nicola-sturgeon">Nicola Sturgeon</a> head to head over the future of Scotland, he has declared.</p>
      <p>The Tory Prime Minister also ruled out a second independence referendum as long as he remains in Downing Street – regardless of the outcome of the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/general-election">General Election</a> in Scotland.</p>
      <p>As the SNP lost a court case to be involved in tonight’s crucial television showdown between Johnson and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a>, the Tory leader ruled out ever taking up the First Minister’s challenge.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister spoke to the Daily Record just as the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/snp">SNP’s</a> unsuccessful case in the High Court to be included in the ITV debate was coming to a conclusion.</p>
      <p>He hid his fear of a confrontation with the SNP leader with the excuse that <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/nicola-sturgeon">Sturgeon</a> could never be a contender for Downing Street.</p>
      <p>Johnson said: “I am devoted to campaigning for election in the whole of the UK and I am afraid Nicola Sturgeon, all she can do, is support a coalition of chaos.</p>
      <p>“Alas, although she can be very influential on our politics, she has no seat in the House of Commons nor can she be prime minister.</p>
      <p>“The candidate to be prime minister who Nicola Sturgeon would support is <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a>. That is why he is the appropriate person to debate.”</p>
      <p>Johnson declared himself to be “fit as a butcher’s dog” and ready like a “coiled spring” to take on Corbyn in tonight’s ITV debate, when the two leaders will be interviewed by Julia Etchingham and then allowed to cross examine each other.</p>
      <p>Other party leaders will respond in one-to-one interviews on Tuesday evening an hour later after I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here!</p>
      <p>But asked a second time if he would go in the ring for a similar bout with Sturgeon, Johnson turned down the offer.</p>

      <p>He said: “Once Nicola Sturgeon takes leadership of a party in Parliament and is a serious contender to be prime minister of the UK, that would be the appropriate moment.</p>
      <p>“The appropriate thing in this election is for me to contest the debates with whoever theoretically could be the next prime minister.”</p>
      <p>Sturgeon, who has made it clear she will never stand in a Westminster election, threw down the gauntlet to Johnson earlier this month when news of the leaders’ debate emerged.</p>
      <p>Speaking at an independence rally in George Square, Glasgow, on November 2, Sturgeon said: “My message to Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson is this –why are you so scared to debate me? I’ll debate you anytime and anywhere and it will be for you to justify why Scotland can’t have a choice on our own future.” </p>
      <p>But Johnson said: “Until today, I had no idea that it was even being suggested.”</p>
      <p>The PM was unequivocal that there would be no second independence referendum while he remains in Downing Street.</p>
      <p>He said: “I’m ruling it out. It is a bad idea. People don’t think referendums are proving to be brilliantly healing political devices in our country.”</p>
      <p>Johnson added: “A lot of people feel the referendum in 2016 now needs to be honoured whether they voted to leave or remain, as many people in Scotland voted. A lot of people feel we should we need to get on with it.</p>
      <p>“And there’s such a fantastic opportunity for our country, if we can just get it done, get Brexit done and move on. That’s why I am actually full of optimism about the union and about our prospects.”</p>
      <p>Johnson stuck doggedly to the frayed line that the Scottish referendum was, in Sturgeon and Alex Salmond’s words, a “once in a generation event”.</p>
      <p>He said: “I simply say this because I made it very clear that the people of Scotland were told emphatically in 2014 that this was a once in a generation event, that they would not be driven to the polls again. I think we should abide by that.”</p>
      <p>The Tory leader added that he was sensitive to the independence arguments and that devolution had been a success.</p>
      <p>But he said felt passionately about keeping the Union together, rejecting the suggestion that he could be the last PM of the UK because of Brexit.</p>
      <p>Johnson said: “I understand people’s feelings and I respect these feelings but the promise in 2104 was very important. I think we shouldn’t underestimate the importance of Scotland to the union.</p>
      <p>“When I see investments in Rosyth, in Govan, massive success for this country, the environment summit in Glasgow next year, which will be wonderful for the whole UK, and the £9 or £10billion that goes to Scotland each year as result of membership of the union.</p>
      <p>"It really grieves me that this should be pulled apart.”</p>
      <p>He added: “I will continue to make my case that our country as a whole is better served by staying together, I believe that passionately. The UK has made a fantastic contribution to the world in the last 300 years, we should be proud of it.</p>
      <p>“I think the devolution has been a success. It’s been wonderful that people should feel proud of their of their Scottish identity – that’s a fantastic and powerful thing. I don’t want that to come at the expense of the UK, which is also a great thing.</p>
      <p>“That’s where I am on this and I think there is a balance to be struck. I think we need to get into a mind-set where we can get both things to work together.</p>
      <p>“People on both sides of the argument do get that. We do need our national debate to become less acrimonious. I think feelings have been running high and the best way forward is to get Brexit done and move forward.”</p>
      <p>Johnson insisted he was being well received on the campaign trail, despite avoiding the public on his visits to Scotland.</p>
      <p>He said: “I have been in Scotland a lot, I have met loads of people and had a pretty good reception.”</p>
