      <h1>The latest version of Denuvo, used in Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, has been cracked in three days</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T04:59:57+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 04:59</time> by <a rel="author">John Papadopoulos</a></address>
      <p>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is the latest game that uses the Denuvo anti-tamper tech. And from the looks of it, the game has been cracked in just three days. This basically means that hacking groups are currently able to crack the latest version of Denuvo in less than a week.</p>
      <p>Now as always, we strongly suggest supporting the games instead of pirating them. Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order is an amazing single-player title that does not have any microtransactions. As such, gamers should at least show their support to what Respawn has crafted.</p>
      <p>It will also be interesting to see whether EA and Respawn will remove Denuvo now from the game. After all, this anti-tamper tech is only hurting the legitimate owners at this point.</p>
      <p>Not only that, but we are curious to see whether there will be any performance differences between the Denuvo and the Denuvo-less versions. As we wrote in our <a href="https://www.dsogaming.com/pc-performance-analyses/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-pc-performance-analysis/">PC Performance Analysis</a>, we experienced CPU/memory limitations on our Intel i9 9900K at 1080p. My guess is that the DX11 API is causing these optimizations issues and not Denuvo. Still, it will be cool to be able to test a Denuvo-free version of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order.</p>
      <p>Before closing, let me remind you that we do not allow links to pirated content. If you share such a link, you will be banned.</p>
