      <h1>Boris Johnson bottles out of debating Nicola Sturgeon on future of Scotland</h1>
      <h2>The Prime Minister would rather take on Jeremy Corbyn than head north of the border.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T04:30:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Record View, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/record-view/</a></address>
      <p>Like the cowardly lion in the Wizard of Oz, <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/opinion/boris-johnson-ignores-campaign-trail-20895228">Boris Johnson</a> has yet to find his courage when it comes to Scotland.</p>
      <p>The Tory leader is quite willing to go into the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/snp-lib-dems-lose-high-20909038">TV arena against Jeremy Corbyn</a>. With a ten-point lead in the opinion polls he maybe thinks he cannot lose, even if Corbyn does manage to land a blow or two.</p>
      <p>Johnson might have underestimated the Labour leader but he has the measure of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/scottish-leaders-debate-go-ahead-20894014">Nicola Sturgeon</a> - he’s scared stiff of her.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>His flat refusal to take her on in a debate on the future of Scotland, on the future of the UK in fact, is a yellow mark against him</p>
      <p>Hiding behind the lame excuse that Sturgeon is not a Westminster politician, therefore not a candidate to be Prime Minister, does not wash. The <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/tory-immigration-plans-hostile-scotland-20882215">future of Scotland</a> is completely linked to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/farage-pact-tories-killer-20863229">Brexit</a> and to the type of parliament we get in a month’s time.</p>
      <p>It is crucial that all the issues be debated, and only fair that everyone gets the same TV platform to put their views across.   </p>
      <p>Closing down debate in a democracy is not a good look for anyone, particularly a Prime Minister. Neither is to be seen to be running scared of a confrontation with another party leader.</p>
      <p>Put ‘em up, Mr Johnson. Get in the ring.</p>
      <h3>NHS needing treatment</h3>
      <p>The Scottish government should be grateful we are heading into a Westminster election, not a Holyrood poll.</p>
      <p>If we were focusing on the domestic record of Nicola Sturgeon’s administration, the deteriorating state of the NHS would be at the centre of the campaign.</p>
      <p>As we revealed last week, 10-year-old cancer patient <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/heartbroken-mum-reveals-child-cancer-20889570">Milly Main</a> died after contracting a water infection at Glasgow’s super hospital.</p>

      <p>Her mum Kimberly said she believes “100%” that the bacteria came from the hospital’s water supply.</p>
      <p>Police are also investigating the death of a three-year-old boy at the same hospital.</p>
      <p>It has now emerged that Queen Elizabeth is installing a temporary structure to treat patients because its casualty department is swamped.</p>
      <p>At the other end of the M8, the new <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/health/cancer-patients-agony-claims-sick-20850518">Sick Kids hospital in Edinburgh</a> is empty amid concerns over ventilation.</p>
      <p>Health Secretary Jeane Freeman will address MSPs this week on the spiralling crisis in our health service. She should put NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde into special measures and end its culture of incompetence and cover up.</p>
      <h3>Stepping down</h3>
      <p>Strictly legend <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/celebrity/len-goodman-strictly-affairs-i-6864648">Len Goodman</a> has revealed he is to waltz off into the sunset after the Dancing With the Stars finale.</p>
      <p>The popular telly judge has been much loved on both sides of the Atlantic for more than a decade.</p>
      <p>Len is quitting the show for good but looking back he says it has been a ball.</p>
