      <p>From what we know so far, Half-Life: Alyx is a new VR game. This project started as a VR exploration game, and only targets VR devices. As such, there won’t – most likely – be a “<i>traditional</i>” version that will support mouse and keyboard.</p>
      <p>Half-Life: Alyx targets a March 2020 release and Valve plans to create more games after it.</p>
      <p>Stay tuned for more!</p>
