      <p>Prime Minister Shinzo Abe surged back to power seven years ago, pledging to bolster the nation’s defenses in response to a growing threat from China and aiming to amend the pacifist Constitution.</p>
      <p>Now on track to become Japan’s longest serving prime minister, Abe has kept his first promise. But the second remains elusive.</p>
      <p>That means Japan, which U.S. President Donald Trump has criticized over what he called an “unfair” security alliance, still faces limits on acting as a full-fledged American ally.</p>
      <p>Trump has even suggested changing the two-way security pact that underpins the alliance, at a time when China is flexing its military muscle in the region and North Korea is pursuing nuclear and missile programs.</p>
      <p>During Abe’s watch, Japan has boosted defense spending by 10 percent after years of decline, expanding the Self-Defense Forces’ ability to project power abroad. In a historic shift in 2014, his administration reinterpreted the Constitution to expand the legal scope of the SDF’s overseas operations.</p>

      <p>But the conservative leader’s inability to cement his legacy by revising the pacifist Article 9 of the Constitution symbolizes persistent public wariness about putting troops in harm’s way far from home and a fear of entanglement in U.S.-led wars.</p>
      <p>“For the Japanese people, Article 9 is a kind of Bible,” said Hajime Funada, a ruling Liberal Democratic Party lawmaker and former head of a panel on constitutional revision.</p>
      <p>The U.S.-drafted Constitution is seen by Japan’s conservatives as a humiliating symbol of defeat but by others as a brake on entanglement in foreign conflicts.</p>
      <p>For both sides, a revision would be hugely symbolic.</p>
      <p>According to a survey by NHK last week, voters gave the highest marks to Abe’s security and diplomacy policies. But an Asahi Shimbun survey earlier this year showed 64 percent opposed revising Article 9 while 28 percent favored amendment.</p>
      <p>Any constitutional amendment requires approval by two-thirds of both houses of the Diet and a majority in a national referendum.</p>
      <p>Abe, who quit in 2007 after a troubled one-year term, returned to office in December 2012. On Wednesday, he will exceed the record 2,886 days in office set by Taro Katsura in the early 20th century.</p>
      <p>Abe’s term as LDP leader ends in September 2021, and unless party rules are revised that will spell the end of his tenure.</p>
      <p>A five-year defense program unveiled last year allocates ¥25.5 trillion ($233.7 billion) in spending, a 6.4 percent rise over the previous five years, and includes refitting two warships as Japan’s first de facto aircraft carriers since World War II, a step toward a full-fledged blue water navy.</p>
      <p>A year after the Cabinet reinterpreted the Constitution, the Diet enacted laws that ended a ban on exercising the right of collective self-defense, or defending a friendly country under attack, if Japan’s survival is threatened.</p>
      <p>Such steps have further pushed the limits of Article 9, which, if taken literally, bans the maintenance of a standing military but has been stretched by previous administrations to allow armed forces for self-defense.</p>
      <p>“There is not much left of the postwar constraints,” said Richard Samuels, director of the Center for International Studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>
      <p>“It was under his (Abe’s) administration where the fastest progress was achieved to get more distance from Article 9.”</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, Abe has been forced by public opinion and the LDP’s less hawkish coalition partner, Komeito, to compromise.</p>
      <p>“Theoretically, Abe has laid the groundwork for Japan to take one step closer to … supporting the U.S. in combat for collective interests,” said Ellis Krauss, a professor emeritus at the University of California, San Diego. “But I don’t think Japan is near actually doing it.”</p>
      <p>Last month, Japan proposed sending Maritime Self-Defense Force vessels to Middle East waterways, not as part of a U.S.-led coalition to protect merchant ships but separately under a Japanese law allowing research and intelligence-gathering.</p>
      <p>Even that sparked calls for caution from liberal media.</p>
      <p>For Abe, revising the Constitution is a personal mission — one that eluded his grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, who quit as prime minister in 1960 due to a furor over a major revision of the Japan-U.S. security treaty.</p>
      <p>“It’s not only who he is, it’s who his grandfather was and it’s his base,” Samuels said. “It’s the view that says that … we are a different Japan, no longer bound and constrained by the defeat of World War II.”</p>
      <p>Abe has proposed writing the existence of the SDF into Article 9, far short of more drastic changes proposed previously by the LDP.</p>
      <p>Critics in his own party say that would be a waste of political capital for little gain, although experts note an amendment could open the door to future, bolder changes.</p>
      <p>Abe appears unlikely to abandon the cause.</p>
      <p>“Abe’s fundamental philosophy is nationalism and without a change in Article 9, there can be no independence from the (U.S.) Occupation regime,” said Yoshihide Soeya, a political science professor at Keio University. “I think he’ll never give it up.”</p>
