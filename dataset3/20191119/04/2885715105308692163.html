      <p>The Queensland batsman was recently released by Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) ahead of the Indian Premier League (IPL) auction to be held on December 19. KKR roped him in IPL 2018 auction for a whopping Rs 9.6 crore and retained him next season.</p>
      <p>Lynn’s Maratha Arabians teammate <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/yuvraj-singh/">Yuvraj Singh</a> lauded the Australian for his destructive innings.</p>
      <p>“He is someone I have seen in the IPL. He has given some great starts to KKR. I really don’t understand why they have not retained him. I think it is a bad call, must send SRK a message on that. Chris was just outstanding today,” he told reporters after the game.</p>
      <p>Yuvraj did not play the game due to back spasm. The former Indian cricketer hopes to be fit before his team’s next game against Karnataka Tuskers on Wednesday.</p>
