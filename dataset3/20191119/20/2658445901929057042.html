      <h4>Ernest Nwokolo, Abeokuta</h4>
      <p>The new Police Commissioner in Ogun State, Edgal Imohinmi, on Tuesday vowed to flush out police officers whose conducts were not only attracting opprobrium to the Command, but also standing in the way of rebranding the force for effective crimes prevention and combating in the state.</p>
      <p>Imohinmi also assured that the upsurge in burglary cases in Abeokuta and its environs would be seriously tackled within a short time, and blamed the occurrence to inadequate personnel on ground to effectively man the residential areas and other strategic locations.</p>
      <p>The Police Commissioner who spoke in Eleweran, the Command’s Headquarters while addressing reporters, disclosed that he has established “Citizens Complaints Reports Centre,” with dedicated series of hotlines the public could call any time to report observed unprofessional and misconducts of officers and men of the Ogun state Police Command.</p>

      <p>He explained that Ogun under his watch would adopt a philosophy of community policing and partnership, which he noted, would ensure that the police do not lose the trust and confidence of the public.</p>
      <p>He said: “We are aware that we have bad edges among us: just like we have good ones, we have bad ones. So, we want to flush out bad ones out of the system. That is why I said that I am going to launch the Citizens Complaint Hot Center and am happy to inform you that I have set it up. It is a center opened 24/7 so as to report the activities of my men.</p>
      <p>“The purpose of this is to identify policemen and officers who don’t want to key into safety partnership. We need to create a society where crimes are brought to a tolerable level.</p>
      <p>“This can only be made possible through a community driven security network. And I want to make it clear that actions will be taken against erring police officer whose conducts contravene our philosophy of community policing.</p>
      <p>“If you see anyone who is misbehaving just call any of the numbers either in your local Egba dialect, English language, Hausa or Igbo language. I want to assure you that your complaint will be taken and actions will be carried out.</p>
      <p>“I want to assure you that I will sanction any erring member of this force. Any policeman or woman who asks you for money before your matter is taken, just call the number. If your right is being infringed by police, just call any of the numbers.”</p>
      <p>The Police boss also assured that he would soon embark on town hall meetings with communities in the states with a view to fostering police community relations, while Crimes Officers, Area Commanders and Divisional Police Officers have also been directed to increase police pin down points in their respective areas and divisions.</p>
