      <h1>BBC's Discworld Cast Expands With Gender-Swapped Lord Vetinari and More</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T20:11:34+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 20:11</time> by <a rel="author">Bea Caicoya</a></address>
      <p>The new <i><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/discworld/">Discworld</a></i> series <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/the-watch/"><i>The Watch</i></a> has found its Lord Vetinari, and her name is Anna Chancellor. She previously starred in <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/penny-dreadful/"><i>Penny Dreadful</i></a> as Claire Ives and <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/pennyworth/"><i>Pennyworth</i></a> as Doctor Frances Gaunt.</p>
      <p><i>The Watch</i>, based on Terry Pratchett's 41-book series, will be a fantastical police procedural that follows Ankh-Morpork's Nightwatch police force, led by <a href="https://www.cbr.com/game-of-thrones-richard-dormer-joins-bbcs-discworld/">Richard Dormer's (<i>Game of Thrones</i>) Captain Vimes</a>. In the books, Lord Vetinari is the Lord Patrician of the city, a Machiavellian politician with a grey moral code and a portentous intelligence who, despite being a soft tyrant, is also profoundly opposed to the return of a monarchic system.</p>

      <p>Vetinari is also Captain Vimes' boss and foil on many occasions, and one of the rare people who recognizes the captain's wasted potential. In the books, he's also a man, but as Vetinari's gender does not impact the plot in any way, it will be interesting to see what Chancellor brings to a character that conforms to a traditionally masculine archetype.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.bbcamerica.com/anglophenia/2019/11/casting-news-bbc-americas-the-watch-enlists-anna-chancellor-james-fleet-and-more">Other additions to the cast include</a> James Fleet (<i>Outlander</i>) as The Archchancellor, a wizard, magical advisor and the Head of the Unseen University; Ingrid Oliver (<i>Doctor Who</i>) as the Head of The Assassins’ Guild, Doctor Cruces and Ruth Madeley (<i>Years and Years</i>) as Throat, the city’s most talented snitch. Hakeem Kae-Kazim (<i>Dynasty</i>) will play Captain John Keel, former leader of The Watch and mentor to Sam Vimes, while Bianca Simone Mannie (<i>Homeland</i>) will portray Wonse, a wizard hopeful in waiting that is frequently underestimated.</p>
      <p><i>The Watch</i> is executive produced by BBC Studios’ Hilary Salmon (<i>Luther</i>) and Phil Collinson (<i>Doctor Who</i>). The series will have eight episodes, and it is written by Simon Allen (<i>Das Boot</i>). The series stars Richard Dormer, Anna Chancellor, Lara Rossi, Ingrid Oliver, James Fleet, Marama Corlett, Sam Adewunmi, Jo Eaton-Kent, Adam Hugill, Hakeem Kae-Kazim, Ruth Madeley, Bianca Simone and Ingrid Oliver. <i>The Watch</i> will premiere in 2020.</p>
