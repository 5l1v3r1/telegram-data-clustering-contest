      <p>The first government-run cannabis store in the Cariboo is set to open its doors next week in Williams Lake.</p>

      <p>“We are looking forward to opening a BC Cannabis Store in Williams Lake, as we continue our efforts to roll out our network of retail stores and service the province,” said Kevin Satterfield, director of retail operations, cannabis operations, Liquor Distribution Branch (LDB).</p>

      <p>Regular operating hours for the store in Williams Lake will be 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday to Thursday, 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays and 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Sundays.</p>

      <p>Kate Bilney, senior communications officer with the BC Liquor Distribution Branch, said the store will offer a range of products including dried cannabis flower, oils, capsules and pre-rolls approved by Health Canada.</p>
      <p>Edibiles, extracts and topicals will become available for retail sale later this year, she added.</p>
      <p>The store, meanwhile, will be staffed by about 15 employees, including a store manager, two assistant store managers and knowledgeable cannabis consultants.</p>
      <p>“Staff are committed to keeping cannabis out of the hands of youth and will employ a strict two-ID check for people who look under 30, which ensures only those over the age of 19 enter the store,” Bilney said.</p>
