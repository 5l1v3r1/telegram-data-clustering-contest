      <p>A road in Devon was blocked tonights after a spillage of fish.</p>
      <p>Footage was taken this afternoon (Tuesday, November 19) by Michael Bettell on the A385 at Rattery.</p>
      <p>The incident saw Culver Lane to Tigley turn-off shut in both directions and traffic was slowed almost to a halt.</p>
      <p>A spokesperson of Devon and Cornwall Police said at the time: “The spillage was reported at 4.35pm today.</p>

      <p>“A lorry has shed cargo of pallets and fish across the carriageway. Another truck is on its way to assist clear up.</p>
      <p>“Police are sorting traffic control.”</p>
      <p>An eyewitness said: “It was quite a big truck and it looked like the pallets had fallen out of the back of the wagon along with one of those mobile forklifts that fit on the back of a truck.</p>
      <p>“It appeared to be sardine sized fish all over the road.”</p>
      <p>The road reopened before 7pm.</p>
