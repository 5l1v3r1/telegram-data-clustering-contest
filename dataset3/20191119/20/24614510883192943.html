      <p><b>Alphabet</b> (NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/goog-stock-quote/"><b><u>GOOG</u></b></a>, NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/googl-stock-quote/"><b><u>GOOGL</u></b></a>) stock has broken out. Before a 1% decline on Monday, Alphabet stock was trading at an all-time high. At this point, GOOG seems to have a clear path toward becoming the fourth stock to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization.</p>

      <p>In this market, I’d bet on the stock hitting that milestone, with Alphabet following <b>Apple</b> (NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/aapl-stock-quote/"><b><u>AAPL</u></b></a>), <b>Microsoft</b> (NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/msft-stock-quote/"><b><u>MSFT</u></b></a>) and <b>Amazon </b>(NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/amzn-stock-quote/"><b><u>AMZN</u></b></a>) in the process. From there, however, the case becomes a bit trickier.</p>
      <p>Alphabet stock admittedly looks cheap on an earnings basis, particularly backing out its cash hoard. Its growth continues to impress, with <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/10/alphabet-earnings-hit-googl-stock/">third-quarter earnings</a> much stronger than GAAP accounting suggests. Fundamentally, the case for a sustainable $1 trillion valuation seems easy to make, particularly in a U.S. stock market trading at all-time highs.</p>
      <p>But there are risks. Admittedly, I’ve been <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/06/alphabet-stock-google-stock-below-1000/">too bearish</a> on Google stock in the past, and those risks may be manageable. Still, GOOG has some potential potholes to hit on its way to $1 trillion — and even after that mark — assuming it gets there.</p>
      <h3>Alphabet Stock Breaks Out</h3>
      <p>In retrospect, the huge gains in GOOG and GOOGL stock seem quite logical. In a low interest rate environment, investors still are looking to equities for returns. But there’s been obvious concern about valuations for growth stocks lately. Seemingly all of 2019’s <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/09/10-big-recent-ipo-stocks-go-uber-stock/">high-profile initial public offerings</a> have pulled back. The list of the worst-performing large-cap names of the past three months is full of stocks with big revenue growth but barely profitable or unprofitable businesses. That list includes <b>Pinterest</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/pins-stock-quote/"><b><u>PINS</u></b></a>), <b>Twitter</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/twtr-stock-quote/"><b><u>TWTR</u></b></a>), <b>Slack </b>(NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/work-stock-quote/"><b><u>WORK</u></b></a>) and <b>Uber</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/uber-stock-quote/"><b><u>UBER</u></b></a>), to name a few.</p>
      <p>So investors fleeing 10-year Treasurys that yield less than 2% are looking for safety. They’ve looked to Big Tech. AAPL stock has posted <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/11/historic-run-apple-stock-price-really-good-far/">a historic run</a>. MSFT stock continues to gain. And Alphabet stock, too, has rallied.</p>
      <p>Admittedly, market factors alone aren’t driving the gains. Second-quarter <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/08/alphabet-stock-advertising-enough/">earnings impressed</a>, as I wrote at the time. Third-quarter earnings looked disappointing from a headline standpoint. But Alphabet’s earnings are <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/03/understanding-googl-stocks-tricky-earnings/">difficult to decipher</a>, and the miss relative to Wall Street consensus was driven mostly by mark-to-market accounting of the company’s stakes in other publicly traded companies.</p>
      <p>That accounting aside, the quarter was strong. Operating income in the core Google business increased 13% year-over-year. Traffic acquisition costs for years had been rising faster than revenue, but that concerning trend has reversed. Long-held worries about Google’s ability to manage the shift away from desktops to mobile have been assuaged.</p>
      <p>And even at all-time highs, GOOG stock remains reasonably cheap. A forward price-to-earnings ratio just over 24 doesn’t seem that cheap in context.</p>
      <p>But Alphabet has roughly $140 per share in net cash. It’s losing close to $1 billion per quarter pre-tax on its “Other Bets” businesses, which include self-driving car startup <b>Waymo</b>. Back out the cash and the losses, and the forward price-to-earnings multiple is in the range of 20.</p>
      <p>For double-digit earnings growth, that’s probably an attractive multiple. It’s certainly cheap enough for investors to keep talking themselves into Google stock, just as they have AAPL and MSFT.</p>
      <h3>What Goes Wrong for GOOG Stock</h3>
      <p>Meanwhile, the GOOG stock chart looks bullish. Going back to early 2018, Alphabet stock had stalled out several times around the $1,260 level. The recent gains broke through that resistance, signaling a breakout. As Apple stock has shown, even a mega-cap stock can become a momentum play once resistance has broken.</p>
      <p>And it wouldn’t be at all surprising if Alphabet stock cleared the $1 trillion mark. In fact, with that chart in this market, it’d be more surprising if it didn’t. The one concern might be what happens from that point.</p>
      <p>After all, $1 trillion has been a troublesome level for the other three stocks that have broached it. AMZN stock <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/08/sweat-temporary-weakness-amazon-stock/">twice has pulled back</a> sharply from those levels. AAPL stock, before its recent rally, did the same. Only MSFT avoided the so-called <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/can-microsoft-break-the-trillion-dollar-curse-51556330191">“trillion-dollar curse.”</a></p>
      <p>Meanwhile, there’s still an underlying argument that Alphabet stock should be cheaper than a stock like MSFT, or even than the market as a whole.</p>
      <p>The shift to mobile still is modestly negative for advertising revenue. The duopoly of Google and <b>Facebook</b> (NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/fb-stock-quote/"><b><u>FB</u></b></a>) in online advertising is <a href="https://adage.com/article/digital/duopoly-loses-share-ad-spend/316692">starting to crack</a>. Amazon has become <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/09/advertising-move-needle-amzn-stock/">a real competitor</a> for advertising dollars and independent names like <b>The Trade Desk</b> (NASDAQ:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/ttd-stock-quote/"><b><u>TTD</u></b></a>) and <b>the Rubicon Project</b> (NYSE:<a href="https://investorplace.com/stock-quotes/rubi-stock-quote/"><b><u>RUBI</u></b></a>) are showing explosive growth.</p>
      <p>To be fair, these arguments have been made for years. Worries about mobile adoption, in particular, kept a lid on Alphabet stock at the beginning of the decade. Given that what was then Google stock was trading at around $300, in retrospect it’s obvious those fears were overblown. Digital advertising market growth should be large enough to make room for Amazon and buy-side platforms like The Trade Desk.</p>
      <p>But there’s one more concern I’d watch closely, particularly given that the run in GOOG stock suggests investors have largely brushed it off.</p>
      <h3>Are Regulators Coming for Alphabet?</h3>
      <p>The late-May lows from which Alphabet stock has rallied 29% were caused by a key piece of news. U.S. regulators were probing both Google and Facebook for antitrust valuations.</p>
      <p><i>InvestorPlace’s </i>Luke Lango presciently argued that investors should <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/06/buy-facebook-and-google-stock-on-antitrust-related-weakness/">buy the dip</a> in both stocks — and so far, he’s been right. FB stock itself has rallied over 20%. A potential multi-billion dollar fine wouldn’t be great for either company, but in the context of Alphabet’s $900 billion valuation, such a fine hardly represents an existential threat.</p>
      <p>That said, particularly at these levels, investors might be a bit too sanguine. The regulators currently investigating Google are part President Donald Trump’s business-friendly administration. A state-level investigation includes attorneys general from 48 states plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. That investigation, too, can’t be chalked up to partisan politics; it’s being led by the Texas attorney general, whose state too long has come down on the side of free enterprise.</p>
      <p>That state-level investigation reportedly is expanding into the company’s Android mobile operating system. And it follows fines (and required business model changes) levied by the European Commission in past years.</p>
      <p>Those fines obviously haven’t interrupted the gains in Alphabet stock. And it’s possible, as Lango argued, that U.S. investigations, too, will have a minimal effect.</p>
      <p>That said, a 2020 U.S. presidential election looms. Politicians on both sides of the aisle may well look to score points. And as May trading shows, it doesn’t take a political loss, but simply news of political risk, to impact Alphabet stock. That impact may be even larger if Alphabet indeed is the third stock trading with a market capitalization above $1 trillion.</p>
      <p>This isn’t to say that GOOG stock is a short, or that investors need to rush to sell. Rather, it’s a reminder that Alphabet stock might continue to look somewhat “cheap” for a while. Given underlying growth, that doesn’t mean the recent rally will end. But it might well mean that the rally will at the least slow down.</p>
