      <h1>Penn State TE Pat Freiermuth Addresses National Award Snub</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T20:24:51+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 20:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>Pat Freiermuth has drastically improved in his sophomore season for Penn State, however, it wasn’t enough to earn him a chance at winning the John Mackey Award.</p>
      <p>Each year the NCAA awards the John Mackey Award to the most outstanding tight end in college football. Freiermuth currently has 34 receptions for 424 yards and seven touchdowns.</p>
      <p>He was asked about not being listed as one of the semifinalists for the award. It’s apparent that he won’t let it affect his production moving forward.</p>
      <p>“An award doesn’t define who I am or who I am as a player,” Freiermuth said. “My focus right now is on Ohio State.”</p>

      <p>Despite getting snubbed this year, Freiermuth plans on winning the award at some point during his collegiate career.</p>
      <p>This would mean that he plans on staying at Penn State for another season, but he did admit he hasn’t thought about his future yet.</p>

      <p>Penn State is going to need a solid performance from Freiermuth when it faces Ohio State.</p>
      <p>While it’s no secret that Freiermuth would prefer to be a semifinalist for the John Mackey Award, the way he’s handling this situation should make head coach James Franklin proud.</p>
      <p>Freiermuth can prove how valuable he is on Saturday as the Nittany Lions hope to pull off the upset against the Buckeyes.</p>
