      <h1>The Outer Worlds patch includes a toggle option to increase the font size, more</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T20:06:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 20:06</time> by <a rel="author">Stephany Nunneley</a></address>
      <p>The latest patch for The Outer Worlds is available, and one of the takeaways is the ability to increase the font size.</p>
      <p>No one likes to squint, and thankfully, after applying <b>The Outer World</b>s patch you will no longer have to. Now, you will be able to increase fonts for conversation text, cinematic subtitles, bark subtitles, and terminal text thanks to a new toggle option.</p>
      <p>Patch 1.1.1.0 will also stop the game from crashing at a specific point when you reach Tartarus.</p>
      <p>Foliage on the Xbox One now has parity with that on PlayStation 4, and speaking of the latter, you will no longer experience muffled sounds on the console. For both consoles. the achievement/trophy for “It’s Not the Best Choice” will now pop correctly as well.</p>

      <p>Other changes listed in the patch notes are as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Prismatic Hammer has been rebalanced and no longer incorrectly uses the level multiplier as an exponent instead of a multiplier and will no longer do 10s of thousands of points of damage at a higher level. Now deals the damage it should have been dealing all along</li>
        <li>Existing Botched companion quests will have their status reset to Active allowing the player to add them to a party when leaving the ship in order to un-botch the quests unless the death occurred prior to unlocking the companion quest</li>
        <li>Fix for “Radio Free Monarch” where issues would happen when talking to Nayoka while having SAM in your party</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The patch is available on all platforms.</p>
