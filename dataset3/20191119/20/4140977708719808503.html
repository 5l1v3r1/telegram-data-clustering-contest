                      <p>“It falls to the Board to make the difficult decisions – this one made more so given the many memorable moments we have had with Mauricio and his coaching staff – but we do so in the Club’s best interests.</p>

                          <p>“Mauricio and his coaching staff will always be part of our history. I have the utmost admiration for the manner in which he dealt with the difficult times away from a home ground whilst we built the new stadium and for the warmth and positivity he brought to us.</p>
                          <anchor name="ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148">
                            <p>“I should like to thank him and his coaching staff for all they have contributed. They will always be welcome here. “We have a talented squad. We need to re-energise and look to deliver a positive season for our supporters.”</p>
                            <p>Pochettino joined Spurs in 2014 and brought them to the prominence after rebuilding the squad by bringing the stars like Harry Kane, Heung-Min Son and Dele Alli.</p>
                            <p>Meanwhile, the Argentine manager has been linked with several job offers but his future action is still remained to see, as he is yet to give a public statement after this. Whereas, as of now, Spurs is expected to have a caretaker manager for the time being.</p>
