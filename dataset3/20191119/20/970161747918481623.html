        <b>David Metcalfe (Matthew Wolfenden) was left horrified in Emmerdale last night when he learned that sex abuser <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/maya-stepney/">Maya Stepney</a> (Louisa Clein) was due to be released from prison. After informing Leyla Harding (Roxy Shahidi), the two became incredibly worried about how <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jacob-gallagher/">Jacob Gallagher</a> (Joe Warren-Plant) — who’d finally started to move on — would take the news.</b>
      </p>
      <p>After deliberating over what to do for the best, both David and Leyla took it upon themselves to inform Jacob about Maya’s release.</p>
      <p>After learning the news, Jacob seemed oddly composed about the whole thing. In fact, he brushed it off, and claimed he was going to go out to the cinema with Leanna (Mimi Slinger).</p>

      <p>David and Leyla were chuffed that Jacob was moving on with his life, but as Jacob headed off, it became rather apparent that he had other things on his mind.</p>
      <p>Later, Jacob the young man disappeared, as he attempted to track down Maya. While he ultimately failed in doing so, he did attempt to ring her and — as he did so —viewers saw Maya being released from prison.</p>

      <p>Seemingly ready for a fresh start, she deleted Jacob’s number from her phone and headed off — but as she did so, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/emmerdale-spoilers-paedophile-maya-stepney-pregnant-jacob-gallaghers-baby-11184198/">it was revealed that she’s pregnant</a>.</p>

      <p>Taking to Twitter, fans were quick to demonstrate their shock at the revelation:</p>

      <p>The twist was held back, and as of yet there’s no word on whether or not Louisa Clein will be returning — or if Jacob will find out about the baby.</p>
