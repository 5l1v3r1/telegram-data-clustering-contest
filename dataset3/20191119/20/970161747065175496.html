        <b>Kris Jenner couldn’t help but celebrate the fact that daughter Kylie Jenner sold a huge stake of her cosmetics empire for $600 million.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The momager bursted with pride as she discussed how <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/kylie-jenner-sells-cosmetics-company-share-600m-becoming-youngest-self-made-billionaire-11176988/">Kylie sold a 51% stake to beauty company Coty</a>, which own brands like CoverGirl and Max Factor.</p>
      <p>Speaking to CNBC’s Squawk Box, Kris spilled: ‘Yesterday was a really big day for Kylie and our team at Kylie Cosmetics,’ said the Keeping up with the Kardashian matriarch.</p>
      <p>‘[It was] truly a moment for our family to be proud. It’s kind of a crystallisation of all our work.’</p>
      <p>The 64-year-old insisted her make-up company is something she wants to be part of ‘for the rest of her life’, but at least now she’s $600 million richer.</p>
      <p>‘I think the goal is to just keep building Kylie’s existing beauty business into a global powerhouse brand. That’s the vision,’ the Keeping up with the Kardashians star continued.</p>

      <p>‘[Kylie] talks about [the business] all the time. Twenty years from now she sees herself doing this and maybe passing it down to her daughter [21-month-old Stormi]’.</p>

      <p>Besides a tweet confirming the sale and an official statement, Kylie has been keeping quiet on the matter on her Instagram.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old tweeted: ‘I can’t wait for all of the amazing things to come for @kylieskin and @kyliecosmetics! I’m excited to partner with @cotyinc to continue to expand my brands globally.. This is only the beginning!’</p>
      <p>She was named the world’s youngest self-made billionaire aged 21 after Kylie Cosmetics enjoyed record sales in 2018 thanks to its famous lip kits and eyeshadow palettes.</p>
      <p>Her statement read: ‘I’m excited to partner with Coty to continue to reach even more fans of Kylie Cosmetics and Kylie Skin around the world.</p>
      <p>‘I look forward to continuing the creativity and ingenuity for each collection that consumers have come to expect and engaging with my fans across social media.</p>
      <p>‘This partnership will allow me and my team to stay focused on the creation and development of each product while building the brand into an international beauty powerhouse.’</p>
