      <h1>Palestine ambassador 'welcomes' Ireland's commitment after US decision on Israel</h1>

        <b>The ambassador of the State of Palestine to Ireland has welcomed the Government's commitment, following a change of US policy on illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The administration of US President Donald Trump has declared that Israeli settlements in the West Bank are not illegal.</p>
      <p>This is a shift in decades-long US policy in the Middle East. It is feared the move could stoke tensions in the area.</p>
      <p>Following the announcement, the US government advised its citizens considering travel to Jerusalem, the West Bank or Gaza to "maintain vigilance".</p>
      <p>"Those opposed to the Secretary of State's announcement may target US govt facilities, interests and citizens", it warned.</p>

      <p>In response, Tánaiste Simon Coveney said: "Ireland strongly continues to support the agreed EU position on Israeli settlement policy.</p>
      <blockquote>"Expansion of settlements in Occupied Territory is illegal under international law."</blockquote>
      <p>Meanwhile the EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Federica Mogherini, said: "The European Union's position on Israeli settlement policy in the occupied Palestinian territory is clear and remains unchanged: all settlement activity is illegal under international law and it erodes the viability of the two-state solution and the prospects for a lasting peace, as reaffirmed by UN Security Council Resolution 2334.</p>
      <p>"The EU calls on Israel to end all settlement activity, in line with its obligations as an occupying power.</p>
      <p>"The EU will continue to support a resumption of a meaningful process towards a negotiated two-state solution, the only realistic and viable way to fulfil the legitimate aspirations of both parties."</p>

      <p>The ambassador of the State of Palestine to Ireland, Ahmad Abdelrazek, has welcomed Mr Coveney's affirmation that Ireland strongly supports the official EU position.</p>
      <p>He said this was further underlined by a recent decision of the EU Court of Justice affirming "State of Israel is present in the territories concerned as an occupying power and not as a sovereign entity".</p>
      <p>The judgement also outlined that the settlements constituted "a policy of population transfer conducted by that State (Israel) outside its territory, in violation of the rules of general international humanitarian law".</p>
      <p>Ambassador Abdelrazek said: "Ireland has long been a supporter of international law, recognition of the State of Palestine is part of the current programme for Government, as passed by the Dáil and the Seanad.</p>
      <blockquote>"A peaceful two-state solution is being threatened, and those United Nations member states who believe in peace and security should now lead the way in recognising the State of Palestine."</blockquote>
      <p>Amnesty International USA's advocacy director for the Middle East and North Africa, Philippe Nassif, said: "Today the United States government announced to the rest of the world that it believes the US and Israel are above the law: that Israel can continue to violate international law and Palestinians’ human rights and the US will firmly support it in doing so.</p>
      <p>"Today, the United States government announced to the rest of the world that it believes the US and Israel are above the law: that Israel can continue to violate international law and Palestinians’ human rights and the US will firmly support it in doing so.</p>
      <blockquote>"Today's announcement does not and will not change the law which is crystal clear: the construction and maintenance of settlements in the Occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, breaches international law and amounts to war crimes.</blockquote>
      <p>"It does however place the Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, at increased risk by giving Israel the green light to continue with its settlement building and expansion policy which sit at the heart of human rights crisis in the area."</p>
      <p>"The US announcement not only goes against the international consensus on the illegality of Israeli settlements but also goes against the US's legal obligation to respect and ensure respect for the Geneva Conventions."</p>
      <p>This is the latest row-back in US policy in relation to the conflict between Palestine and Israel.</p>
      <p>Back in December 2017, <b><a href="https://www.newstalk.com/news/trump-to-move-us-embassy-to-jerusalem-recognising-it-as-israels-capital-518760">Mr Trump announced</a> </b>that the US officially recognised Jerusalem as the capital city of Israel.</p>
      <p>Palestinians view the eastern part of the city as their own capital.</p>
      <p>The city is also home to sites that are holy to Muslims, Jews and Christians.</p>
      <p>While almost a year later, the US moved its embassy from Tel Aviv to the disputed city.</p>
