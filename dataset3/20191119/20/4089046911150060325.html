      <p>"I heard a noise that was very unusual," Bill Oakes, a Sharp Vista neighbor who saw the plane."In my opinion it was reckless. Anything flying below the roof line. I would say they were less than five hundred feet -- at times."</p>
      <p>An East Tennessee aviation expert watched the video and told WVLT News the pilot was acting 'totally reckless' and appeared to violate regulations.</p>
      <p>Multiple residents in East Tennessee reported seeing the plane Thursday evening.</p>
      <p>A resident of Seymour, Teresa Willard-Ammons, claimed she spotted the plane flying low in some residential areas.</p>

      <p>On November 15, FAA originally told WVLT News that the Nashville Flight Standards Office had not received any complaints or reports.</p>
      <p>Upon a recheck Tuesday, November 19, the FAA confirmed at least three complaints had been filed.</p>
      <p>An aviation expert told WVLT News the plane appeared to be an old Cessna or perhaps a home-built aircraft, both of which require licenses to fly.</p>
      <p>He said this particular aircraft was not an Ultralight and that a single-seat Ultralight does not require a license to fly.</p>
