      <h1>'I can't hear a bl**dy word': Elderly residents complain about council's new £150,000 sound system</h1>
      <h2>They took matters into their own hands</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T20:49:06+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 20:49</time> by <a rel="author">Amanda Cameron</a></address>
      <p>Three elderly <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/south-gloucestershire">South Gloucestershire</a> residents took matters into their own hands when they found they could not hear “a bl***dy word” at a recent council meeting - despite a brand new £150,000 sound system.</p>
      <p>The Severn Beach residents had made their way to the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/kingswood">Kingswood</a> Civic Centre to attend a planning meeting on November 14.</p>
      <p>But they were unable to hear what a softly spoken council officer was saying, despite a brand new audio visual system having recently been installed in the council chamber.</p>
      <p>Other members of the public - including this reporter - were also straining to hear what was said by the officer and some councillors in the cavernous room.</p>
      <p>Such was the inaudibility of the proceedings, Pilning and Severn Beach councillor Robert Griffin intervened from the public gallery. </p>
      <p>“Bearing in mind the age of these people, can you speak up,” he said.</p>
      <p>“You need to be two inches from the microphone.”</p>
      <p>The request appeared to fall on deaf ears, however, and the proceedings continued at a scarcely audible level.</p>
      <p>The mutterings from the public gallery grew louder, however, with a whispered “I can’t hear a bl***dy word” followed by a louder and more exasperated “we can’t hear at all”.</p>

      <p>Finally, when an attempt by the democratic services officer to turn up the volume failed to improve matters, the fed-up Severn Beach trio decamped from the public gallery to the council benches, taking their places beside elected members of the planning committee in the hope of hearing what was going on.</p>
      <p>They were immediately ordered to “move back one” by committee chair Keith Burchell to preserve the “separation” between members of the public and elected representatives.</p>
      <p>After the meeting, which continued peaceably after the residents moved back a row, a council spokesman said: “We are not aware of any sound issues, however a new audio visual system has been recently installed in the council chamber and we are currently monitoring its operation.</p>
      <p>“If anyone has problems hearing during a council meeting then please raise it with the democratic officer present and we will endeavour to raise the volume level.”</p>
      <p>The council paid £150,000 to buy the new audio visual system, which replaced an old sound system installed about 12 years ago, the spokesman said. The cost also covers five years of maintenance and support.</p>
      <p>But the new system appears unable to amplify gentler voices to the point where they are clearly audible from the public gallery of the council chamber.</p>
      <p>The point of holding council meetings in public is so that members of the public can witness and participate in local democracy.</p>
