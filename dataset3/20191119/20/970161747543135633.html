      <p>As <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/boris-johnson/">Boris Johnson</a> and Jeremy Corbyn went head to head in the election debate tonight, many viewers have been left wondering ‘what’s wrong with Jeremy Corbyn’s wonkly glasses?’</p>
      <p>The Labour leader appeared at the debate, wearing glasses which were bent to one side.</p>
      <p>Many took to Twitter to ask: ‘Why are Jeremy Corbyn’s glasses crooked.’</p>
      <p>One social media user added: ‘Jeremy Corbyn’s glasses are wonky and a little steamed up’.</p>
      <p>Many even complained they couldn’t focus on the substance of the debate, because they were too distracted by the Labour leader’s specs.</p>
      <p>However, Mr Corbyn has earlier said he is receiving treatment for an eye condition at Moorfields Eye Hospital.</p>

      <p>A Labour Party spokesperson had said in March: ‘Jeremy has a muscle weakness in his right eye which has become apparent in recent months.</p>
      <p>‘He is being treated at Moorfields Eye Hospital and thanks the wonderful staff for their care and expertise.’</p>
      <p>They added that he was ‘using corrective glasses as part of the treatment’.</p>
