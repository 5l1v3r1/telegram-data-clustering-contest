        <b>Emma Bunton felt inspired after learning about children’s rights at a London primary school which focused on Unicef teachings.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Spice Girl went to George Spicer Primary school to learn about how children’s rights improve educational outcomes.</p>
      <p>Baby Spice, who joined the kids in a day of fun activities, exclaimed: ‘It’s been amazing to spend time with the children and to see how engaged and passionate they are learning about their rights – from the right to play to the right to have healthy food.</p>
      <p>‘It’s something all children deserve and it’s so important that we as parents, caregivers and teachers encourage and support these fundamental rights.’</p>
      <p>Unicef’s Rights Respecting Schools Award have already raised more than £7 million which helped to provide quality education for children.</p>
      <p>The 43-year-old was shown their focus on ‘non-discrimination’ which states that Unicef’s child’s rights apply to every child, ‘whatever their ethnicity, gender, religion, language, abilities or any other status, whatever they think or say, whatever their family background’.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, one half of the late 90’s Australian pop duo Madison Avenue blasted Emma’s ‘karaoke’ cover of their hit single Don’t Call Me Baby.</p>
      <p>The song was originally released as a single in 1999, topping the UK Singles Chart and reaching number two in the group’s native Australia.</p>
      <p>And the Emma performed her own take on it for her fourth studio album My Happy Place, which was released earlier in the year.</p>
      <p>Now Andy Van Dorsselaer, who was the duo’s main producer, has claimed that Baby Spice’s version of the song ‘had no edge’.</p>
      <p>‘It felt like a karaoke version,’ he told the Herald Sun. ‘It should have had some raunch to it.</p>
      <p>‘It’s a female empowerment song about having guts and telling a guy you’ve had enough, which ironically is very now with the #MeToo movement.</p>
      <p>‘It was a #MeToo song 20 years ago. For me, that version had no edge.’</p>
