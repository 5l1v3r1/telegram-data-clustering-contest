      <p>PHOENIX â€” A 7-month-old girl was allegedly shaken by her father and sustained 15 fractures to her arms and legs.</p>
      <p>On October 24, Phoenix police reported that a 7-month-old girl was brought to Phoenix Children's hospital by her parents.</p>

      <p>Cates was arrested on November 13 and charged with two counts of child abuse.</p>
