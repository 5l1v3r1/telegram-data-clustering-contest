      <h1>ITV election debate audience bursts out laughing as Boris Johnson says truth matters</h1>
      <h2>The Tory leader who's been sacked twice for lying didn't quite get this one past the audience or ITV host Julie Etchingham</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T20:43:01+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 20:43</time> by <a rel="author">Dan Bloom, https://www.facebook.com/mirrordanbloom</a></address>
      <p>Audience members in tonight's ITV election debate burst out laughing tonight as <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> said the truth matters.</p>
      <p>The Tory leader was briefly shamed - and even hit by an inaudible heckle - as he made the bold claim in the studio in Salford.</p>
      <p>Asked by host Julie Etchingham "does truth matter", he replied: "I think it does".</p>
      <p>A ripple of laughter went through the audience - and someone shouted out at the PM, who was twice sacked from previous jobs for lying.</p>
      <p>It wasn't all plain sailing for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> either though.</p>
      <p>Labour's leader also suffered laughter as he said his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> position was "clear", despite Labour not yet knowing how it'll campaign in a second referendum six months after taking office.</p>
      <p>And others laughed when Mr Corbyn said a four-day week would be "paid for by productivity increases" across the economy.</p>

      <p>Mr Johnson made the claim despite telling at least four lies or half-truths in the debate - mostly about <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a>.</p>
      <p>The Tory leader said the only reason Britain was having an election was because "Parliament won't deliver Brexit" - even though he triggered it because MPs simply asked for more time for debate.</p>
      <p>He said Mr Corbyn would raise corporation tax to the highest level in Europe, despite there being higher rates than Labour's planned 26% in France (32%), Portugal (32%), Germany (30%), Belgium (30%), Greece (28%) and Italy (28%).</p>
      <p>And he repeated his claim that he is building 40 "new hospitals", despite the fact the pledge is over a long period and includes renovations of existing hospitals.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>It came as the pair clashed on ITV in the first live TV debate of the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">general election</a> .</p>
      <p>The leaders of the UK's two major parties went head-to-head in an hour-long debate hosted by Julie Etchingham in Salford's MediaCityUK.</p>
      <p>The Lib Dems and the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/snp">SNP</a> yesterday lost a High Court battle to have their leaders included in the debate.</p>
      <p>A snap YouGov poll found Boris Johnson won the debate - only just.</p>
      <p>Some 51% of those polled said Mr Johnson won while 49% went for Jeremy Corbyn.</p>
