      <h1>Jose Mourinho's stance on replacing Mauricio Pochettino as Tottenham Hotspur manager</h1>
      <h2>Tottenham chief Daniel Levy sacked Mauricio Pochettino on Tuesday night after a disappointing start to the season, and Mourinho is the bookmakers' favourite</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T20:38:04+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 20:38</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Richards, https://www.facebook.com/AARichards/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jose-mourinho">Jose Mourinho</a> is ‘open’ to returning to Premier League management as <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> Hotspur boss, following the exit of <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/mauricio-pochettino">Mauricio Pochettino.</a></p>
      <p>The Portuguese is the bookmakers’ favourite to replace the Argentine, after he was unceremoniously dumped by club chief Daniel Levy.</p>
      <p>Just five months after leading Spurs to the Champions League final, Pochettino held crisis talks with Levy during the international break.</p>
      <p>And Levy declared that the decision was made "in the club's best interests.”</p>

      <p>"We were extremely reluctant to make this change and it is not a decision the Board has taken lightly, nor in haste,” said Levy in a club statement.</p>
      <p>“Regrettably domestic results at the end of last season and beginning of this season have been extremely disappointing.</p>
      <p>“It falls to the Board to make the difficult decisions - this one made more so given the many memorable moments we have had with Mauricio and his coaching staff - but we do so in the Club's best interests.</p>

      <p>“Mauricio and his coaching staff will always be part of our history. I have the utmost admiration for the manner in which he dealt with the difficult times away from a home ground whilst we built the new stadium and for the warmth and positivity he brought to us.</p>
      <p>"I should like to thank him and his coaching staff for all they have contributed. They will always be welcome here.</p>
      <p>“We have a talented squad. We need to re-energise and look to deliver a positive season for our supporters.”</p>
      <p>Mourinho has been without a club since leaving <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> last December but had initially wanted to return to action in the summer.</p>
      <p>And it’s understood that Mourinho would be keen on taking charge in north London, having been snubbed by Bayern Munich recently.</p>
      <p>Bayern for their part currently have Hansi Flick in caretaker charge but are admirers of Pochettino.</p>
      <p>They could now turn to the Argentine on a permanent basis, but if Pochettino doesn’t wish to take charge in Bavaria immediately, then they will likely stick with Flick until the end of the season.</p>
      <p>Bayern had little interest in turning power at the Allianz Arena over to Mourinho.</p>
      <p>The question now is whether Daniel Levy will be willing to do so at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.</p>
