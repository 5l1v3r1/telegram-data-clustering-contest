      <p>Rising Cardiff Blues star Harri Millard has been cited following the region's win over Calvisano at the weekend.</p>
      <p>The promising 23-year-old will be hauled in front of a judicial panel for allegedly striking Calvisano's Kayle Van Zyl with his foot during the Challenge Cup clash.</p>
      <p>The hearing will take place tomorrow and determine whether or not the Welshman is guilty.</p>
      <p>The offence carries a low end entry point of two weeks, mid-range of six weeks and a top end of 10 to 52 weeks.</p>

        <b>Saracens hit with ANOTHER fine</b>
      </p>
      <p>It's been a tough few weeks for Saracens who have been slapped with another fine.</p>
      <p>Recently, the defending English and European champions accepted a 35-point deduction and a Â£5.36 million fine for breaching salary cap regulations in the Gallagher Premiership.</p>
      <p>After that furore was whipped up a few weeks back, Sarries didn't turn up to the European Champions Cup launch in Cardiff, as they are obliged to do.</p>
      <p>As such, tournament organisers have slapped them with another undisclosed fine.</p>
      <p>A statement from EPCR read: "Having previously indicated that they would be represented at the event, Saracens' failure to attend constituted a breach of the 2019-20 Heineken Champions Cup media rules, and compromised EPCR's ability to deliver the rights contracted to its broadcast, commercial and media partners."</p>
      <p>"In light of this breach of its rules, EPCR has decided to impose a fine on Saracens which has been paid by the club, and the sum of which will remain undisclosed."</p>

        <b>Ospreys sign Super Rugby talent</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Ospreys have signed former New Zealand Maori fly-half Marty McKenzie after losing star signing Gareth Anscombe for much of the season.</p>
      <p>Anscombe is battling back from a serious knee injury that he suffered against England this summer, dashing his World Cup dreams, but is expected to miss most, if not all, of the season.</p>
      <p>The Wales pivot was due to show up at the Liberty Stadium after this year's global gathering, but Ospreys fans will have to wait to see their star signing.</p>
      <p>As such, the region have called in reinforcements and McKenzie, brother of All Blacks star Damian, will link up with the region immediately.</p>
      <p>McKenzie joins the Ospreys until the end of the season.</p>
