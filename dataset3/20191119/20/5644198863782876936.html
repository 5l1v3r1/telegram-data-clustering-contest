      <p>SEPANG: The transition of power will be decided "when the time comes," Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Tuesday (Nov 19).</p>
      <p>"We do not know yet whether the situation in the country now is ready for a transition in administration or not. When the time comes we will decide,” he told reporters.</p>

      <p>Dr Mahathir was asked to comment on remarks made by former deputy president of PKR Syed Husin Ali.</p>
      <p>The latter had said that the ruling Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition's <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/barisan-nasional-wee-jeck-seng-wins-tanjung-piai-byelection-12100108">failure to win in the Tanjung Piai by-election</a> at the weekend was a referendum on Dr Mahathir's leadership, news portal <a href="https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/500098">Malaysiakini</a> reported.</p>
      <p>In September, Syed Husin had also criticised Dr Mahathir for not laying out a clear plan on the power transition.</p>
      <p>When asked on reports that several PH members of parliament have blamed him for the defeat in Tanjung Piai, Dr Mahathir said: "Maybe I was wrong; how would I know?”</p>
