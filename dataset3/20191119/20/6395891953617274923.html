      <p>According to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/19/mazda-recalling-nearly-117000-vehicles-over-faulty-takata-air-bags.html">CNBC</a>, the action covers nearly 117,000 vehicles recalled from 2013 to 2017 that received Takata replacement inflators because parts from other manufacturers were not available.</p>
      <p>Vehicles included are 2007 to 2012 CX-7 and CX-9 SUVs, and 2003 through 2012 Mazda6 sedan, according to <a href="https://apnews.com/6c8ec12031f04a7d96e6a2c9be97551d">The Associated Press</a>. Other models covered are 2004 and 2005 MPV minivans, 2004 RX-8 sports cars, and 2006 and 2007 Mazdaspeed6 sedans, the AP said.</p>
      <p>"In certain vehicles, the driver and/or front passenger airbag inflator supplied by Takata could deploy abnormally in the event of a crash," Mazda said on its <a href="https://www.mazdausa.com/owners/recalls">website</a>.</p>
      <p>The Takata airbags utilized ammonium nitrate to create an explosion that led to inflation. When it is exposed to high heat and humidity, the chemical can burn too fast and blow apart a metal canister.</p>
      <p>In 2018, Mazda recalled 270,000 vehicles over possible exploding Takata airbags. </p>
      <p>The recall is expected to begin Dec. 18, 2019, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's <a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/recalls?nhtsaId=19V781">website</a>. Owners may contact Mazda customer service at 1-800-222-5500, the NHTSA said. Owners may also call the NHTSA vehicle safety hotline at 1-888-327-4236 or go to www.safercar.gov.</p>
      <p>Notification letters will be mailed by Dec. 12, company officials said. </p>
