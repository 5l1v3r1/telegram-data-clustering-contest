      <h1>JNU moves HC, seeks contempt action against students, police</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T20:01:16+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 20:01</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/PRESS-TRUST-OF-INDIA-6101/" target="_blank">PRESS TRUST OF INDIA</a></address>
      <p>The JNU on Tuesday approached the Delhi High Court seeking contempt action against its students and the Delhi police for allegedly violating a court order against holding a protest within 100 metres of the university’s administrative block.</p>
      <p>The JNU claimed that the students had grossly violated the August 9, 2017, order of the High Court by holding a protest within 100 metres of the administrative block and affecting its day-to-day working, which has been disrupted since October 28.</p>
      <p>It said the police also violated the court order by refusing and failing to take action to maintain law and order in the university and removing the blockade around the administrative block.</p>
      <p>The petition, filed through the Central government’s standing counsel Monika Arora, sought direction to issue contempt notice against the alleged contemnors (students and police) and punish them in accordance with the Contempt of Courts Act for alleged willful disobedience of the court order.</p>
