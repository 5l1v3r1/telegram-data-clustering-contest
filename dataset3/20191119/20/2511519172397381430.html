      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a>’s personal physician, Navy commander Sean Conley, has written a letter insisting the president’s unannounced Saturday visit to the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, was “a routine, planned interim checkup”.</p>
      <p>“Despite some of the speculation, the president has not had any chest pain, nor was he evaluated or treated for any urgent or acute issues,” Commander Conley wrote in his statement, issued by the White House in a bid to dispel rumours that a more serious health complaint was being covered up.</p>
      <p>Four key witnesses are due to appear before the House <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/impeachment-inquiry">impeachment inquiry</a> on Tuesday to testify on the Ukraine scandal – <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/alexander-vindman">Alexander Vindman</a>, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/jennifer-williams">Jennifer Williams</a>, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/kurt-volker">Kurt Volker</a> and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/tim-morrison">Tim Morrison</a> – after the US Supreme Court blocked the release of Mr Trump’s tax returns to Congress.</p>

I talked with Lawrence Tribe (constitutional law professor at Harvard) yesterday, he said this about the “policy dispute” defense: “I don’t know what defence they will eventually settle on, but that one, I think, goes nowhere.”<br/></i> <br/><i>“There are federal laws limiting the circumstances in which a president ... can ... refuse to spend money. He hasn’t invoked any of those authorities, and so the power of the president to represent the nation in foreign policy is neither here nor there.” </i></p>

However, buried among the witnesses’ personal opinions and conjecture about a call the White House long ago released to the public, both witnesses testified the July 25 transcript was ‘accurate’ and nothing President Trump has done or said amounts to ‘bribery’ or any other crime. Today’s hearing only further exposes that Chairman Schiff and the Democrats are simply blinded by their hatred for Donald Trump and rabid desire to overturn the outcome of a free and fair election."</p>

        <p>The president, speaking to the media ahead of a cabinet meeting, was asked about Lt Col <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/alexander-vindman">Alexander Vindman</a>, a National Security Council expert who was testifying to the House impeachment hearings on the 25 July phone call between Mr Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart which sparked the probe.</p>
        <p>Lt Col Vindman was listening to the call, in which Mr Trump appeared to pressure Volodymyr Zelenksy into starting investigations into his political opponents in return for releasing US military aid.</p>
        <p>The Iraq War veteran was wearing his military uniform at the hearing and at one point insisted on being addressed as Lt Col Vindman after Republican congressman <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/devin-nunes">Devin Nunes</a> called him Mr Vindman.</p>

        <p>ICYMI: Before she was fired, the former US ambassador to Ukraine, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/marie-yovanovitch">Marie Yovanovitch</a>, was advised by the US State Department to issue a public statement of loyalty to President <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/DonaldTrump">Donald Trump</a>, possibly on camera, the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/impeachment">impeachment</a> inquiry has heard.</p>
        <p>Giving evidence to the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/intelligence-committee">Intelligence Committee</a> in Washington DC on Monday, the under secretary of state for political affairs, David Hale, described how in March 2019, Ms Yovanovitch came under fire during a “smear campaign” allegedly led by Mr Trump’s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani – who apparently wanted her removed from office.</p>
        <p>The so-called smear campaign, four months before the 25 July phone call between Mr Trump and Ukrainian president <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/volodymyr-zelensky">Volodymyr Zelensky</a> at the centre of the impeachment scandal, focused on an allegation the Ukrainian prosecutor general Yuriy Lutsenko said Ms Yovanovitch had given him a “do not prosecute list,” though Mr Lutsenko later retracted that claim. </p>
        <p>According to Mr Hale, during the smear campaign, Ms Yovanovitch felt “the tempo of the social media and other criticisms of her were such that she felt she could no longer function” in her role.</p>
