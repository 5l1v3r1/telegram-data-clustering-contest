      <p>SEATTLE -- A new effort has been launched to save one of Seattle's remaining iconic performance spaces -- The Showbox.</p>
      <p>Historic Seattle and Seattle Theatre Group have joined forces to buy the building. They submitted an offer to purchase the property in October.</p>
      <p>"Historic preservation is not solely about protecting a physical building, it's about preserving the nature of what happens within it," said Ricardo Frazer, board chair of Seattle Theatre Group. "That is why we are compelled to stand beside Historic Seattle in this effort. In an era when the redevelopment of cultural space is far too common, we fear what the loss of this iconic venue would mean to our region."</p>
      <p>Eugenia Woo is director of preservation services at Historic Seattle. She says that "Landmarks deserve protection."</p>
      <p>"As we continue our due diligence and look forward to the opportunity to negotiate with the property's owner, Historic Seattle will not back down in our fight to protect The Showbox," Woo said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Under the purchase plan, the two parties agree to keep AEG contracted to manage The Showbox until at least 2024.</p>
      <p>An effort to save The Showbox was spurred when the property's owner was <a href="https://komonews.com/news/local/seattles-iconic-showbox-could-be-demolished">nearing a deal to sell </a>it in 2018. A Vancouver BC-based developer was reportedly angling to buy the building. The developer's plan was to tear down the structure and build a 44-story tower in its place; 442 residential units along with parking would have come with the tower.</p>
      <p>While the purchase offer is considered by the building's owner, another effort is underway at Seattle City Hall. The city already designated The Showbox<a href="https://komonews.com/news/local/showbox-theater-voted-in-as-historical-landmark"> as a landmark in July</a>. Now the city's Landmarks Preservation Board is attempting to implement control and incentive regulations to preserve important features of the building. Under the process, the property owner would get access to grants or tax breaks for preserving the building's characteristics.</p>
      <p>"Securing controls will protect the space, while our purchase and partnership will ensure it continues to be used for live performances, not only honoring its history but guaranteeing its role in our community for future generations," Frazer said.</p>
      <p>The issue is slated for a Dec. 18 meeting of the Landmarks Preservation Board.</p>
      <p>Seattle Theatre Group operates various venues around Seattle, including The Paramount, Moore, and Neptune.</p>
