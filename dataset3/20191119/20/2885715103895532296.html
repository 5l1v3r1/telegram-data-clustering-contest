      <h1>Mumbai: No bids for auction of flats linked to Iqbal Mirchi</h1>

      <p>No bids were received Tuesday during the auction of two flats belonging to gangster Iqbal Mirchi. The 1,200-sq ft flats in Juhu were being auctioned at a base price of Rs 3.45 crore.</p>
      <p>According to sources, as the rate was higher than the market price, it did not generate much interest. The base price, an official said, will now be revised and the flats would be put up on auction again. The auction is being carried out by the Ministry of Finance under the Smugglers and Foreign Exchange Manipulators (Forfeiture of Property) Act (SAFEMA). The auctioning process is carried out online.</p>
      <p>Mirchi, who died in London in 2013, allegedly managed gangster Dawood Ibrahimâ€™s drug, betting and real estate business in London and Dubai. SAFEMA authorities are likely to auction 13 other properties linked to underworld gangster Dawood soon after its valuation is complete.</p>
