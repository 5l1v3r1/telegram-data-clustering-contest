      <h1>Disney+ Hacked? Or Do You Just Have a Bad Password?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T20:20:40+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 20:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.geek.com/author/genevieve_scarano/" target="_blank">Genevieve Scarano</a></address>
      <p>When <a href="https://www.geek.com/tech/geek-pick-disneys-streaming-content-is-king-1810353/">Disney+</a> first launched, many experienced issues while trying to log into the <a href="https://www.geek.com/geek-pick/cut-the-cord-and-subscribe-to-these-streaming-tv-services-1704574/">streaming TV service</a>. But as far as problems go, waiting a few extra minutes to watch <a href="https://www.geek.com/culture/the-mandalorians-baby-yoda-is-twitters-new-son-1811122/"><i>The Mandalorian</i></a> is nothing compared to having your identity stolen. As the week-long free trial comes to an end, many users are finding their accounts hacked and in some cases sold online for a couple of bucks. At least, that’s according to a <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/thousands-of-hacked-disney-accounts-are-already-for-sale-on-hacking-forums/">ZDNet</a> report.</p>
      <p>However, further reporting from outlets like <a href="https://gizmodo.com/disney-has-a-hacking-problem-1839928191">Gizmodo</a> suggest the problem isn’t Disney+ itself being hacked, although the lack of two-factor authentication doesn’t help, but rather users have had their passwords stolen from other locations. And then if they happened to use that same password on Disney+, then the account is compromised, even if Disney itself wasn’t breached. <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/roundup/300318/the-best-password-managers">So get better passwords!</a></p>

      <p>Disney+ has finally launched and the <a href="https://www.geek.com/movies/disney-updates-marvel-movies-available-to-stream-at-launch-1810098/">mega kickoff</a> is reportedly causing some connection issues across the U.S.</p>
      <p>The streaming service, which features many <a href="https://www.geek.com/movies/11-obscure-movies-you-should-watch-on-disney-1809503/">movies and TV shows</a>, officially went live this morning. However, over the past couple of hours, Disney+ has been showing <a href="https://www.geek.com/television/disney-experiences-connection-issues-on-launch-day-1810197/">“unable to connect” errors</a> for many East Coast customers, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/12/20960956/disney-plus-unable-to-connect-error-streaming">The Verge reported</a>.</p>
      <p>Subscribers shared their error notifications on Twitter, which showed Mickey Mouse and Pluto in space or characters from <i>Wreck-It Ralph </i>playing with WiFi symbols and an “unable to connect to Disney+” message.</p>
