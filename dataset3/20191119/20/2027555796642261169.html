      <h1>Germany detains Syrian over suspected bomb plot</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T20:15:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 20:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/afp" target="_blank">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Police in Berlin on Tuesday arrested a 26-year-old Syrian man accused of planning an Islamist attack, with prosecutors saying he had begun to acquire chemicals for a bomb.</p>
      <p>The unnamed suspect also exchanged instructions on ways to manufacture weapons and explosives with other suspected Islamists in a chat group on the Telegram messaging app, Berlin prosecutors said.</p>
      <p>The Syrian stands accused of preparing "a serious act of violence against the state" and was arrested at his Berlin home, they added.</p>
      <p>In a separate statement, federal prosecutors specializing in terrorist cases said special police officers searched the man's flat on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The accused had in recent months purchased acetone and hydrogen peroxide, they added. Both are key components in the highly explosive TATP.</p>
      <p>"This was to be detonated at an unknown time in an unknown place in Germany in order to kill and injure as many people as possible", the federal prosecutors said.</p>
      <p>The Syrian was working as a cleaner in a Berlin elementary school, a spokesman for the Berlin interior ministry told AFP. Before that, he was employed at the capital's Bode-Museum.</p>
      <p>German security forces had been watching the suspect for the past three months following a tip-off from a foreign intelligence service, he added.</p>
      <p>Germany remains on alert following a series of Islamist attacks, the deadliest of which was a truck rampage at a Berlin Christmas market in 2016 that killed 12 people.</p>
      <p>Dozens of suspects have been arrested or charged over alleged terror plots in recent years.</p>
