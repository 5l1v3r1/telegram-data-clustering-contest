      <p>Downtown Wichita Falls has added a lot of fun businesses over the last few years, but there's one thing we don't have, and that's a rooftop restaurant or bar. But that may soon be changing!</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.texomashomepage.com/news/local-news/wf-city-council-new-rooftop-bar-eatery-could-soon-be-coming-to-wichita-falls/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=facebook_Texomashomepage.com_-_KFDX,_KJTL&amp;fbclid=IwAR2cFdbqxY4_xXckKqnEUzUg1cywbqc3U5Pj5M9Lwl2AEsbWuPzkQ6X6Kcg">Texoma's Homepage</a>, the Wichita Falls city council just signed off on funding up to $133,000 from the 4B Sales Tax Corporation funds for renovations to the Filgo building at 10th and Indiana. The building currently houses <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PickersUniverse/">Picker's Universe</a> on the ground floor and the planned 2.5 million dollars in renovations would be for a restaurant and bar on the second floor with some rooftop seating.</p>
      <p>The 24,000 square foot building was built by G.W. Filgo in 1929 and originally housed a hardware store. Developers hope to have the restaurant and bar open sometime in the spring of 2020.</p>
