      </p>
      <p>A very small species of insect which protects against invasive pests that threaten crops has been named after popular actor Idris Elba.</p>
      <p>The Idris Elba wasp was first discovered in Guanajuato, Mexico, where it was seen attacking the eggs of bagrada stink bug, a major pest that feeds on cabbage and broccoli, Evening Standard reports.</p>
      <p>According to the newspaper, scientists said that the latest discovery will go a long way in the effective control of pest, especially the ones that attack farm produce.</p>

      <p>There has, however, not been a formally released reason as to why the species was named after the popular actor.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, speculations have it that the insect may have been named after Elba because it is protective just as the actor’s character, Heimdall in Marvel films, a role he has played in Thor: Ragnarok and Avengers: Infinity War.</p>

      <p>It should be noted that before now Idris Elba has been known to only parasite on spider eggs, where latest discovery pointed out that it also fights other crop-destroying pests.</p>
      <p>The bagrada bug that the wasp recently attacked is native to Africa and could be found in other areas of the world.</p>
