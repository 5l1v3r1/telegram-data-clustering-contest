      <p>When most people think of eating in Greece, they instantly conjure up images of juicy Souvlaki, charming fish tavernas and syrup-soaked traditional sweets. While these food stalwarts will never die, the Athens food scene is shaping itself into a food-force to be reckoned with. Here are the Athens food-finds we’re loving right now.</p>

        <b>Alex the fresh pasta bar</b>
      </p>
      <p>Pasta lovers rejoice! This casual little kitchen in the heart of Kolonaki is run by young and talented chef Alex Vassilatos, whose passion for pasta comes to life in the beautifully made dishes on offer. Heroing Greek products like flour of Lemnos and <i>Xinomizithra</i> from Chania, the menu changes frequently to feature the best seasonal produce available from all over Greece. Warning: you’re guaranteed to want to try everything on the menu, so don’t go alone!</p>

        <b>Hams &amp; Clams</b>
      </p>
      <p>This stylish Oyster bar is ideally situated, overlooking the yachts of Marina Zeas in Piraeus. While Oysters aren’t something you often see on Greek menus, at Hams and Clams, you can enjoy freshly caught oysters, served both fresh and cooked (try the Bloody Mary oyster <i>sfinaki</i>). Also on offer are some fantastic fresh seafood dishes, like the <i>tsipoura</i> ceviche and the <i>kritharato</i> with crab meat. With an impressive wine list to match the food on offer, Hams &amp; Clams offers the perfect Athenian afternoon by the water.</p>

        <b>Maraboo Ice Cream</b>
      </p>
      <p>A welcome addition to the hip neighbourhood of Pagkrati, at Maraboo, the ice cream is made fresh each day and there is usually a line outside this cute little shop front (don’t worry, it moves fast!). With a rotation of interesting combinations (lavender and honey, Greek rice pudding) and more traditional flavours (milk chocolate, salted caramel) on offer, it’s time to check out this tiny spot with big flavours. </p>
      <p>
        <i>Maraboo Ice Cream – Archelaou 17, Pagkrati (Open 14.00-21.30 Mon – Fri, 12.00-21.30 Sat – Sun)</i>

        <b>To Lokali</b>
      </p>
      <p>As the name suggests, this all-day hangout spot aims to create an atmosphere of the “local” (no matter where you’re from). Not quite a cafe, not quite a restaurant, not quite a bar, To Lokali has a varied offering, all of which focuses on big flavours served up in a cool, unpretentious environment. The day starts with brunch, rolls on with coffee and beers, continues with high-quality taverna-style food with a twist, and ends late with an intriguing cocktail list. Take your pick of the lush outdoor courtyard or the quirky interior featuring murals by local artist The Rabbit Knows. Simply put, however, you choose to spend your time here, you’ll feel like a local (and a pretty hip one at that).  </p>
