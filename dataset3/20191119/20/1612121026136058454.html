      <p>Samsung has <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/333632-samsung-updates-the-galaxy-s9-with-a-camera-improvement-and-october-security-patch/">gotten much better</a> about <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/340262-samsungs-older-watches-get-one-ui-update-including-galaxy-watch-gear-s3-and-gear-sport/">updating older devices</a> with newer software and features lately, which helps keep their current lineup of phones and wearables in sync. Many devices were <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/334530-samsung-one-ui-may-have-leaked-galaxy-s10-colors/">updated to One UI</a> with Android 9.0 Pie, and several of them will be getting <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/344950-galaxy-one-ui-2-beta-south-korea/">One UI 2.0 with their Android 10 update</a>. The Galaxy Watch family also sees some feature updates from time to time.</p>
      <h3>Galaxy Watch Active2 Features</h3>
      <p>The latest update takes some of the new UX stuff from the <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-watch-active-2-review-androids-best-apple-watch-contender/">Galaxy Watch Active2</a> and brings it back to the original <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/337247-samsungs-galaxy-watch-active-set-to-drop-the-rotating-bezel-with-a-smaller-screen/">Galaxy Watch Active</a> as well as the standard Galaxy Watch.</p>
      <p>Bixby spearheads the list, as Samsung has added some new tricks to its digital assistant. You’ll be able to <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/341528-samsung-opens-up-their-ecosystem-announces-the-bixby-marketplace-for-users-to-download-capsules/">ask Bixby</a> to start exercise routines or check the time difference between two places, and it’s expanded to support many more languages as well.</p>
      <p>The watches will also be getting much more customizable with 24 new sub-dials and complications on top of the 17 already-existing complications available. Additionally, <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/342740-samsung-galaxy-watch-active2/">the My Style feature</a> is getting back ported to both watches so you can take a photo of your outfit and have a custom watch face generated to match.</p>
      <p>The interface itself is changing up a bit to match some of the small improvements that were made to the Galaxy Watch Active2 that should make your watch a little easier to navigate and manage. <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/332575-samsung-health-gets-updated-to-6-0-bringing-a-ui-overhaul-and-more-personalization/">Samsung Health</a> also learns a few new tricks and can alert you to a low heart rate, track lap times while running or cycling, and manage fitness goals a little better.</p>
      <p>Expect to see this update rollout gradually over the next few weeks.</p>
