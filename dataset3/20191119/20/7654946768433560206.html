      <h1>J.A. Happ trade rumblings part of Yankees’ Gerrit Cole puzzle</h1>

      <p>The Yankees are in an enviable position as this offseason begins. They could line up the current roster and be projected for 90-plus wins.</p>
      <p>Of course, they are looking to improve, whether it is simply retaining Brett Gardner or going to the top of the market for Gerrit Cole. The desperation comes from being championship-free since 2009 rather than from having huge holes to fill.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, even without overt shortcomings, part of the Yankees’ offseason is based on how they are internally answering:</p>
      <p><b>1.</b> Did James Paxton find comfort and excellence in New York? Because the guy who made those final 11 starts was an ace: 2.51 ERA/.177 batting average against. That .177 average from Aug. 1 on was fifth in the majors, between NL Cy Young winner Jacob deGrom (.172) and AL Cy winner Justin Verlander (.179).</p>
      <p>Yeah, the more the merrier, and if money is no object, then add Cole to Paxton. But my guess is money does matter to Hal Steinbrenner, and, if so, the Yankees need Paxton to be a No. 1 and have a healthy Luis Severino as his co-pilot. In fact, if the Yankees believe that the real Paxton showed up Aug. 1 — when he got control of fastballs up, breaking balls down and steelier nerves — then now might be the time to try to extend him before his walk year. Alas, his agent is Scott Boras, so discounts for going early are unlikely.</p>

      <p><b>2.</b> Did J.A. Happ find himself late? In that same period after Aug. 1, Happ held opponents to a .215 average, 19th-best in the majors. Few pitchers were hurt more by the juiced ball than Happ — nearly one out of every five fly balls the lefty permitted cleared a fence in 2019. If the ball is, um, de-juiced for 2020, Happ’s chances to return to what the Yankees thought they were purchasing — a durable No. 3-ish starter — returns. And you could see how Paxton, Severino, Happ and Masahiro Tanaka form the nucleus of a strong rotation with or without additions.</p>
      <p>Keep this in mind, though, about that contract Happ signed — it has a $17 million vesting option for 2021 if he reaches 27 starts or 165 innings in 2020; as bad as things were in 2019, Happ still made 30 starts and reached 161 1/3 innings. And the Yankees probably do not want that contract to vest. One outside executive who believed the Yankees would go for Cole if they could clear salary suggested that the Yankees would try to attach a desirable second piece to Happ and trade him to a starter-hungry team such as the Angels or White Sox, who would not mind the risk of the 2021 option vesting. For example, tie Luis Cessa or a pitching prospect to Happ.</p>
      <p>The Yanks did this after the 2017 season when they attached Bryan Mitchell to Chase Headley to get rid of the third baseman’s $13 million salary in a trade with the Padres. If successful, the Yanks would save $17 million toward the 2020 luxury-tax payroll to chase someone such as Cole.</p>
      <p><b>3.</b> <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/08/mlb-narrows-down-length-of-domingo-german-suspension-with-decision-close/">How long will Domingo German be suspended</a>? MLB has indicated it was close a few times to rendering a verdict, but the Yankees await what is expected to be a suspension of at least a month of the 2020 season, very possibly more, for German violating the terms of MLB’s domestic abuse policy. German emerged as a legit mid-rotation piece (or better) last year. Could Jordan Montgomery, fully recovered from Tommy John surgery, be the guy he was before the procedure (3.84 ERA in 35 career starts) to provide a solution or even just a placeholder until German returns?</p>
      <p><b>4.</b> Can Gleyber Torres play shortstop full-time? It sure seems like <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/18/the-didi-gregorius-free-agency-scenario-that-cant-be-ruled-out/">the Yankees are letting Didi Gregorius walk.</a> So can Torres handle a 120-130-game load at short, which would make DJ LeMahieu more a full-time second baseman and allow the Yankees to go cheap at backup short with, say, Tyler Wade? Or do they need to find a share partner for Torres or more of a full-timer at short? Because that person is not on the roster and will force the Yanks to allocate dollars and/or prospects elsewhere.</p>
      <p><b>5.</b> Do the Yankees have two third basemen, one third baseman or none? Miguel Andujar, second in the AL Rookie of the Year voting in 2018, is fully recovered from shoulder surgery that cost him last season. Can his defense improve to the point where the Yankees trust him with third? Gio Urshela was a revelation last season, but was that an aberration or who Urshela now is? In the most positive scenario, the Yankees have depth to either continue to have an infield rotation (perhaps Andujar picks up first base, too) or have an enticing trade piece in Andujar particularly. If the Yankees don’t get 2018 Andujar or 2019 Urshela, then LeMahieu has to be pulled to third, which would necessitate Torres either being the full-time second baseman or the Yankees having to fill that position so Torres can stay at short.</p>
