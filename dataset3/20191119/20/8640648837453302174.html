      <p>A 35-year-old Henderson man pleaded not guilty Tuesday to murder and other charges in the death of a 65-year-old man in a suspected DUI crash last month.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/crime/courts/las-vegas-judge-orders-100k-bail-in-fatal-dui-crash-1880417/">Kevin Raspperry</a> is accused of causing a <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/local-las-vegas/1-dead-after-crash-involving-bus-in-central-las-vegas-1879868/">seven-vehicle crash on Oct. 27</a> that killed Marcial Escobia and seriously injured his wife, Nimfa Escobia. He pleaded not guilty in District Court to charges of second-degree murder with a deadly weapon, DUI, four counts of DUI resulting in substantial bodily harm or death, four counts of reckless driving, and two counts of possession of a controlled substance.</p>
      <p>Craig Mueller, Raspperry’s attorney, argued in court that the murder charge is an “improper allegation” for a DUI case.</p>
      <p>“I don’t object to my colleagues occasionally trying to expand and change the direction of law,” Mueller said. “This magnitude of change, however, is utterly unsupported.”</p>
      <p>Charging defendants with murder in DUI cases is not without precedent in Southern Nevada, but defense attorney John Watkins recently described it as a <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/crime/homicides/2-dui-suspects-charged-with-murder-a-new-trend-in-clark-county-1892158/">“new trend.”</a></p>
      <p>“What the DA is doing is creating their own law,” said Watkins, who regularly defends DUI suspects, during an interview with the Review-Journal last week.</p>
      <p>While standing outside the courtroom clutching a picture of his father, 35-year-old Nimar Escobia said his family members are leaning on their faith in the aftermath of the crash.</p>
      <p>“We definitely have faith, trusting that justice will be served,” he said.</p>
      <p>After seeing Raspperry in court sitting in a wheelchair, Nimar Escobia said that while Raspperry’s pain may be temporary, he has permanently affected their entire family. His mother is still recovering from the crash, he said.</p>
      <p>“It’s not just the physical pain that she is going through, mentally and spiritually she is recovering day by day.”</p>
      <p>Raspperry remained in the Clark County Detention Center on Tuesday with $100,000 bail, jail records show. A status check in the case is scheduled for Thursday.</p>
