      <h1>Amazon Orders The Lord of the Rings Season 2</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T20:15:05+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 20:15</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Workman</a></address>
      <p>Although <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/the-lord-of-the-rings"><b>The Lord of the Rings</b></a> TV series hasn’t even started filming yet, Amazon already wants it to continue. <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/the-lord-of-the-rings-series-renewed-season-2-amazon-early-renewal-season-1-hiatus-writers-room-reassembled-1202788730/">Deadline</a> confirms that Amazon has ordered a second season for the show. This news comes from Amazon Studios head Jennifer Salke, who confirmed that the writers’ room already has preparations in place for it.</p>
      <p>Salke noted that there will be a filming hiatus following the filming of the first two episodes. It will be about four to five months, which should give the showrunners time to plot out the second season. This could mean a shorter wait between seasons on the Prime service, per the report.</p>
