      <h1>Sweden Drops Investigation Into Rape Allegation Against Julian Assange</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T20:00:52+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 20:00</time> by <a rel="author">Whitney Kimball</a></address>
      <p>Julian Assange has evaded more charges by running out the clock. Sweden has announced it has dropped an investigation into a rape allegation made against the Wikileaks founder, arguing that too much time has elapsed since the accusation was made in 2010. In a news conference, NPR reports, Swedish Deputy Director of Public Prosecution Eva-Marie Persson <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/19/780743412/swedish-prosecutor-ends-investigation-into-julian-assange-over-rape-claims">stated that</a> the allegation was “credible and reliable,” but that “the evidential situation has been weakened to such an extent that there is no longer any reason to continue the investigation.”</p>
      <p>Investigations into this and three other allegations of sexual assault have played a leading role in Julian Assange’s trajectory. In 2012, he fled to the Ecuadorian embassy in London, for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/17/world/americas/ecuador-to-let-assange-stay-in-its-embassy.html">the explicit reason</a> of avoiding extradition to Sweden for questioning, which he feared would lead to extradition to the US.</p>
      <p>Three allegations of sexual assault <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/aug/13/julian-assange-cases-dropped-but-rape-claim-investigation-continues">were also dropped</a> in 2015 when the statute of limitations ran out. The Guardian reported that prosecutors were unable to bring charges as they were unable to question him during his nearly seven-year stay at the embassy.</p>
      <p>Assange contended that a Swedish authority declined to take his statement at the embassy or else to “promise not to send me to the United States.”</p>
      <p>Instead, he put out <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/05/the-buried-truth-of-a-key-detail-used-to-defend-julian-assange/">his affidavit</a> published on WikiLeaks, containing specious quotes from alleged victims, with claims that the police made up the charges. The “quotes” were actually sourced from an email from his lawyers.</p>
      <p>Assange is currently serving a 50-week prison sentence in London for skipping bail in 2012 to avoid the investigations. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/dec/17/julian-assange-sweden">The Guardian</a> detailed two women’s accounts of sexual assault in 2010. Assange initially dismissed the allegations as “dirty tricks” by the Pentagon.</p>
      <p>The latest investigation resumed in May, a month after Assange was <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/04/julian-assange-dragged-out-of-ecuadorian-embassy-and-arrested-by-british-police/">forcibly dragged</a> from the Ecuadorian embassy – where he’d <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/why-ecuador-ended-asylum-spoiled-brat-julian-assange-n993711">reportedly</a> skateboarded at night, walked around in his underwear, acquired a social media cat <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/04/12/712719377/the-mystery-of-julian-assanges-cat">for good PR</a> and didn’t clean up after it, meanwhile costing the Ecuadorian government nearly $1 million (£774,000) a year – by British authorities <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/04/julian-assange-dragged-out-of-ecuadorian-embassy-and-arrested-by-british-police/">in order</a> to honour the US’s extradition request. In May, a UK judge <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/05/wikileaks-julian-assange-sentenced-skipping-uk-bail-190501084959520.html">called</a> the stay a “deliberate attempt to delay justice.”</p>
      <p>In May, the US Department of Justice <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/wikileaks-founder-julian-assange-charged-18-count-superseding-indictment">announced</a> that he’d been charged with 18 counts connected to compromising national security by allegedly helping Chelsea Manning to crack the password to a government computer and publishing hundreds of thousands of documents, as well as a video of American airstrikes murdering over a dozen people, including Reuters journalists, to the sound of laughter. Manning, who’s spent this time advocating for transgender rights and calling for government transparency, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/16/us/chelsea-manning-jail.html">survived</a> a torturous seven years in prison before President Obama commuted her sentence in 2017. She was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/16/us/chelsea-manning-jail.html">sent back</a> to jail in May for refusing to testify before a grand jury.</p>
      <p>The Obama administration <a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/11/16/as-the-obama-doj-concluded-prosecution-of-julian-assange-for-publishing-documents-poses-grave-threats-to-press-freedom/">decided against</a> charging Assange for publishing classified documents on the basis of First Amendment rights, rightfully; doing so would imperil journalism. The Trump DOJ <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2019/05/julian-assange-declines-voluntary-extradition-to-the-u-s-in-latest-court-appearance/">has no problem</a> with that, despite the fact that WikiLeaks had been so <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/11/the-secret-correspondence-between-donald-trump-jr-and-wikileaks/545738/">very helpful</a> for this administration.</p>
      <p>If convicted, Assange could face a maximum prison sentence of 175 years. He <a href="https://gizmodo.com/julian-assange-declines-voluntary-extradition-to-the-u-1834468186">has declined</a> to extradite himself voluntarily.</p>
