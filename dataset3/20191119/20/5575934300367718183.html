      <p>President Donald Trump on Tuesday doubled down on threats to increase tariffs against China, casting further uncertainty on the fate of an interim trade agreement announced in October.</p>
      <p>“If we don’t make a deal with China, I’ll just raise the tariffs even higher,” Trump said during a Cabinet meeting.</p>
      <p>The two sides have continued to hammer out the details of the first part of a deal intended to defuse a dispute that has led to punitive tariffs on thousands of products over the past year. The White House <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/us-china-trade-war-nations-reach-partial-deal-before-tariffs-2019-10-1028594254">said last month</a> that included unspecified concessions from China on technology rules, farm purchases and financial sector access.</p>
      <p>“There are talks on a daily basis between both sides,” said a spokesperson at the Office of the US Trade Representative.</p>
      <p>But the state of negotiations has become increasingly uncertain in recent weeks. Early this month, Trump denied a claim from China that the US had agreed to lift some tariffs on Chinese products as part of a broader detente.</p>
      <p>“They’d like to have a rollback,” he said, even after administration officials appeared to indicate that move was under consideration. “I haven’t agreed to anything.”White House officials have <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/trump-isnt-ready-to-sign-china-deal-white-house-advisers-2019-11-1028693854">since said</a> the president was not ready to sign any deal with China, which had initially been expected to happen at a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/chile-cancels-international-conference-where-trump-hoped-to-sign-trade-deal-with-china/2019/10/30/ab65effc-fb20-11e9-8190-6be4deb56e01_story.html">now-cancelled international conference</a> in Chile this month.</p>
      <p>In addition to tariffs, which the US has sought to keep in place as a way to enforce trade commitments, negotiators have also clashed over import quotas. Trump has said China agreed to purchase up to $US50 billion worth of agricultural products, more than twice what that country consumed from the US in 2017.</p>
      <p>The Trump administration is still scheduled to increase tariffs on December 15, a move that would hit virtually all imports from China and have more pronounced effects on households than in previous rounds.</p>
