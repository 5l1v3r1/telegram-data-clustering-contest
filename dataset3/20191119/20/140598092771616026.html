      <h1>Prince Andrew accused of making racist remarks against Arabs as politicians call for him to be stripped of taxpayer funding</h1>

      <p>A former Home Secretary has accused the Duke of York of making racist remarks about Arabs following a state dinner for the Saudi royal family.</p>
      <p>Jacqui Smith, the former Labour minister, was among several politicians who <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/royal-family/2019/11/18/businesses-charities-abandon-prince-andrew-fallout-car-crash/">waded into the drama </a>on Tuesday, heaping pressure on the beleaguered Duke and calling on him to step down from public life.</p>
      <p>She said witnesses were left “slack jawed” by the comments, which were as bad “as you could imagine.”</p>
      <p>Speaking on the LBC election podcast that she co-hosts, Ms Smith revealed that the Duke’s remarks "involved a comment about camels" which she could not bring herself to repeat.</p>
      <p>"I met him several times, including once at a state banquet where, after dinner, I and my husband and another Labour cabinet minister had a drink with him,” she said.</p>
      <p>"I have to say the conversation left us slack-jawed with the things that he felt it was appropriate to say."</p>

      <p>She added: "It was a state dinner for the Saudi royal family and he made racist comments about Arabs that were unbelievable."</p>
      <p>Describing the Duke as "the worst end of the royal family,” she went on: "The fact he thought we might find this amusing was a terrible situation to be in.</p>
      <p>"I don't think he's very bright, I don't think he really understands the way in which he behaves."</p>
      <p>She admitted she felt "ashamed" that she did not challenge him about his comments.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Chris Bryant, a former Labour minister, said the Duke should be stripped of taxpayer funding following his “car crash” <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/royal-family/2019/11/18/duchess-york-tells-friends-buck-stops-prince-andrews-secretary/">BBC interview about Jeffrey Epstein</a>, the convicted sex offender.</p>
      <p>Liberal Democrat Chuka Umunna called on the 59-year-old royal to retire from public life, saying he had “done more to undermine the monarchy than any other person in his lifetime”.</p>
      <p>He said the Duke should “do the right thing” by flying to the US to give evidence, or retire from public life. </p>
      <p>“I just think he's a complete disgrace,” he added. “I cannot believe the interview that happened. I do not understand why public figures, particularly politicians, have been pulling their punches on this.</p>

      <p>“He has let down the institution, I think the lack of self-awareness is breath-taking, he should go to the U.S, give evidence where needed and do the right thing as he's done too many of the wrong things so far.”</p>
      <p>“If he was a politician… he would have been forced to resign ages ago.”</p>
      <p>Prospective SNP MP Hannah Bardell tweeted: “We the taxpayers fund the lifestyle and lives of the likes of Prince Andrew. Time to reflect very seriously on all of that.”</p>
      <p>Shadow sports minister Rosena Allin-Khan said: “Prince Andrew continues to be out of step with the British public, I welcome his corporate partners withdrawing support from his Pitch@Palace initiative.”</p>
      <p>Responding to Ms Smith’s claims, a Buckingham Palace spokesman said: "HRH has undertaken a considerable amount of work in the Middle East over a period of years and has many friends from the region.</p>
      <p>"He does not tolerate racism in any form."</p>
