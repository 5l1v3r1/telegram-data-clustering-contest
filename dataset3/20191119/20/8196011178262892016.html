      <p>How to plump, hydrate and get rid of spots fast before your Christmas party.</p>
      <p>For the most part, I don’t believe there are true quick fixes when it comes to skin. As an organ, it needs to be treated with respect and understood. Have you ever heard someone refer to quick fixes for heart health? I would guess probably not.</p>
      <p>There are a few circumstances where you will need quick skin fixes or more aptly, quick recovery tactics — even if you have a very thorough, hard working skincare routine.</p>
      <p>In this bracket you’ll find: weddings, school reunions, dates, balls or galas, BNOs (big nights out), and of course, Christmas parties.</p>
      <p>The pressure to look infallible is higher than ever when you have a high-definition camera attached to your hand at all times and although I don’t agree with the skin standard set by Filter Society, I will still help you find a snappy solution for the skin woes that will make you feel less than confident.</p>
      <p>Lines and wrinkles are caused by a decrease or degradation of collagen and elastin, the skin’s structural proteins, so they can’t be solved inan instant and they indeed weren’t caused in an instant either. .</p>
      <p>However, if you and your skin are very hydrated, your skin will be physically plumper, making lines and wrinkles less noticeable — this isn’t a long-term fix by any walk of the imagination, but when you don’t have time to fully support the skin’s structure, it will help temporarily improve how your skin looks.</p>
      <p>The night before your big event, apply lashings of a plumping hyaluronic acid serum — something with more than one type of hyaluronic acid will be best for this, such as Declare Ocean’s Best Hyaluron Triple Booster (€59.50, <a href="https://www.theskinnerd.com/">theskinnerd.com</a> and selected pharmacies and salons).</p>

      <p>Hyaluronic acid pulls moisture towards it and when you have both low molecular weight and high molecular weight in a product, it’ll hydrate deeper in the skin and plump up the skin’s surface simultaneously.</p>
      <p>Top it with an overnight hydration mask or night cream, like the IMAGE Skincare Vital C Overnight Hydration Masque (€78, <a href="https://www.theskinnerd.com/">theskinnerd.com</a> and selected salons) which contains hyaluronic acid, vitamin C and blue-green algae for hydration, smoothing and brightening, or Skingredients Skin Good Fats (€42.00, <a href="https://www.skingredients.com/">skingredients.com</a> and selected salons, pharmacies and department stores) that contains skin-native fat ceramide NP plus other fats to seal in hydration and soften the upper layers of the skin.</p>
      <p>This means that you’ll keep that hydration for longer and if you want supreme, supreme results, pop on a hydrating sheet mask for half an hour before you apply your makeup too.</p>
      <p>So, that’s dent-popping out of the way. How about those big, red, angry spots that most certainly weren’t invited?</p>
      <p>If you have a salicylic acid cleanser on-hand, cleanse with it and then re-apply it on just the spot for about 2 minutes before washing it off.</p>
      <p>I actually keep a bottle of ACNAUT Active Lotion (€26, <a href="https://www.theskinnerd.com/">theskinnerd.com</a> and selected pharmacies) in my personal skincare kit for the annoying lumps - it dries them out and brings them down greatly by the next day.</p>
      <p>If you’re really, really stuck and the spot becomes more swollen and large prior to applying your makeup, ice it for a few minutes. Icing it will constrict blood vessels, helping to bring down swelling.</p>
      <p>Another pro tip for looking that extra bit better in a way that people can’t put their finger on is spritzing both prior to makeup application and after.</p>
      <p>Celebs, skin experts and makeup artists swear by the Caudalie Beauty Elixir (€13.50, selected pharmacies and department stores) due to its soothing and hydrating ingredients.</p>
      <p>So, go forth and party and remember to remove your makeup before bed your head hits the pillow — no need to do a proper thorough cleanse, just get the makeup off or convince your partner, housemate or talented cat to do it for you.</p>
      <h3>THE NERDIE PICK</h3>

      <p>The Seoulista Super Hydration Instant Facial is one of the main sheet masks I reach for so having a kit that pairs Seoulista’s Rosy Hands Instant Manicure and Rosy Toes Instant Pedicure with it is a godsend.</p>
      <p>Pop your Instant Facial, Instant Pedicure and Instant Manicure on at the same time to save on those all essential getting ready minutes. And then politely ask your partner, housemate or talented cat to bring your cup of tea (or glass of wine) up to your mouth for you.</p>
      <p>■ Seoulista Let It Glow Super Snow Splash Collection (€22, <a href="https://www.theskinnerd.com/">theskinnerd.com</a> and selected pharmacies nationwide)</p>
