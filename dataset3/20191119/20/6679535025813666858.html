      <h2>Plea claims institute not providing adequate quota for differently abled for PG programmes</h2>

      <p>The Delhi High Court on Tuesday issued notice to the Centre and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) on a petition claiming that the premier institution was not providing adequate reservation to persons with disabilities (PWD) in its post graduate programme.</p>
      <p>A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice C. Hari Shankar sought the response on the plea by NGO Prhari Sahyog Association, which has alleged that there is “non-inclusiveness of PWD” in the institute.</p>
      <p>The NGO, in its petition filed through advocate Gaurav Kumar Bansal, has contended that AIIMS has failed to adopt the principle of inclusive education as it provided only one PG seat out of a total of 435 advertised in 2018-19, to PWD when it was legally bound to reserve 5% of seats for PWD.</p>
      <p>The petition has also claimed that the United Nation Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities makes it mandatory for their member States to adopt the principle of inclusive education. It has urged the court to call for a status report from AIIMS indicating the efforts made by it to provide inclusive education to PWD.</p>
