      <p>The project centers on “wildly talented high school girls soccer players who become the (un)lucky survivors of a plane crash deep in the Ontario wilderness.”</p>
      <p>According to Showtime:<i> “Yellowjackets chronicles their descent from a complicated but thriving team to warring, cannibalistic clans, while also tracking the lives they’ve attempted to piece back together nearly 25 years later, proving that the past is never really past and what began out in the wilderness is far from over.”</i></p>
      <p>Lyle and Nickerson will handle show-running duties.</p>
