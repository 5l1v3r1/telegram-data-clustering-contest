      <h2>James Hunter's verdict on the Black Cats from their FA Cup replay against Gillingham</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T20:39:17+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 20:39</time> by <a rel="author">James Hunter</a></address>
      <p>Sunderland are out of the FA Cup following a miserable defeat in their first-round replay at Gillingham.</p>
      <p>Brandon Hanlan scored with the only on-target shot of the game in extra time to send the hosts through.</p>
      <p>The Black Cats failed to pose a genuine threat, with Will Grigg wasting their best chance when well placed on the edge of the box and firing wide.</p>
      <p>Here's how James Hunter rated the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland-afc">Sunderland</a> players following their FA Cup first-round exit:</p>
      <p>LEE BURGE 6</p>
      <p>Little chance with the goal, and that was the only on-target shot he faced</p>
      <p>BRANDON TAYLOR 6</p>
      <p>Youngster looked solid playing on the right-hand side of a back three</p>
      <p>ALIM OZTURK 6</p>
      <p>Not 100 percent fit but was defensively sound and lasted the initial 90mins</p>
      <p>LAURENS DE BOCK 6</p>
      <p>A stand-in centre-back, but did a decent job</p>
      <p>LUKE Oâ€™NIEN 6</p>
      <p>Got forward down the right but had to be careful after picking up a booking</p>
      <p>MAX POWER 6</p>
      <p>Came closest to a goal when Bonham had to claw away his miscued cross</p>
      <p>GRANT LEADBITTER 6</p>
      <p>Competitive but without standing out in central midfield</p>
      <p>CHRIS MAGUIRE 5</p>
      <p>Disappointing lack of quality when he got in and around the box</p>
      <p>DENVER HUME 6</p>
      <p>OK defensively but offered little going forward</p>
      <p>DUNCAN WATMORE 5</p>
      <p>Saw little of the ball and was taken off just after the hour</p>
      <p>WILL GRIGG 5</p>
      <p>Put one shot narrowly wide in the second half, but otherwise received no service whatsoever</p>
      <p>SUBS</p>
      <p>AIDEN McGEADY 5</p>
      <p>For Watmore 64mins. Set one chance up for Grigg, otherwise quiet</p>
      <p>JACK BAINBRIDGE 6</p>
      <p>For Ozturk 90mins. Came on for the extra 30 minutes and did OK</p>
      <p>DYLAN McGEOUCH 5</p>
      <p>For Hume 105mins. Made no impact</p>
      <p>LEE CONNELLY 6</p>
      <p>For Grigg 113mins. Just a cameo from the youngster</p>
      <p>NOT USED: Patterson, Mumba, Sammut</p>
