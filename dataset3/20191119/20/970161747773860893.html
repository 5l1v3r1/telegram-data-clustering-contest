      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/boris-johnson/">Boris Johnson</a> and Jeremy Corbyn are going head-to-head in a General Election TV debate.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister and Labour leader are live on ITV until 9pm, in the first of a series of political debates ahead of the December 12 election.</p>
      <p>The two men most likely to lead the country after the December 12 vote have already clashed on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/brexit/">Brexit</a>, the union and coalitions.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister blamed a ‘deadlocked’ parliament for the election and blocking Brexit, while warning against a coalition between Mr Corbyn and Nicola Sturgeon. He suggested such a government would lead to two referendums – one on Brexit and Scottish independence.</p>
      <p>Mr Corbyn argued that the Conservatives are failing on the economy, climate crisis, NHS and Brexit. He added that there had already been nine years of chaotic coalitions. </p>
