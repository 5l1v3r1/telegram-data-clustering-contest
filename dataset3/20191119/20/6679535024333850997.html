      <h1>MP wears mask to Lok Sabha</h1>
      <h2>Members call for joint action, keeping aside party politics</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T20:03:33+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 20:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Bindu-Shajan-Perappadan-319/" target="_blank">Bindu Shajan Perappadan</a></address>
      <p>Driving home the adverse impact of air pollution, Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar of the Trinamool Congress (TMC) wore a mask while participating in a discussion on air pollution and climate change in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Calling the current state of air pollution a “national emergency”, she demanded that the government should launch a ‘Swachh Hawa Mission’ (clean air mission) on the lines of the Swachh Bharat Mission. Though she took off her mask after being urged by the members of the Treasury Bench, the MP said that it was time the Central government took note of the seriousness of the problem and initiated corrective steps.</p>
      <p>During the discussion initiated by Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, the MPs noted that party politics should be kept aside to seriously deal with air pollution, and suggested that a high-level task force headed by the Prime Minister be put in place.</p>
      <p>BJP MPs in the Lok Sabha said the Delhi government had done little to improve the situation and was instead shifting the blame on farmers in the neighbouring States.</p>
      <h3>‘Don’t blame farmers’</h3>
      <p>BJP member representing West Delhi Parvesh Sahib Singh slammed the Delhi government for blaming stubble burning for the pollution in Delhi-NCR and ignoring major pollutants, including vehicles and dust. “The Delhi government has spent several crores of rupees on advertisements but has done little to curb pollution. They have again spent on publicising the odd-even scheme but not taken steps to increase the number of public buses,” he noted with both Pinaki Misra (BJD) and Manish Tewari (Congress) stating that stubble burning is not a major contributor to pollution in Delhi and the farmers should not be vilified.</p>
      <p>Preneet Kaur (Congress) said farmers of Punjab are being subjected to harsh criticism and being projected as almost villains for pollution in Delhi as “rhetoric is getting better of sound rational thinking”.</p>
      <p>A meeting of a parliamentary committee on the issue of air pollution in the national capital is scheduled for Wednesday, after the absence of most of its members and senior officials in its last meeting sparked outrage. Sources said Mr. Birla pulled up some of the key officials, who had skipped the panel’s meeting on November 15, and asked them to ensure that it is not repeated.</p>
