      <p><b>PodSkinz with Carabiner</b> ($8.95) No one buys a Porsche, BMW or Mercedes-Benz and parks it on the street – the same should be true to a pair of AirPods.

The PodSkinz with Carabiner helps you avoid worrying about scratches, scrapes, bumps and everything else you can think of from your daily grind. To make life even easier and handy, use the sleek carabiner to attache the case to your bags, backpack or even your bike.</p>
