      <h1>RNC Raises More than Half Million Dollars from Don Jr. Book 'Triggered'</h1>
      <h2>The Republican National Committee (RNC) has netted more than half a million dollars by selling special signed copies of the new book from Donald Trump, Jr., Breitbart News has learned exclusively.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T20:41:31+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 20:41</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Boyle</a></address>
      <p>The RNC confirmed to Breitbart News that the party committee raised more than $500,000 by giving special, signed copies of the new Trump, Jr., book <i>Triggered</i> to people who donate $50 or more to the RNC. The RNC has also had to buy more copies of the book to keep up with public demand, too, an RNC official said.</p>
      <p>Since the money raised figure is a net gain, that means the party raised $500,000 plus off the signed books after covering the costs of buying the books.</p>
      <p>“The media would have you believe we stocked a warehouse with copies of this book, but that couldn’t be further from the truth,” RNC spokesman Steve Guest told Breitbart News. “Don’s book has been a fundraising home run for the party, and the overwhelming demand means we have even more resources heading into 2020.”</p>
      <p>Trump, Jr., <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/11/13/donald-trump-jr-triggered-book-hits-number-one-on-new-york-times-bestseller-list/">hit number one</a> on the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller list with the release of <i>Triggered</i>, and has been on a whirlwind book tour across the country selling copies of it and triggering establishment media figures like the hosts of <i>The View</i> during a particularly memorable appearance on that show.</p>
      <p>“You could erase every book sold to supporters through the RNC and Don still would have sold double the amount of books as the second place finisher on the <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers list,” a source close to Trump, Jr., added in a comment to Breitbart News.</p>
      <p>The RNC has been giving out signed copies of the book to anyone who makes donations of at least $50 via a special website through the party’s <a href="https://secure.winred.com/rnc/don-jr-signed-book/">online fundraising platform</a>. While the RNC did not provide the exact number of Trump, Jr., books that have been sold through this service, given that the minimum donation to get one is $50, that means it could be as many as 10,000 copies, as the RNC raised more than half a million so far.</p>
