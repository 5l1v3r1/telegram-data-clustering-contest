      <p>Live from Salford in Greater Manchester, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn go head to head in their first TV debate.</p>
      <p>The leaders are making their opening speeches before taking questions for the audience. </p>
      <p><b>Jeremy Corbyn</b> went first with the opening statement.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The election gives a real choice, he says, about the future.</li>
        <li>Labour is offering real hope. The Tory government is failing. He says he will get Brexit sorted by giving people the final say, and he will implement what they decide.</li>
        <li>Too many policies are failing. Labour will govern for the many not the few.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Boris Johnson </b>said there is only one reason to have an election; to remove the block in parliament, get Brexit done, and to then unleash this country’s potential.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Under Corbyn there would be dither and delay, and two referendums.</li>
        <li>Together, let’s take this country forward, he says.</li>
      </ul>
