      <p>ATLANTA -- A white 16-year-old girl is accused of plotting to attack a mostly black church in a north Georgia city, where police say she planned to kill worshippers because of their race.</p>
      <p>Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church has a predominantly black congregation, Gainesville Police Chief Jay Parrish said in a Tuesday statement.</p>
      <p>"Our investigation indicated the church was targeted by the juvenile based on the racial demographic of the church members," he said.</p>
      <p>Students, school administrators and law officers worked together to thwart a "potentially horrific incident," he added.</p>
      <p>The plot came to light when Gainesville High School students told administrators the 16-year-old had a notebook with detailed plans to kill worshippers at the church, Parrish said.</p>
      <p>"It just grieves my spirit on a number of different levels, one that the intentions of this young person were so calculated to do great harm against people who just simply had no knowledge of such a plot," said The Rev. Rose Johnson, director of the Newtown Florist Club, a civil rights organization founded in Gainesville 70 years ago.</p>
      <p>The girl is charged with criminal attempt to commit murder, the police chief said. She's being held in a youth detention centre in Gainesville.</p>
      <p>Specific details of the alleged plot haven't been released, but Parrish said it came to light Friday when school administrators contacted police.</p>
      <p>"We're just very pleased that our police department acted so swiftly, and the police department in conjunction with our school administrators were just on top of the situation," Johnson said.</p>
      <p>Police did not release the girl's name Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Gainesville is about 80 kilometres northeast of Atlanta. It's a city of just over 40,000 people, about 17% of whom are African-American.</p>
