      <h1>Gary Lineker sends brutal message to Spurs chairman Daniel Levy as Mauricio Pochettino sacked</h1>
      <h2>Gary Lineker has been speaking about Mauricio Pochettino and Tottenham's decision to part ways with him</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T20:41:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 20:41</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Clarke</a></address>
      <p>Tottenham have sacked Mauricio Pochettino after five years at the club and that has naturally led the reaction aplenty from fans and even former players.</p>
      <p>One of the most prominent former players with a voice in the game is naturally Gary Lineker, the ex-Tottenham striker turned Match of the Day presenter.</p>
      <p>Lineker has been quick to criticise the decision which has been made by club chairman Daniel Levy, who himself has admitted it was a call he came to reluctantly.</p>
      <p>Spurs currently sit 14th in the Premier League ahead of facing West Ham United on the road this weekend and the pressure was already building on Pochettino way before this week.</p>
      <p>The Argentinian has been the subject of speculation surrounding his future for months ever since he suggested that if he won the Champions League final against Liverpool in June that it might be his last rodeo with the club.</p>
      <p>A summer of discontent followed for Pochettino and that has stretched well into the autumn, with Levy issuing this statement tonight.</p>
      <p>"We were extremely reluctant to make this change," said Spurs chairman Daniel Levy.</p>
      <p>"It is not a decision the board has taken lightly, nor in haste. Regrettably domestic results at the end of last season and the beginning of this season have been extremely disappointing."</p>
      <p>It has led to a negative reaction from Lineker and here is what he has had to say.</p>
      <p>"Mauricio Pochettino has been sacked by Spurs," <a href="https://twitter.com/GaryLineker/status/1196878363568279552">Lineker tweeted</a>. "He helped the club to punch massively above their weight for years. Good luck with finding a better replacement....ainâ€™t gonna happen."</p>
