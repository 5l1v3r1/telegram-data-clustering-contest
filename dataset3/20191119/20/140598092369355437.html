      <h1>GCSEs belong in the Victorian era along with dunce caps, says head of Haberdashers Aske's</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T20:32:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 20:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/camilla-turner/" target="_blank">Camilla Turner</a></address>
      <p>GCSEs belong in the Victoria era along with dunce caps, a leading headteacher has said.</p>
      <p>Rose Hardy, headmistress at the £19,300-a-year Haberdashers’ Aske’s School for Girls, said there is a growing frustration among school leaders about the public exams for 16-year-olds.</p>
      <p>She said that Year 10 students get put on the “terrible treadmill” of GCSEs and are “actually having a very tough time”.  </p>
      <p>Speaking at the Girls’ School Association annual conference in Bristol, she went on: “I think many heads would say that in thirty years time, maybe sooner, we’ll look back and say what we were doing now with young people is the equivalent of what the Victorians did with building their school rooms with windows high up so they couldn’t look out, and putting people in dunce caps.”</p>
      <p>Mrs Hardy is the latest in a string of headteachers to criticise GCSEs as not being fit for purpose, despite undergoing extensive reforms in recent years.</p>
      <p>Jenny Brown, head of City of London School for Girls, added: “Frankly if we were being really brave we would all just say ‘right that’s it, no more GCSEs, farewell’. They are outmoded, uninteresting and draining frankly, I personally don’t think they deserve the space they get.”  </p>
      <p>Last month,<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/10/04/exams-could-replaced-artificial-intelligence-future-private/"> a private school chief predicted that exams could be replaced by artificial intelligence in the future.</a>  </p>
      <p>Mike Buchanan, executive director of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference which represents 296 of the country's leading private schools, including Eton College and Harrow School, said that GCSEs can be a “very dry diet” for some students.</p>
      <p>He said elite private schools could trial new technologies to see what works, and then the model could be rolled out nationally.</p>
      <p>“There are a dozen HMC schools using AI systems and more that are seriously looking at it,” he said. “And there are dozens of schools around the world doing it.”</p>
      <p>Rather than being awarded grades for individual GCSEs, 16-year-old students could in the future be given performance reports which contain far more detailed information about their abilities.</p>
      <p>Figures released earlier this year revealed that private school pupils are now taking fewer GCSEs with a growing number of the country’s leading fee-paying schools now encouraging pupils to make space in the day for other pursuits.</p>
