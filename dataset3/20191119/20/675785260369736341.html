      <h1>Gary Lineker's brutal message to Tottenham chiefs after sacking Mauricio Pochettino</h1>
      <h2>Gary Lineker has questioned the club's decision to axe the boss who led them to the Champions League final for the first time last season</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T20:37:26+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 20:37</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Maltby, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matt-maltby/</a></address>
      <p>Former Tottenham striker Gary Lineker has claimed that Spurs will struggle to find a better manager than Mauricio Pochettino after opting to sack the Argentinian.</p>
      <p>Lineker was among the high-profile names to react to the shock news on Tuesday night that <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> chairman Daniel Levy has relieved Pochettino of his duties.</p>
      <p>And the Spurs hero questioned the club's decision to dispense with a man who led them to the Champions League final for the first time last season.</p>
      <p>Lineker said on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> : "He helped the club to punch massively above their weight for years. Good luck with finding a better replacement....ain't gonna happen."</p>

      <p>Former England midfielder Trevor Sinclair blamed Totteham's players for letting their manager down, tweeting: "Tottenham players need to have a look at themselves in the mirror tonight after what Poch has done for them Pochettino."</p>
      <p>Former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> defender Jamie Carragher backed Pochettino to be back managing in the Premier League soon.</p>
      <p>He tweeted: "I said a few weeks ago I felt this project had ran its course, I thought there would be a change at the end of the season with either the manager or players changing. Pochettino has been a brilliant manager for Spurs &amp; will be back in the PL sooner rather than later!."</p>

      <p>Pochettino was at the helm for 293 games and delivered four successive top-four Premier League finishes, challenging for the title in 2015/16 and 2016/17.</p>
      <p>He also memorably guided the club to their first Champions League final last season, but they fell short in the Madrid showpiece in a 2-0 defeat to Liverpool.</p>
      <p>His assistant Jesus Perez, and coaches Miguel D'Agostino and Antoni Jimenez have also left the club.</p>
      <p>Pochettino, who had to contend with playing home games at Wembley for 18 months, viewed the run to the Madrid final as the end of a chapter and warned of a "painful rebuild" this summer.</p>
      <p>However, Spurs, whose transfers are controlled by Levy, were unable to move out a host of players who either wanted to leave or Pochettino wanted rid of and results suffered.</p>
      <p>They won just three of their first 14 games of the Premier League season, were hammered 7-2 by Bayern Munich in the Champions League and lost to League Two Colchester in the Carabao Cup.</p>
