      <p>Mauricio Pochettino has left Tottenham after five and a half years at the club.</p>
      <p>It has been an eventful and swashbuckling ride during his time in north London full of ups and downs.</p>
      <p>Here, the PA news agency charts the highs and the lows during that time.</p>
      <h3>Highs</h3>
      <h4>Moura’s Miracle</h4>

      <h4>Cutting Real Madrid down to size</h4>
      <p>Playing at Wembley was not an altogether enjoyable experience for Spurs, but there were some memorable nights there, notably the slaying of the European champions. They put Real Madrid, still with peak Cristiano Ronaldo in their side, to the sword at the national stadium in a real Red Letter Day. Dele Alli put them ahead in the first half and was rewarded for an outstanding display with a second after the break. Christian Eriksen put them 3-0 up soon after before Ronaldo got one back late in the game. The result and the performance was an announcement that Spurs had arrived on the European stage.</p>
      <h4>Getting one over on Pep</h4>

      <h4>Saying farewell in style</h4>
      <p>The 2016-17 season was Tottenham’s final year at their famous White Hart Lane stadium before its demolition and Pochettino was determined for them to say goodbye to their home in style. And his side answered his wish as they went the entire campaign unbeaten in front of their home fans, winning 17 of their 19 games. They did it scoring 47 goals and conceding only nine. The final ever game there on a day of celebration and nostalgia was a 2-1 win over Manchester United.</p>
      <h4>Ending Stamford Bridge hoodoo</h4>
      <p>It must have felt like Tottenham were never going to win at Stamford Bridge again as their hoodoo at the home of their London rivals had gone on 28 years. In 2017-18 the majority of their players had not even been born when Gary Lineker scored the goal that gave them their last victory there, but they finally stopped the rot with three points which were vital to their Champions League qualification. They fell behind to Alvaro Morata’s header, but Eriksen levelled up before the break with a fine strike from distance before Alli continued his penchant of scoring big-game goals with a second-half double.</p>
      <h3>Lows</h3>
      <h4>Falling at the final hurdle</h4>

      <h4>Seven hell</h4>
      <p>Spurs went into the record books for all the wrong reasons after the 7-2 Champions League hammering at the hands of Bayern Munich. The performance might not have been quite as bad as the scoreline suggests but it was Pochettino’s heaviest defeat as a manager. It was also the first time Spurs had conceded seven at home in a major competition in their 137-year history and the first time any English club had let in that many in a European competition. It was an early black mark at their new stadium and an embarrassing night for the club.</p>
      <h4>Final-day capitulation</h4>

      <h4>FA Cup heartache</h4>
      <p>Spurs had lost in the FA Cup semi-final 12 months earlier so when they got back there in April 2018 there was a sense that this was their time. That was only heightened as playing against Manchester United at Wembley, their home ground for the season, an electric start was rewarded with an early goal from Alli. But they failed to take further early chances as Alexis Sanchez levelled and then Ander Herrera sent Jose Mourinho’s men to the final. It did nothing to shake off the ‘Spursy’ tag – perennial nearly men.</p>
      <h4>Self-imposed transfer ban</h4>
      <p>Having delivered Tottenham towards the top of English football, Pochettino’s ability to take them to the next level was seemingly hampered by a self-imposed transfer ban which saw them go 18 months and through two transfer windows without bringing any new players into the club. It meant the Argentinian was not able to add any depth to his squad, which was shattered from their World Cup exertions, nor could he freshen it up following four years of the same players hearing largely the same message.</p>
