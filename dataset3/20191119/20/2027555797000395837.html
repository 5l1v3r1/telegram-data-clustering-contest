      <h1>Ahead of Gaganyaan, Isro gears up for satellite docking</h1>

      <p>Ahead of its first manned mission, Gaganyaan in early 2022, the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) is gearing up for a highly critical operation: A space docking experiment to link two small satellites in low-Earth orbit.</p>
      <p>The satellites are likely to be launched aboard a Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) within the next six months. Once the spacecraft attains the desired altitude, the extremely tough experiment will be initiated.</p>
      <p>Christened SPADEX, the docking experiment will combine two spacecraft, a Chaser and a Target. The technology demonstration will be in controlling one spacecraft from the Attitude Control System of the other spacecraft in the docked condition.</p>
      <p>Once the docking is achieved, the Chaser and Target will be separated so that they carry out their designated experiments with payloads. This technology will be a forerunner to future planetary missions including crew transfer and international participation. Â </p>
      <p>A successful completion of this 'technology demonstration' experiment is expected to give the space agency the confidence to ferry astronauts to a future Indian space station and back. The vehicle carrying the astronauts will be designed to precisely dock with the station.</p>
      <p>At the Bengaluru Tech Summit 2019 here, a top Isro official informed that the preparations for the docking experiment plan was well on course. In this regard, he articulated the need to forge partnerships with foreign partners for followup systems, robotic arms, robotic manipulators and more.</p>

        <b>Russia to train Gaganauts</b>
      </p>
      <p>In another development on the Gaganyaan project, a top Russian space official has reportedly confirmed that the 'Gaganauts' chosen for the manned mission would begin their training sessions at the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre in Russia sometime in 2020.</p>
      <p>On September 4, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced that Russia will help train Indian astronauts for the Gaganyaan project. This was part of a joint statement Modi made with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Vladivostok. The training is expected to commence after the final selection of three astronauts for the mission are selected by the Indian armed forces.</p>
