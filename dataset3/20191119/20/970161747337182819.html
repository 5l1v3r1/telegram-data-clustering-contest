      <p>This is the moment an eight year-old sex abuse victim was rescued from the pedophile who snatched her as she walked with her mother.</p>
      <p>A team of tactical officers search the Texas hotel room and do not immediately find the girl. But she emerges from a laundry basket only after her abductor, 51-year-old Michael Webb, had been handcuffed.</p>
      <p>‘Here she is. Got her, we got her, we got her,’ and officer is heard shouting in the footage released this week.</p>
      <p>The girl, who is not named because she is a minor and sex assault victim, was snatched in broad daylight as she walked with her mother in a Fort Worth, Texas neighborhood on May 18.</p>
      <p>A doorbell camera captured the moment the girl was abducted and shows the victim’s mother screaming, ‘Help me! Help me please! My daughter just got kidnapped!’</p>

      <p>Later that night, a clerk at a the WoodSprings Suits hotel in Fort Worth called police and reported suspicious activity in one of the rooms.</p>

      <p>A Forest Hill police sergeant inspected Webb’s hotel room, but did not find the child and left. That sergeant was later fired.</p>
      <p>Webb later admitted that told the girl to stay hidden in the laundry basket, threatening to hurt her and her family if she refused.</p>
      <p>Pastor Jeff King, a friend of the girl’s family, continued searching for the girl and called 911 after he spotted Webb’s car in the hotel parking lot hours later.</p>
      <p>A team of officers from the Homeland Security Department, the FBI and the Fort Worth Police Department then returned to the room, found the girl and arrested Webb.</p>

      <p>Erin Nealy Cox, US attorney for the Norther District of Texas, said: ‘When they find her,you hear how just emotional it is for everyone. They are just so happy and relieved that they have her.’</p>
      <p>In an interview with detectives, Webb broke down in tears and confessed to kidnapping the girl.</p>
      <p>He was convicted in September and sentenced to life in prison on November 14. He is also facing sexual assault and kidnapping charges in Tarrant County.</p>
      <p>At Webb’s sentencing hearing, the girl’s father said that if Webb ‘has to spend his days in a box until his final breaths, I suppose that will do.’</p>
