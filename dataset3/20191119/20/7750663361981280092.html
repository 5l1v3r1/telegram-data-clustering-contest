      <h1>West Bromwich Albion to cash in on Nathan Ferguson?</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/west-brom-albion/"><b>West Bromwich Albion</b></a> are reportedly prepared to cash in on <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/nathan-ferguson/"><b>Nathan Ferguson</b></a> during the January transfer window.</h2>

      <p>While the 19-year-old has made 13 starts in the Championship this season, less than a year remains on the contract of the academy graduate.</p>
      <p>Despite West Brom being keen to agree fresh terms with the full-back, the <i>Express &amp; Star</i> claims that the Baggies are not against parting ways with the prospect at the start of 2020.</p>
      <p>Ferguson has naturally emerged as a target for Premier League clubs, with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/spurs/"><b>Tottenham Hotspur</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/crystal-palace/"><b>Crystal Palace</b></a> said to be admirers of his ability.</p>
      <p>Earlier this season, it was also suggested that <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/juventus/"><b>Juventus</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/atletico-madrid/"><b>Atletico Madrid</b></a> were monitoring the situation.</p>
      <p>Providing that he does not pen a new deal at The Hawthorns, Ferguson can hold talks with foreign clubs in January.</p>
