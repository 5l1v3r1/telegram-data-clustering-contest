      <p>There was one hell of a shock for <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/">Emmerdale</a> viewers tonight as paedophile Maya made a return.</p>
      <p>As the hour-long episode began, David and Leyla steeled themselves to tell son Jacob that his abuser was set to be released from prison.</p>
      <p>They were surprised that the teen, who was besotted with his teacher lover, took the news so calmly.</p>
      <p>But it later transpired that Jacob was cooking up a plan to reunite with the older woman.</p>
      <aside>I was NOT prepared for what i've just seen!</aside>
      <p>David intercepted him going to see her, and brought him back to the village, begging him to move on.</p>
      <p>Maya had ignored Jacob's text messages and David warned it was a sign she didn't want to hear from him.</p>
      <p>Any contact would result in her heading straight back to prison.</p>
      <p>At the end of the episode, Maya was seen leaving jail... and then there was a bombshell glimpse of a pregnancy bump!</p>

      <p>So, does this mean that actress Louis Clein is back with the cast of the soap for a while, and Maya will return to the village?</p>
      <p>Will she and Jacob reunite and raise the baby together? Is the baby even Jacob's? Could it be David's? Eek.</p>
      <p>Viewers were seriously impressed with the plot twist.</p>
