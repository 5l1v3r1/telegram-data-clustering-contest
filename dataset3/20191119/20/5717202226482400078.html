      <h1>Arsenal fans react as Henrikh Mkhitaryan comments on Arsene Wenger</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T20:15:58+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 20:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/will-butcher/" target="_blank">Will Butcher</a></address>
      <p>Henrikh Mkhitaryan has been quoted as saying that he loved playing under Arsene Wenger at Arsenal, following his move from Manchester United in January 2018 – and Gunners fans have reacted by hammering the Roma loanee.</p>
      <p>Mkhitaryan left Arsenal in the summer to join AS Roma on a season-long loan after the 30-year-old struggled since the arrival of Unai Emery as manager. Indeed, he managed just six goals for Arsenal in an entire season under Emery.</p>
      <p>The signing of Nicolas Pepe, as well as the breakthrough of young talent including Reiss Nelson, Joe Willock, Gabriel Martinelli and Bukayo Saka was enough for Arsenal to sanction Mkhitaryan’s exit. He is currently injured at Roma.</p>
      <p>Asked about his time at Arsenal, Mkhitaryan underlined his love for Wenger despite playing under the Frenchman for only the second half of the 2017-18 season. Indeed, the majority of his time at Arsenal has been playing under Emery.</p>
      <p>“Playing under him was a pleasure,” <a href="https://tribuna.com/en/arsenal/news/3511246/">Mkhitaryan told FourFourTwo, as quoted by Tribuna</a>. “To all the players he said: ‘Play soccer and have fun – if you’re doing something and having fun, it means you’re doing it right.'”</p>
      <p>Because the former Borussia Dortmund star has only recently moved to The Emirates, he has a contract at Arsenal until the summer of 2021. It remains to be seen how much Arsenal would charge for the attacker now.</p>
      <p>Arsenal fans reacted to the player’s comments on Twitter, with many left angered. Supporters feel that Mkhitaryan struggled even in the time under Wenger, as did the rest of the team. One fan has begged the winger to leave on a permanent basis.</p>
