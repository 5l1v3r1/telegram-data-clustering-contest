      <h1>Tipperary farming: Glanbia’s decision on milk price is ‘inexplicable’</h1>
      <h2>ICMSA wants decision reviewed</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T20:30:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 20:30</time> by <a rel="author">Tipperary Star reporter</a></address>
      <p>The decision by Glanbia Ireland to hold its milk at the October level of 28cpl has been described as “inexplicable” by ICMSA national dairy chair Gerald Quain.</p>
      <p>Calling on Glanbia to immediately review its decision, Mr Quain said the decision completely ignored recent strong climbs in the Ornua PPI.</p>
      <p>He pointed out that the Ornua Index now translated back to 31.5cpl with the Glanbia price now at 29cpl, which includes a 1cpl support, was a full 2.5cpl beneath that.</p>
      <p>“Glanbia suppliers have been in contact with ICMSA to express their anger at the decision and I have to say that I think they’re fully entitled to feel that anger,” he said.</p>
      <p>The dairy chair said that the price now left a 400,000 litre Glanbia supplier about €850 short on his or her October milk cheque, he said.</p>
      <p>He said that all market indicators and data point to a milk price of at least 31cpl and ICMSA was calling on the board of Glanbia Ireland to review its decision and immediately raise the October milk price to that level.</p>
      <p>Glanbia’s new Fixed Milk Price Scheme has a base price of 31 cent per litre (cpl) (including VAT) at reference milk constituents of 3.6% and 3.3% protein.</p>
      <p>The one-year voluntary scheme will run from January to December 2020.</p>
      <p>The key elements are: a base price of 31cpl (including VAT) at 3.6% butterfat and 3.3% protein; any support payment made by Glanbia Co-operative Society to members would be paid on top of the fixed milk price; qualifying applicants for the one-year scheme will be required to be customers (existing or future) of GI Agri; as a customer of GI Agri, applicants will be required to commit to a minimum spend of 5cpl on farm inputs during 2020.</p>
