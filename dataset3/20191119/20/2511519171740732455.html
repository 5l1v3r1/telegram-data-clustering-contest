      <p>When we heard that <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/GwynethPaltrow">Gwyneth Paltrow</a>’s <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/wellness">wellness</a> website <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/goop">Goop</a> was <a href="http://go.redirectingat.com/?id=44681X1458326&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgoop.com%2Fwellness%2Ffitness%2Fgoop-league-austin-2019-recap%2F&amp;sref=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/trampoline-exercise-gwyneth-paltrow-goop-class-ny-a9188541.html">promoting</a> an invite-only <a href="http://go.redirectingat.com/?id=44681X1458326&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgoop.com%2Fwellness%2Ffitness%2Ftrampoline-cardio-workout%2F&amp;sref=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/trampoline-exercise-gwyneth-paltrow-goop-class-ny-a9188541.html">workout class</a> in New York City, we were intrigued. When we learned it revolved around personal miniature trampolines, we had to try it. </p>
      <p>According to its <a href="https://www.thenessnyc.com/">website</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thenessnyc/?hl=en">the ness</a> (lower-case only) is an “intimate oasis where fit [ness] meets your [ness]”. It is also a <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/workout">workout</a> studio located on the border of Tribeca and Chinatown, where we spent 50 minutes after work one evening panting and bouncing to the beat of blaring music.   </p>
      <p>Our journey to wellness the Goop way began after confirming our attendance for a 6.45pm class with the help of the ness co-founder Dria Murphy, who started the company alongside Aly Giampolo and Colette Dong.</p>
      <p>We chose to attend a Bounce class, a beat-based, low-impact <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/cardio">cardio</a> workout, rather than a Sculpt class, which focuses on muscle sculpting and sounded tougher. </p>
      <p>When we arrived at the studio, after travelling downtown and up three flights of stairs, we were pleased to find it dimly lit but also bustling with energy. </p>

      <p>The zen-like design is intentional, according to Dong, who explained: "We were inspired by the relaxed vibe of a boho style but wanted something a little more clean and contemporary. We got there by mixing a lot of textures, like hard dark stone and brick with softer elements like green velvet and golden stalks. The windows were a major draw for us and really make the space. There is nothing better than working out in natural light. In NYC, it is such a privilege and a treat to work out in a beautiful space with tons of light. That’s how we want people to feel - gratitude for their circumstance and the bodies that take them through class."</p>
      <p>After we checked in, we were shown to our <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/trampoline">trampoline</a> and introduced to our instructor for the night, Jessica Aronoff, who showed us how to assume the correct bouncing position - a squat, but on the trampoline. </p>
      <p>As the 11 other attendees warmed up around us, we assumed that the class would be relatively easy. We were wrong. </p>
      <p>When Aronoff took her place in front of us on a trampoline of her own and proceeded to teach us a series of moves, jumps and routines, all while maintaining perfect posture and beat, we realised just how rigorous of a workout bouncing actually is. </p>

      <p>If you can remember breathlessly bouncing on a trampoline when you were young, and then imagine tripling that exertion, you can get a good idea of what a Bounce class is like. </p>
      <p>While we managed to keep up in the beginning, when it came to balancing on one foot while bouncing, we struggled. </p>
      <p>For those moments when we couldn’t manage to gather our balance enough not to fall off the trampoline, of which there were quite a few, we resumed our starting position and bounced along to the music. </p>
      <p>By the halfway point, we were dripping with sweat, but also found we couldn’t stop grinning. Whether it was the endorphins or the sheer fun of bouncing around, we’re not sure. </p>

      <p>However, by the 40-minute mark, when we began to cramp on our right side, we were ready to give up and leave.</p>
      <p>We managed to bounce the rest of the way, a feat which we were quite proud of, before winding down with a series of ab workouts and stretches. </p>

      <p>It turns out adding a trampoline base to typical crunches, which are boring and stale, makes the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/exercise">exercise</a> somewhat more-bearable. </p>
      <p>At the end of the class, we congratulated ourselves with a well-earned glass of water and a refreshing spritz of facial mist, which the ness has arranged near the reception area. </p>
      <p>While we had contemplated ways to leave early during the actual class, we found we had a remaining bounce in our step for an hour after the class as we walked home - which had turned into soreness by the next day. </p>

      <p>Overall, we really liked the ness and found that the high-intensity and speed of the workout made the time go by fast. Aronoff and her genuine happiness at teaching the class also helped.  </p>
      <p>And while we’d usually avoid a class that promises near-constant cardio for almost an hour, at the ness we found it was surprisingly tolerable - even fun. </p>
      <p>We would, however, advise those who aren’t coordinated to skip the workout, as balance is definitely required. </p>
      <p>For those extended an invite to join the ness, membership costs $380-a-month for 15 classes, with the option to add unlimited additional classes for $20 each. If you don't want a full membership, classes cost $35 each. </p>
