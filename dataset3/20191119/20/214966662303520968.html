      <h1>Gold Coast wakes to ‘unhealthy’ smoke haze </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T20:38:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 20:38</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.mygc.com.au/author/mstclair/" target="_blank">Monique StClair</a></address>
      <p>The Gold Coast has woken to a thick layer of smoke this morning, after the air quality deteriorated overnight.</p>
      <p>According to the air quality index, we peaked at a rating of almost 150 – an unhealthy rating – around dawn.</p>
      <p>It’s prompted warnings for those with breathing difficulties to remain indoors, and keep breathing medication nearby.</p>
      <p>Since dawn, the rating has dropped off slightly – with winds easing the density of the smoke.</p>
      <p>At the time of writing (6.30am), our rating was sitting at a moderate level of around 90.</p>
      <p>It comes as fire fighters prepare for a day of worsening conditions across the state, as temperatures continue heating up.</p>
      <p>More than 70 blazes are still burning around Queensland.</p>
      <p>On the Gold Coast, we’re in for top temps around 30 degrees, with northwesterly winds shifting around to a stronger northeasterly throughout the afternoon.</p>
      <p>While the fire danger on the coast remains at a ‘very high’ level.</p>
      <p>There are currently no weather warnings for the state.</p>
