      <h1>Social media posts referred to police could show up on DBS background checks despite not being a crime</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T20:31:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 20:31</time> by <a rel="author">Izzy Lyons, Joani Walsh</a></address>
      <p>Social media posts referred to police but deemed as non-criminal could still show up on DBS background checks.</p>
      <p>Forces across the country record ‘<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/09/10/police-urge-public-report-insults-hurt-feelings-arent-crimes/">non-crime hate incidents</a>’ on internal systems when the content is considered offensive by a victim “irrespective of whether there is any evidence to identify the hate element”.</p>
      <p>The incident could then show up on an enhanced DBS check carried out by an employer on a prospective employee, regardless of the fact that the individual has not committed a crime. </p>
      <p>The revelation comes as the College of Policing, which issues the guidance to all police forces across the country on how to record non-crime hate incidents, is facing a High Court challenge over whether the rules are lawful. </p>
      <p>The claim is being brought by <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/01/24/man-investigated-police-retweeting-transgender-limerick/">Harry Miller</a>, a 53-year-old man from Lincoln who was investigated by Humberside Police earlier this year after a Twitter user complained that he shared a ‘transphobic limerick’. Even though no crime was committed, sharing the limerick online was recorded as a ‘hate incident’.</p>

      <p>Mr Miller has now launched legal proceedings against both Humberside Police and the College of Policing, arguing that their Hate Crime Operational Guidance is unlawful as it breaches his right to freedom of expression under Article 10 of the Human Rights Act. </p>
      <p>The judicial review in the High Court is expected to commence tomorrow. </p>
      <p>The DBS service, which is responsible for disclosing criminal records, confirmed that non-crime hate incidents can show up on an Enhanced check. </p>
      <p>“An enhanced DBS check shows spent and unspent convictions, cautions plus any information held by local police that’s considered relevant to the role the individual is being considered for,” a spokesman for the DBS service said. “In terms of non–crime hate incidents, these may be disclosed on an Enhanced check if they are considered by the police to be relevant.”</p>
      <p>The decision to disclose additional police information would be made using the quality assurance framework which is agreed by the National Police Chiefs' Council, the spokesman added. </p>
      <p>Mr Miller, a married father of four, was alerted to the investigation by his company directors after they were approached by officers trying to make contact with Mr Miller, he previously told The Daily Telegraph. </p>
      <p>“I can’t believe what is happening in the UK in the name of transgenderism and, worse still, we’re not even allowed to think never mind talk about it,” Mr Miller said earlier this year. </p>
