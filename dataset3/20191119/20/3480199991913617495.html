      <p>A superb stoppage-time free-kick from Javairo Dilrosun saw England’s Under-21s lose to Holland in Doetinchem.</p>
      <p>Mason Greenwood’s first Under-21 goal looked to have earned Aidy Boothroyd’s Young Lions a hard-fought draw before Dilrosun bent in a last-gasp winner to give the hosts a 2-1 victory.</p>
      <p>England went into the game on the back of a Euro 2021 qualifying win in Albania but slipped to defeat in their final game of the year.</p>
      <p>Kaj Sierhuis opened the scoring from close-range at the midway point of the first-half as he tucked home past Bournemouth’s Aaron Ramsdale.</p>
      <p>Dilrosun then tested Ramsdale as Holland enjoyed plenty of the ball with Justin Kluivert causing plenty of problems for the England backline.</p>
      <p>Leicester’s James Justin tested Holland goalkeeper Kjell Scherpen after Rhian Brewster had headed over the crossbar.</p>
      <p>With no breakthrough forthcoming, Boothroyd made four changes just after the hour-mark, introducing Greenwood alongside Dwight McNeil, Reiss Nelson and Reece James.</p>
      <p>But it was Manchester United forward Greenwood who would draw England level, latching onto Phil Foden’s raking pass and bullying Rick Van Drongelen off the ball and finishing coolly.</p>
      <p>Greenwood had another sight of goal late on but the game appeared to be heading for a stalemate until Dilrosun provided a moment of magic.</p>
      <p>With the clock ticking into stoppage time, Ryan Sessegnon was penalised for fouling Ferdi Kadioglu 25 yards out from the England goal.</p>
      <p>Former Manchester City youngster Dilrosun stepped up and curled a perfect free-kick past a helpless Ramsdale to give Holland a dramatic victory at the death.</p>
