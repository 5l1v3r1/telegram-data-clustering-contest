      <p>Officials are seeking the public's help in trying to identify a woman who died 20 years ago in a car crash on the 101 Freeway in the Hollywood area.<br/><br/>The Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner released photos of jewelry that the woman was wearing at the time of the Nov. 17, 1999 crash in hopes of discovering her identify.<br/><br/>She was wearing a twisted, seemingly gold, metal chain with a clear "Hershey Kiss-shaped" pendant, as well as a yellow metal Claddagh ring with a clear heart-shaped stone and a smaller clear round stone above it.<br/><br/>The Jane Doe was driving a maroon-colored 1985 Mitsubishi Galant when it was struck from behind after having stalled on the freeway at Western Avenue, sparking a massive fire. Coroner officials said the woman's body was then deemed unrecognizable.<br/><br/>Authorizes were not able to identify her through the car's license plates because the registered owner had sold the car a few months prior and there was no current information about the car buyer. Additionally, the new owner never updated their information with the Department of Motor Vehicles, according to officials.<br/><br/>Jane Doe is believed to have been between 18 and 35 years old at the time of her death. Her height was estimated at five feet to five-feet six-inches, weighing 146 pounds. Race, hair and eye color were indeterminable.<br/><br/>Anyone with information about the woman is asked to contact the Examiner-Coroner's office at (323 343- 0753 and refer to case number 1999-07845.</p>
