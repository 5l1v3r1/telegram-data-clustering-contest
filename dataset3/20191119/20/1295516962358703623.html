      <h1>Games of Thrones: Clarke Credits Momoa With Helping Her Voice Nudity Concerns</h1>

      <p>Emilia Clarke is making the press rounds for her new movie, <i>Last Christmas</i>, but she can't avoid questions about her <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/game-of-thrones/"><i>Game of Thrones</i></a> past. In a recent interview with Dax Shepard on his popular podcast, Clark credited co-star Jason Momoa for helping her navigate all those awkward nude scenes she had to film in season one, and attributes him for her confidence to deal with uncomfortable situations thereafter.</p>
      <p>Clarke admitted to Shepard on his podcast, <a href="https://armchairexpertpod.com/pods/emilia-clarke"><i>Armchair Expert</i>,</a> that she was quite befuddled in her early days as Daenerys Targaryen. She said, "Season One was what it was," speaking specifically about the "f*ck-ton of nudity" in those early days. However, her co-star Momoa supported her in setting boundaries about what was, and was not, in bounds.</p>

      <p>"It was definitely hard, which is why the scenes when I got to do them with Jason were wonderful," she said. "Because he was like, ‘No, sweetie, this isn’t okay.’ And I was like ‘Oh.’"</p>
      <p>Momoa's advice emboldened her to stand up for herself when it came to nudity in later seasons, and she demanded less skin in later seasons, despite the possibility of not meeting fans' expectations. These days, she characterizes herself as "much more savvy" about what she's willing to show, and she feels much more confident in setting her boundaries for directors and producers.</p>
