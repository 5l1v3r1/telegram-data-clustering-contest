      <p>The 70-year-old has got off to an impressive start in camp, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/im-a-celebritys-nadine-coyle-in-tears-as-shes-comforted-by-caitlyn-jenner-over-skydiving-challenge-11168416/">from that spectacular skydive </a>through to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/im-a-celebrity-caitlyn-jenner-faces-a-snakepit-and-its-not-the-kardashians-in-hardest-bush-tucker-trial-yet-11180627/">tackling other far from pleasant Bushtucker Trials</a> – and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/caitlyn-jenner-opens-up-about-transitioning-after-threatening-to-quit-im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here-on-day-two-11178492/">opening up about transitioning following an emotional first night.</a></p>
      <p>It’s all a far cry from the 70-year-old’s glamorous life back home, but of course Caitlyn’s no stranger to challenges – having previously been an Olympic champion as Bruce before she transitioned.</p>
      <p>So just when did she win at the Olympics and in what sport?</p>
      <p>Here’s what you need to know…</p>
      <h3>Which sport did Caitlyn Jenner compete in at the Olympics and when?</h3>
      <p>Caitlyn first took part in the Summer Olympics in Munich in 1972.</p>

      <p>Pre-transition the former athlete competed in the decathlon, making it into the US team in spite of being a relative newcomer to the sport – and going on to finish 10th in the event in Munich.</p>

      <p>The decathlon saw Jenner undertaking a range of events including 110 metre hurdles, pole vault, javelin, discus, 100 metre sprint and the 1500 metres race.</p>

      <p>Jenner nabbed that coveted gold medal at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal.</p>
      <p>It followed her setting a personal record in the 1500 metres, and setting a world record of 8,618 points for the 10 events that year.</p>
      <p>However it was the only time Jenner won big at the Olympics, retiring from the sport on the same day as getting that gold.</p>

      <p>Speaking to the Hartford Courant, she said: ‘I retired that day. I had to give up too much to get there, life-wise. I knew it was the last hurrah.’</p>
      <p>While it might have been Caitlyn’s only Olympic gold, it wasn’t the only time she ever won a gold medal in athletics – having also grabbed the top prizes at the USA Outdoor Track and Field Championship in 1974, 1975’s Pan American Games in Mexico City and the French Athletics Championships in that same year.</p>
      <p>Impressive stuff.</p>
