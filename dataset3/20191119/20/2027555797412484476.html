      <h1>Kamal, Rajinikanth ready to join hands in politics</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T20:20:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 20:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/etb-sivapriyan" target="_blank">ETB Sivapriyan</a></address>
      <p>Tamil superstar Rajinikanth and his long-time co-star and Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) President Kamal Haasan on Tuesday said they will not hesitate to come together in politics for the “betterment of the state” if such a situation arose.</p>
      <p>The comments by the two actors, who have dominated the tinsel town for four decades, is significant since both profess different ideologies and had earlier decided to chart their own course. Though it would be premature to come to a definite conclusion just by the comments of the two legends, their identical statements are set to dominate the political discourse in Tamil Nadu, which will go to assembly polls in 2021.</p>
      <p>The coming together of the long-time friends in politics, if it happens, would herald a new beginning in Tamil Nadu politics which has only seen the domination of DMK and AIADMK since 1967. Both Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan believe there is space for “credible and strong” leadership in the state after the death of legends M Karunanidhi and J Jayalalithaa.</p>
      <p>While Kamal Haasan’s MNM secured 4 percent votes in the April Lok Sabha elections, Rajinikanth is yet to launch his political party. The superstar, who was identified with the BJP, had on November 8 scotched speculation about his joining the saffron party and had even decried attempts to paint him with “BJP colour.”</p>
      <p>Speaking to reporters at the airport here within a gap of an hour, Kamal Haasan and Rajinikanth said they will “definelty come together” for the welfare of the state if need be.</p>
      <p>“There is no miracle if we come together. We have been together for 44 years. If there be a need (for both of us coming together), I will definitely tell you. This is not the time to discuss these things. Work is important,” Kamal Haasan told reporters at the airport here.</p>
      <p>He was responding to a question on whether Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan would join hands in politics. To another question, Kamal Haasan “we would travel together if the need arises for the betterment and development of Tamil Nadu.”</p>
      <p>Rajinikanth too echoed similar sentiments an hour later. “We (myself and Kamal Haasan) will definitely come together for the development and welfare of Tamil Nadu if such a situation arose.”</p>
      <p>At the event to celebrate 60 years of Kamal Haasan in cinema, Rajinikanth had delivered a subtle yet strong message to Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami who had made light of the actor’s entry into the political scene in 2021 elections.</p>
      <p>“Miracles keep happening in everyone’s life. Even EPS would not have thought he would be Chief Minister. Today he is the Chief Minister. People said his government would not last for two months, but he has been here for two years. Miracles do happen. It happened yesterday, it happens today, and it will continue to happen tomorrow too,” Rajinikanth had said on Sunday.</p>
