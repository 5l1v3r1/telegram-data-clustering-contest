      <p>The opera performance is coming weeks after the father of four released his new album, Jesus is King, to much applause.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <b>Legit.ng</b> earlier reported that the American rapper left prisoners in tears during a <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1276513-kanye-west-moves-prisoners-tears-powerful-worship.html">praise and worship session at Harris County jail in Texas, US</a>.</p>
      <p>It was gathered that Kanye on Sunday, November 17, led about 200 inmates and prison staff in prayers and songs. His worship session was said to have moved a lot of them into tears as he reached out to the innermost part of his soul to deliver a special performance.</p>
      <p>The musician was accompanied by his choir that performed several songs from his recently launched album dubbed Jesus is King. The convicts from the correctional facility were immersed deep in worship.</p>
