      <p>​Cartosat satellites are part of the Indian Remote Sensing Program (IRSP) and are used for Earth's resource management, defence services, and monitoring.</p>
      <p>Besides these <a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201911131077294421-india-calls-for-global-efforts-to-prevent-cyber-attacks-on-critical-facilities-by-terrorists/">three primary satellites</a>, the launcher Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) will carry over two dozen smaller foreign satellites.</p>
      <p>The Cartosat PSLV C-47 rocket, to be launched from Sriharikota at 9.28 a.m. on 25 November, will be placed in an orbit of 509 km at an inclination of 97.5 degrees.</p>
      <p>Two more surveillance satellites — Risat-2BR1 and Risat-2BR2 — will be launched in December with the help of PSLV C-48 and C-49 rockets, reports quoted space agency sources as saying on condition of anonymity.</p>
      <p><a href="https://sputniknews.com/asia/201910241077138465-indian-japanese-space-agencies-to-launch-joint-lunar-mission-study-in-2023/">Cartosat-3 is a third-generation agile advanced satellite</a> having a powerful resolution of 25 cm which enables it to identify two objects separated by a distance of 25 cm. It also has a wider spatial (geographic) range (approximately 16 km), multi-spectral (captures light within specific ranges in the electromagnetic spectrum) and hyperspectral (captures light from across the electromagnetic spectrum) capabilities, which can assist in locating enemy hideouts and terror hubs.</p>
      <p>The Risat-2BR1 and Risat-2BR2 satellites have the capability of seeing through clouds and taking images at night which can be very helpful in tracing border infiltration and terror activity.</p>
