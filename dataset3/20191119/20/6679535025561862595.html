      <p>A 19-year-old college student donated a part of her liver for her father, who was suffering from end-stage liver disease. A team of doctors of a city hospital performed laparoscopic harvesting of the liver for the transplant.</p>
      <p>According to a press release, the patient was suffering from end-stage liver disease and was waiting for transplantation under the deceased donor programme. His daughter volunteered to donate a part of her liver, after his health deteriorated.</p>
      <p>But the family was worried about the incision on the abdomen, long period of recovery, wound-related complications such as pain and hernia, and marriage prospects in the future. GEM Hospital, Coimbatore, has so far performed 22 laparoscopic donor liver harvests from live donors. At its hospital in Chennai, C. Palanivelu, founder of GEM Hospital, and his team of doctors performed the laparoscopic harvesting of liver.</p>
      <p>The right half of the liver was separated in three hours and 30 minutes. Liver resection was done in a bloodless manner, and the surgery was done through five tiny holes that were sealed with a solution, instantaneously facilitating healing without stitches.</p>
      <p>The liver was placed in a bag and removed through a small incision in the lower part of the abdomen, resulting in an invisible scar, the release said.</p>
      <h3>‘Doing well’</h3>
      <p>The recipient team of doctors performed the liver transplant on the patient. The donor was ambulant from day one of the post-operative period and was discharged on the third day. The recipient is doing well after the transplant, the release said.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, the girl, along with Dr. Palanivelu, met Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami. Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar was present.</p>
