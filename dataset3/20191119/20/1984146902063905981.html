      <p>Scarlett Moffatt has slammed claims her 'career is crumbling' in light of reports she won't be a co-host of the forthcoming series of Saturday Night Takeaway.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/scarlett-moffatt">Scarlett</a> , who was recently on screen in much-talked about <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/scarlett-moffatt-defends-new-show-17136842">Channel 4 programme The Tribe Next Door</a> , held the role for two consecutive series of Ant &amp; Dec's award-winning ITV show and described it as her "dream job".</p>
      <p>But on Tuesday a spokesperson for ITV confirmed <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/tv/scarlett-moffatt-saturday-night-takeaway-17278377">she wouldn't be on Takeaway</a> when it returns in early 2020.</p>
      <p>They said: "Scarlett Moffatt won't feature as a contributor in the 2020 series of Saturday Night Takeaway.</p>
      <p>"We thank Scarlett for all of her hard work on the show and will announce details of the new series nearer transmission."</p>
      <p>An ITV source told the Mirror: "Scarlett did a great job on the series and we thank her for all her hard work but sadly the new series doesnâ€™t have room for her on screen role."</p>
      <p>Some reports that suggested that County Durham lass and former Gogglebox star Scarlett's career is on the wane but the 29 year old has hit back with a defiant Instagram video - <i><b>which you can watch above</b> </i>in which she said "The British Tribe next door actually got over 2 million viewers so I'm doing OK thanks huns.</p>

      <p>Scarlett is taking on the role of the Fairy Godmother in Cinderella at Sunderland Empire over the festive period, alongside Boulevard Newcastle's compere Miss Rory and local lad and Superstar finalist Jon Moses.</p>
