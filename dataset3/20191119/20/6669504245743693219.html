      <p>West Kelowna Staff Sgt. Duncan Dixon has been awarded the Order of Merit of the Police Forces.</p>
      <p>Dixon received the award from Governor General Julie Payette at an Oct. 31 ceremony in Rideau Hall in Ottawa, along with 39 other police officers from more than two dozen forces across the country.</p>
      <p>“I take pride in my commitment to serving Canada,” Dixon said in a news release. “Each and every day I strive to make things better for the residents of each of the communities I serve and I thoroughly enjoy the camaraderie I share with my employees of whom I am humbled to serve alongside.”</p>
      <p>Dixon has served with the RCMP for almost 28 years, the last 11 as the officer-in-charge of the West Kelowna detachment.</p>
      <p>“This award recognizes more than just a single action, it’s an accumulation of the outstanding work you have done over the past several decades,” RCMP Commissioner Brenda Lucki said to the inductees.</p>
      <p>“From leading organizational change initiatives to connecting with communities, and building grassroots partnerships, to working on high profile operations and investigations. You have dedicated your careers and many many personal hours to protecting the safety and security of Canadians while improving the lives of those around you.”</p>
