      <p><a href="http://nme.com/artists/soccer-mommy">Soccer Mommy</a> has shared a new single called ‘Yellow Is The Color Of Her Eyes’ along with UK tour dates for 2020.</p>
      <p>The Nashville singer – real name Sophie Allison – returned with the song ‘<a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/soccer-mommy-returns-feisty-new-single-lucy-2549614">Lucy</a>‘ back in September, marking her first material to be released for new label Loma Vista Recordings. It followed on from her debut album ‘<a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/soccer-mommy-clean-album-review">Clean</a>‘, which arrived in March last year.</p>
      <p>This evening (November 19), Soccer Mommy offered up another new track in the form of the seven-minute ‘Yellow Is The Color Of Her Eyes’. The song is accompanied by golden-filtered visuals from director Alex Ross Perry. Watch the video below.</p>

      <p>“’Yellow Is The Color Of Her Eyes’ is a song that is really important to me,” the artist explained in a press release. “The song was inspired by a time when I was on the road constantly and I felt like I was losing time – specifically with my mother.</p>
      <p>“It’s also a song that I feel really showcases my writing when it comes to instrumentation, so it’s one that makes me really proud.”</p>
      <p>Soccer Mommy is set to embark on a UK  headline tour next summer, following on from newly-announced US and European dates in early 2020. The stint will see her take to the stage in Brighton, London, Bristol, Birmingham, Leeds, Glasgow, and Manchester.</p>
