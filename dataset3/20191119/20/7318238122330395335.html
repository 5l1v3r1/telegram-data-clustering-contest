      <p>A Finnish tech company is developing a new kind of plastic that is more environmentally friendly.</p>
      <p>The company, Woodly Oy, has been working on a carbon-neutral plastic substitute that's made out of plant cells from sustainably managed forests.</p>
      <p>While the product works just like regular plastic, it can also be used in the production of different kinds of recyclable packaging.</p>
      <p>“Of course at the beginning, the prices will be a bit higher in comparison to the traditional fossil-based plastic,” CEO Jaakko Kaminn told Euronews.</p>
      <p>“But what's important though is the value that's being created. It's our mission to exhilarate the shift towards a more sustainable future.”</p>
