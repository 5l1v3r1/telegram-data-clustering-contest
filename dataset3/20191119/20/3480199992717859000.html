      <p>This autumn has been a tough one for the UK with many parts seeing record levels of rain and below average temperatures, but with sunshine showing up in the unlikeliest of places.</p>
      <p>Here we take a look at November’s weird weather so far – based on Met Office data up to November 17.</p>
      <p>
        <b>– Rain</b>
      </p>
      <p>Nottinghamshire has seen the most rain compared with the average – with 189% of its monthly average falling already.</p>
      <p>A further 20 counties including Aberdeenshire, Buckinghamshire and Herefordshire have had more than their average.</p>

      <p>The Shetland Islands have been much drier than usual – with just 17% of the average November rain to date.</p>
      <p>

        <b>– Sun</b>
      </p>
      <p>Lerwick has surpassed its usual amount of sunshine for the time of year, with 44.8 hours, compared with a monthly average of 33.8.</p>
      <p>The town’s sunshine levels are made even more surprising by the fact it sees an hour less daylight than the South East of England.</p>
