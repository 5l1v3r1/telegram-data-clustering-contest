      <h1>REPORT: Colin Kaepernick Considering 2nd Workout At NFL Owners Meetings</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T20:49:24+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 20:49</time> by <a rel="author">Darrelle Lincoln</a></address>
      <p>What was supposed to be 25 or so teams present when Colin Kaepernick took the field for his workout ended up being only seven or eight teams due to Kaepernick bailing out on the original venue to change it to a local high school an hour away.</p>
      <p>It seems the free agent quarterback may have plans to throw in front of more teams after the 2019 season concludes.</p>
      <p>Kaepernick’s agent, Jeff Nalley, has sent the footage from Saturday’s workout to all 32 NFL teams, but Nalley also stated he is not optimistic his client will be signed in the near future.</p>
      <p>According to ESPN’s Howard Bryant, Nalley also said Kaepernick is considering holding a second workout near the NFL owners meetings, which will take place in Palm Beach in March.</p>

      <p>Following Saturday’s debacle, it is highly unlikely that Kaepernick’s team and the NFL would work together again to set up another workout after the first one fell apart over a liability waiver and media access.</p>
