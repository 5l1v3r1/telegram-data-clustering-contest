        <b>There was heartbreak for Helen (Verity Marshall), Lofty (Lee Mead) and Dominic (David Ames) in tonight’s Holby City. Helen arrived at the hospital with a proposition for Lofty. She wanted them to live together ‘like a real couple’ and bring up the baby together. ‘Dom is not part of the equation,’ she insisted, adding that she was in love with Lofty – but of course we’d guessed that.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Dominic has been mainly very sensible, calm and mature about Lofty’s impending fatherhood and his attitude was that Lofty needed to sort out for himself what he really wanted. Lofty told Helen he definitely wanted Dominic in the baby’s life and very beautifully said the baby would get ‘three doses of unconditional love instead of two.’ Events overtook them, though, when Helen said she hadn’t felt the baby move for over a day.</p>

      <p>Lofty brought Helen into AAU where she was examined by Serena (Catherine Russell) and the glorious Fleur Fanshawe (Debbie Chazen) – who made the sad announcement that the baby had died. In very emotional scenes Helen had to deliver her baby, with Lofty by her side. Dom was consoled by Ange (Dawn Steele), who understood that he felt the loss of the little boy too.</p>
      <p>Dominic also talked to Donna (Jaye Jacobs) who told him about her own little baby boy who was miscarried at 22 weeks. ‘He looked at me and I looked at him and in that second we knew we had each other,’ she said in a touching scene that brought tears to my eyes. ‘I was just looking forward to meeting our little boy,’ Dominic said, sadly.</p>
      <p>Jac (Rosie Marcel), meanwhile, was facing a mortality and morbidity review about the operation on Sandra last week. Elliot (Paul Bradley) tried to rally support for her with Kian (Ramin Karimloo), and he also asked Fletch (Alex Walkinshaw). Fletch said he would support Jac if Elliot could say ‘hand on heart’ that Jac was her usual self, but of course she isn’t. ‘She’s hanging on by her fingernails and she’s the only one who can’t see it,’ was Fletch’s assessment.</p>

      <p>Jac has some good friends at Holby and none better than Sacha (Bob Barrett), who gave her a reassuring pep talk before the meeting. ‘If you need a friendly face – look my way,’ he told her. Despite all this support it was a tough meeting and Max McGerry (Jo Martin) went in hard on Jac. Afterwards Nicky (Belinda Owusu) told Elliot that most of what Jac had said were her own recollections during the meeting were actually taken verbatim from Nicky’s notes which she’d left lying around.</p>

      <p>Jac denied this and also denied to Elliot that she was stressed. ‘You think I’m stressed?’ she said, sounding stressed. ‘Stress is working every day until you give birth. It’s finding a babysitter at 10 o’clock at night when an emergency comes in. It’s being a mother and a father and having nothing left for yourself. This isn’t stress.’ But Elliot had noticed that Jac had been shaking during the meeting.</p>

      <p>Elliot has been hiding his heart problem from Jac, not wanting to add to her problems, but she’d noticed that he and Kian keep having furtive little discussions. Elliot finally told her what his problem was and she said – as he knew she would – that she was the best person to fix it. It’s a very high-risk procedure and Elliot doesn’t want it to be on Jac’s head if something goes wrong – but she wants to prove herself by fixing him.</p>
      <p>If she does, it’ll be under even more pressure than usual because Max has placed Darwin under special review. Max also had time for a spot of brain surgery, when Kian’s girlfriend Bea (Rosalind Halstead) returned to Darwin with a nasty infection that spread to her brain. ‘I’m a bit good at this, you know,’ Max told him.</p>

      <p>Xavier (Marcus Griffiths) fell over a bucket and hurt his ankle, but this wasn’t his main worry of the day. Operating on a young woman who’d become ill after having liposuction, he realised she was one of Donna’s Botox patients. Though the Botox he’d been prescribing for Donna to give her hadn’t been anything to do with her ending up in hospital, the ethics of pushing cosmetic procedures to people who really didn’t need them began to bother him.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>Donna thought he was mainly worried about how it would look to Max and said she couldn’t afford to stop doing the Botox because it was vital income for her family. Zav reassured her that the reason he wants his career to go well is for her and the girls – and to prove his point he even turned down a drink at Albie’s with the new CEO to go out with Donna. The fact that his ankle had totally seized up by then may also have had something to do with it.</p>
