      <p>Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said on Tuesday he promised the alleged middleman in Daphne Caruana Galizia's murder a pardon if he identifies the mastermind of the journalist's assassination.</p>
      <p>Muscat made the surprise offer after authorities last week arrested someone who claimed to know who ordered the deadly 2017 car bombing of the renowned blogger and journalist.</p>

      <p>The pardon would cover any criminal cases the suspect may face but he must assist the authorities and his evidence must be corroborated in court, Muscat said.</p>
      <p>Maltese police and Interpol, which has been helping with the high-profile case, last week arrested several people as part of an anti-money laundering operation, including someone suspected of involvement in Caruana Galizia's murder.</p>
      <p>Caruana Galizia, described by supporters as a "one-woman WikiLeaks", had highlighted <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/issues/corruption.html">corruption</a> in Malta, including among politicians.</p>
      <p>"The targeted person, following interrogation, expressed the intention to collaborate with the authorities and through his lawyers requested that first a presidential pardon be given on all the cases he might have had," Muscat told journalists.</p>
      <p>"I have discussed the issue with the authorities including the attorney general and we agreed that no blanket pardon should be given without any certainty regarding the information to be submitted.</p>
      <p>"I have signed a letter ... that states that when the person testifies in court and the information is confirmed and corroborated, I would be recommending that this person is granted a presidential pardon," Muscat said.</p>
      <p>The prime minister and his family were among those accused by Caruana Galizia's investigations and her blog, which often launched highly personal attacks.</p>
      <p>Three men are facing trial for allegedly carrying out the killing, but the mastermind has not been identified. <br/>In September, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/malta.html">Malta</a> made a surprise u-turn and appointed a retired judge to head a public inquiry into the journalist's 2017 killing.</p>
