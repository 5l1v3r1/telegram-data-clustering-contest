      <p>The outcome of Britain’s December election poses a binary choice for sterling and “anything can happen” according to the largest UK bank.</p>
      <p>A result paving the way to a Brexit deal with the EU could send the pound up about 12% to $1.45 by the end of next year, said David Bloom, global head of foreign- exchange strategy at HSBC Holdings.</p>
      <p>Or a no-deal Brexit could see it tumble some 15% to $1.10.</p>
      <p>“Nothing is priced in,” Mr Bloom said. “The political outcome will determine the future of the currency.”</p>
      <p>His comments contrast with traders’ confidence in sterling, fuelled by polls suggesting the Conservatives will defeat the Labour Party on December 12 and secure a Brexit deal that could help end the political paralysis.</p>
      <p>The pound is hovering near a six-month high against the euro, while traders are confident prime minister Boris Johnson will maintain his lead, a gauge of expected large moves in the currency suggests.</p>
      <p>Any resolution is good, Mr Bloom said, either it be another referendum or a Brexit deal. Political wrangling will start to ebb away, the economy could get a fiscal boost, and the Bank of England could start considering rate increases. The reverse could see recession fears flare.</p>
