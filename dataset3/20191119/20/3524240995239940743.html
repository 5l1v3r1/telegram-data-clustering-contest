      <p>Daud Olatunji, Abeokuta</p>
      <p>Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has said he would not act like a coward for fear of death, saying, he would continue to raise the alarm when things are not right in the country.</p>
      <p>Obasanjo said this at the two- day interactive session of the Presidential Youth Mentorship Retreat held at the Youth Development Centre, Olusegun Obasanjo Presidential Library, Abeokuta.</p>
      <p>The former president stated that his major concern was to build leaders who would lead Africa to her promised land.</p>
      <p>He said God has favoured him to live long after serving as military head of state and as democratically-elected president of the country.</p>
      <p>The former president explained that the purpose of the Presidential Mentorship Retreat was to facilitate the release of creative energies of young people.</p>
      <p>He noted that the youths across the African  region need interaction with their leaders.</p>
      <p>He, however, advised the youths to sacrifice themselves individually and collectively to make the African continent a  great nation.</p>
      <p>While fielding questions from the participants at the retreat, Obasanjo said ” I ‘m not afraid of death at my age, God has favoured me and I appreciate God’s blessings on me over these years.</p>
      <p>” My concern over the years is to build leaders of Africa. My greatest concern is tomorrow and that tomorrow begins today.</p>
      <p>“The world today is in crisis, I believed that youths need interaction from leaders and learning from them. I want to be inspired at the end of this programme.</p>
      <p>“I want you to identify yourself and use your identity to achieve service to God and humanity.</p>
      <p>“I want you all to come out individually and collectively in making Nigeria and Africa at large a great nation .”</p>
