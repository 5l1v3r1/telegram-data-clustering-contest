      <p>More padlocked firefighter inlets were found at another People’s Action Party (PAP) ward, weeks after the authorities managing the Bukit Batok estate came under fire over padlocked fire hose reels at the ward.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) firefighters who were trying to put out a raging blaze at a 13th-storey unit at Block 210A Bukit Batok Street 21 found that the fire hose reel cabinets at the block were padlocked.</p>
      <p>They also found there was no water supply for the hose reel when they broke one padlock.</p>
      <p>It is said the problems with the fire hose reel delayed the rescue attempt and the SCDF subsequently revealed it issued Fire Hazard Abatement Notices to Jurong-Clementi Town Council (JCTC) over these two issues.</p>

      <p>JCTC and Bukit Batok MP Murali Pillai later explained measure to padlock the fire hose reels were taken to prevent misuse and vandalism.</p>
      <p>Apologising for the incident, Mr Pillai revealed that two town council staff who had padlocked the hose reel will face disciplinary action brought on by the town council management.</p>
      <p>The administrators of Facebook page Malu.SG published photos showing padlocked firefighter inlets at Tampines GRC.</p>
      <p>Tampines Town Council is run by Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat, Minister for Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli as well as MPs Baey Yam Keng, Desmond Choo and Cheng Li Hui.</p>
      <p>The photos show the padlocked inlets are from blocks 937 and 146 at Tampines and there are padlocks on inlets at other blocks.</p>
      <p>Following the revelation, the administrators of Malu.SG asked whether there should be a lock to these inlets.</p>
      <p>The page administrators, however, said people should not single the two town council members at Bukit Batok out if padlocking the inlets is the norm since other wards are doing the same.</p>
      <p>However, the page said others must also be held accountable and disciplined if there should not be padlocks on the equipment.</p>
      <p>The administrators of the Facebook page said: <i><b>“We aren’t firefighters. So we are just wondering, not assuming. By right, either no one gets reprimanded – or more people ought to be, since there are locks in other parts of Singapore.</b></i></p>
      <p>
        <i>
          <b>“In addition, we don’t want to politicise this observation. It’s more about just being fair and consistent is all.”</b>
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>The Independent has contacted Tampines Town Council for clarification and will update this story once we receive comment.</p>
