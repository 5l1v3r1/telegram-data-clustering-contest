      <p>Narrating the experience of his father’s time in jail and his prosecution, former Delhi University professor S.A.R Geelani’s son, Atif delivered an emotional address at a remembrance meeting for him held at Arts Faculty on Tuesday. Former colleagues, friends and students also shared stories of the late professor, who was acquitted of his involvement in the 2001 Parliament attack case.</p>
      <p>“Our family was never left alone. We were never allowed to live a life we always wanted,” Atif told those gathered.</p>
      <p>He spoke of seeing his father beaten up and chained by the special cell when he was a child, of the trauma when his father was shot at after he was released from Tihar in 2004 and how the memories of his imprisonment returned when he was again imprisoned in 2016. Others present, including former students and colleagues, also spoke of how the professor was labelled a “terrorist” at Zakir Husain College, where he taught, even after his acquittal and how those who spoke in his support were silenced.</p>
      <p>“I can proudly say baba devoted all his life to the cause of the people...and I am proud to say I am his son” said Atif, who along with his sister decided to pursue career as lawyers. “We had in our hearts that we will make sure that nobody goes through all of this again and do anything we could to protect the people” he said.</p>
      <p>“He was such a figure to me that I still cant believe he is not with us. I resume my day-to-day work with the thought that he will always be with me. Always.” said Atif.</p>
      <p>The meeting was called by various students groups, including AISA, Pinjra Tod collective, SFI, DSU as well as a group of students from Zakir Husain College, who also spoke against the ongoing communication blackout in Kashmir.</p>
