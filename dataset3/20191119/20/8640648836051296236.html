      <h1>Las Vegas restaurant owner’s cause of death a mystery</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T20:41:45+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 20:41</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/staff/rio-lacanlale/" target="_blank">Rio Lacanlale</a></address>
      <p>The Clark County coroner’s office could not determine how or why Sharon Harrell, the 53-year-old owner of TC’s World Famous Rib Crib in Las Vegas, died in late August.</p>
      <p>Both her cause and manner of death were officially ruled “undetermined” on Tuesday by the coroner’s office.</p>
      <p>A manner of death is ruled one of five ways at the coroner’s office: natural, homicide, suicide, accident or undetermined. <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/local-las-vegas/no-answers-behind-how-why-of-36-clark-county-deaths-last-year-1572128/">A case becomes undetermined</a> if investigators are unable to medically explain the cause of death or if the case has conflicting manners of death, the coroner’s office has previously told the Las Vegas Review-Journal.</p>
      <p>The ruling on Harrell’s death comes <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/crime/body-found-near-chinatown-confirmed-as-restaurant-owners-1836797/">nearly three months after she was found </a><a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/crime/body-found-near-chinatown-confirmed-as-restaurant-owners-1836797/">dead</a> on Aug. 28 inside her car in the Chinatown area, about 2 miles south of her restaurant.</p>
      <p>By then, Las Vegas police have said, Harrell had been missing for at least five days. She was last seen alive near Durango Drive and Oakey Boulevard.</p>
      <p>The Metropolitan Police Department has released few details surrounding Harrell’s disappearance and death but previously confirmed that its homicide section was investigating.</p>
      <p>Metro spokeswoman Alejandra Zambrano said Tuesday the investigation was active and ongoing. No arrests have been made in the case, she said.</p>
      <p>The woman’s goddaughter, Alexis Germany, has said she was told that investigators suspected foul play. Germany could not immediately be reached for comment on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>For 15 years, Harrell owned TC’s World Famous Rib Crib, a barbecue restaurant near Durango and Spring Mountain Road that Harrell named after her late father. As of Tuesday, the restaurant was listed as permanently closed on Google and Yelp.</p>
