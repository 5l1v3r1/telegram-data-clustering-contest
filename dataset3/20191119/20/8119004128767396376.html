        <b>A cabin crew member of Biman Bangladesh Airlines has alleged sexual abuse by a pilot in the cockpit.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The flag carrier was investigating the accused pilot, Captain Ishrat Ahmed, after receiving complaints from the flight attendant via email, Biman Deputy General Manager Zakir Hossain told bdnews24.com on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Ishrat has been sexually harassing her for six years, according to the email sent to the Flight Services Department of Biman.</p>
      <p>For the last time, according to the complaint, Ishrat tried to touch her in the cockpit of a Dhaka-Chattogram-Abu Dhabi flight on Oct 26 when the co-pilot left.</p>
      <p>“He (Ishrat) tried to show me nude photos of women on his tablet. I told him that I didn’t have any interest in these things,” the woman wrote in the complaint.</p>
      <p>Captain Ishrat also offered her to spend time with him in a hotel at the time, she alleged.</p>
      <p>The cabin crew member also said she was forced to file a complaint after six years of abuse as Ishrat threatened to put her in danger if she did not agree to his proposal.</p>
      <p>Captain Ishrat was unreachable on his mobile phone for comment.</p>
