      <p>Right now, <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">Rakuten</a> has the PlayStation 4 Pro lower than it is advertised to be on Black Friday. So, now is a really great time to pick one up.</p>
      <p>It's currently listed at just $294. Now to get this price, you are going to need to login (or sign up) to your Rakuten account. It's a free account and you even get cash back! Then you'll be able to get it for just $294, when you enter the promo code <b>ANT59C </b>at checkout.</p>
      <p>The PS4 Pro is a really great console to pick up. It's not quite as powerful as the Xbox One X, but it is pretty close. You're going to be able to play games in 4K HDR, as well as streaming content in 4K HDR. So if you are a cord cutter, this is definitely going to come in handy.</p>

      <p>With PS4 Pro, there are a ton of great games available out there. Like Rocket League, Fortnite, The Last Of Us Part III and much more. Now unfortunately, this PS4 Pro does not come with a game included, but you are getting an extra controller here. So if you want to play some multiplayer games, you can do just that with the PS4 Pro now. Which is really fun.</p>
      <p>This is going to make a really great console for someone that's looking to get a new one. Anyone that unwraps a PS4 Pro under the Christmas tree next month is going to be so ecstatic about it, and it'll be the best gift they receive.</p>
      <p>You can pick up the PlayStation 4 Pro from Rakuten <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=6kPwAD1/gQA&amp;mid=36342&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rakuten.com%2Fshop%2Fantonline%2Fproduct%2F1383137%2F">by clicking here.</a> Make sure that you do login or create a free Rakuten account and then use the promo code <b>ANT59C</b>at checkout. But you'd better hurry as this price won't last long. And you won't find a cheaper price on the PlayStation 4 Pro on Black Friday.</p>
