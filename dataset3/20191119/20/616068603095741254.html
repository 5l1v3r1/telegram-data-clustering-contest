      <p>Three hot topics, one evening, coming up at the Penticton Trade and Convention Centre. </p>
      <p>Penticton residents will get the chance to discuss plans for the lake-to-lake cycling route, Skaha Lake Park East plan and the 2020-254 business and financial plans. </p>
      <p>"It is a busy time of year so bundling these opportunities is a good use of citizens’ time and City resources,” said engagement strategist JoAnne Kleb.</p>
      <p>“If these topics interest you, mark the dates in your calendar and watch for more information about each of the topics to be released in the days leading up to the open houses.”</p>
      <p>This is the second multi-topic open house hosted by the City. The first 'juicy topics' open house was held in 2018 and was attended by approximately 180 citizens.</p>
      <p>Find more information about the topics that will be discussed <a href="https://www.penticton.ca/EN/meta/city-news/news-archives/2019-archives/discuss-three-hot-topics-in-one-evening.html">here</a>. </p>
