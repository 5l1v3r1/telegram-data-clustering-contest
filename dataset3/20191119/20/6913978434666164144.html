      <p><b>SAN FRANCISCO — </b>Google sets out to transform the video game world with its Stadia service crafted to let people access console-quality games as easily as they do email.<br/><br/>With the Stadia launch on Tuesday, the internet giant is aiming for a piece of a global video game industry expected to top $150 billion this year by using its cloud computing technology offering rich features without the need for consoles.<br/><br/>Stadia announced 10 more games on Monday to bring its lineup to 22 with more promised by year's end.<br/><br/>Google last month sold out of "Founder's Edition" kits, which are priced at $129. Some who ordered Stadia kits were grumbling online that they had yet to receive the hardware they need to use the service.<br/><br/>Each kit contains a Stadia controller and a pendant-shaped Chromecast Ultra wireless connection device that plugs into television sets.<br/><br/>Stadia games are also playable using Google Chrome web browser software on computers as well as with Google-made Pixel smartphones from the second-generation onward.<br/><br/>Stadia Pro subscriptions, priced at $10 a month in the US, will be available in 14 countries in North America and Europe.<br/><br/>Subscribers will be able to buy games that will be hosted at Google data centers, but some free games will be available to them, starting with "Destiny 2: The Collection."<br/><br/>Stadia on smartphones at the start will work with WiFi connections rather than rely on mobile telecom services.<br/><br/>Being able to play without lags or interruptions is paramount to gamers, and flawed internet connections could cause frustration. Internet speed will also determine how rich in-game graphics can be.<br/><br/>Some promised features such as integration with YouTube will not be in place at launch.<br/><br/>Google appeared to be committed to making Stadia a success, according to Ubisoft senior vice president of partnerships Chris Early.<br/><br/>The French video game giant has been working with Google and its games are among titles coming to the service.<br/><br/>"From what I have seen, their plans are too deep; they are too good, and they are too invested," Early said. "They are not calling it quits any time soon."<br/><br/>He expects a long launch period during which Google will beef up Stadia.<br/><br/>"If there is a one-day problem at launch, it isn't the end of the world," he said, stressing the potential for Stadia to let people play without investing in consoles.<br/><br/>Stadia aims to lead the way to hosting titles in data centers, letting people use whatever gadgets they wish to access console-quality play.<br/><br/>US technology veteran Microsoft has been testing a Project xCloud online game platform that it plans to make available on Windows-powered personal computers next year.<br/><br/>Sony Interactive Entertainment has a PlayStation Now service that combines cloud gaming and title downloads that is synched to its latest-generation consoles and Windows-powered personal computers.<br/><br/>Having titles sit on powerful servers in the cloud could allow for unprecedented features such as thousands of people playing simultaneously or environments as detailed as the real world.<br/><br/>The Google move comes following the launch of the Apple Arcade mobile game service, which offers custom game apps downloaded to devices. A rival Google Play Pass charges the same $4.99 monthly subscription price as that of Arcade, which focuses on games for Apple iOS devices — AFP</p>
