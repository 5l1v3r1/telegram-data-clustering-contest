      <h1>Jose Mourinho to Tottenham a ‘very strong possibility’, source tells Sport Witness</h1>

      <p>Within minutes of Tottenham Hotspur announcing they’d parted ways with Mauricio Pochettino, and with the Spurs website still creaking under the pressure of a million visits, Jose Mourinho was already being linked with the vacancy.</p>
      <p>It makes sense, Mourinho is without a job, has a house in London, will be eager to get back into work and would be in control of a club where he could climb the table relatively easily.</p>
      <p>Tottenham’s historic reluctance to spend at the levels the former Manchester United manager would require would be a negative, and something many would immediately question.</p>
      <p>Sport Witness contacted a well placed source, and in these situations it’s not so often a frank reply is received.</p>
      <p>This time it was different and quick, with the word coming back being Mourinho to Tottenham is a ‘very strong possibility’.</p>
      <p>When further pressed on whether a deal could be concluded soon, the response was more cagey.</p>
      <p>As regular readers will be aware, without this being from a good and proven source, this claim wouldn’t be appearing direct from Sport Witness.</p>
