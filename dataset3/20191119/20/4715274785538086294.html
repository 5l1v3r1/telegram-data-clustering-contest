      <h1>Stocks climb on bargain-hunting</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T20:20:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 20:20</time> by <a rel="author">Manila Standard Business</a></address>
      <p>The stock market rose Tuesday on bargain-hunting following another record close on Wall Street overnight.</p>
      <p>The Philippine Stock Exchange Index gained 31.20 points, or 0.4 percent, to 7,912.14 on a value turnover of P6.2 billion. Losers, however, beat gainers, 100 to 88, with 50 issues unchanged.</p>
      <p>LT Group Inc., the holding company of tycoon Lucio Tan, advanced 6.7 percent to P12.42, while Bank of the Philippine Islands, the third-biggest lender in terms of assets, climbed 1.6 percent to P94.</p>
      <p>BDO Unibank Inc., the largest bank, rose 1.6 percent to P157.40, while DMCI Holdings Inc. of the Consunji Group added 1.5 percent to P7.62.</p>
      <p>The rest of Asian markets mostly rose Tuesday as investors bet on China and the US reaching a mini trade deal despite a report saying Beijing was concerned about the chances of an agreement.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong extended Monday’s rally with another surge but continuing protests in parts of the city—particularly a violent standoff at a university—remained a source of worry.</p>
      <p>Regional traders were given another strong lead from Wall Street, where all three main indexes ended at new records on hopes for a good holiday shopping season with the key Black Friday sales day coming next week.</p>
      <p>World equities have broadly been on the rise in recent weeks on optimism that the world’s top two economies will eventually hammer out a mini trade deal as part of a wider agreement.</p>
      <p>However, there have been bumps in the road and the latest came Monday when CNBC reported that China was pessimistic about the chances of a pact because Donald Trump is not in favor of rolling back tariffs.</p>
      <p>Trump last week denied claims by Beijing that the two sides had put in place a plan to remove levies as the talks' progress.</p>
      <p>The report again highlighted the fragile nature of the negotiations.</p>
      <p>“Investors have little option but to keep pace with the rapid shifts on the US-China phase-one deal, attempting to make sense of the many comments—official and from press ‘sources’—on whether a rollback was now genuinely on the table,” said Stephen Innes at AxiTrader. “Ultimately they remain hostage to these developments.”  </p>
      <p>However, he said the broad gains on Tuesday meant “it looks like (investors) are starting to take trade headlines with a barrel of salt.”  </p>
      <p>In early trade, regional markets swung in and out of positive territory.</p>
      <p>Shanghai jumped 0.9 percent, Sydney piled on 0.7 percent and Taipei rallied 0.5 percent, while Wellington was up 0.2 percent. Jakarta and Mumbai also enjoyed gains.</p>
      <p>But Tokyo ended 0.5 percent lower, Singapore lost 0.6 percent and Seoul shed 0.3 percent, while Bangkok was slightly lower.</p>
      <p>National Australia Bank’s Rodrigo Catril said he was still betting on an agreement being reached.</p>
      <p>“The negotiations remain ongoing (and) a phase-one deal looks more likely than not, but as usual the devil will be in the detail,” he said in a commentary. “The more tariff rollbacks we get, the better for market sentiment and global growth outlook.”</p>
      <p>A decision by Washington to delay by another 90 days a ban of US firms from doing business with China’s Huawei provided support. <b>With AFP</b></p>
