      <h1>More QC biz centers to open in malls soon</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T20:50:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 20:50</time> by <a rel="author">Rio N. Araja</a></address>
      <p>The Quezon City government will open four more business centers in the next two weeks, Mayor Joy Belmonte has announced.</p>
      <p>“We will continue working to make life easier for our constituents by putting up additional Business Centers in different malls so they can easily access the services provided by the city government,” Belmonte said Tuesday.</p>
      <p>“Quezon City residents can expect more of these Business Centers in malls near their area because this is part of our promise to bring the City Hall closer to the people,” she added.</p>
      <p>She inaugurated the first two business centers at Robinsons Mall in Novaliches and at Ali Mall in Cubao where residents could transact starting Monday.</p>
      <p>Edgar Villanueva, city treasurer, said the business center provides services such as current assessment and collection of payment of real-property taxes.</p>
      <p>The center is also authorized to collect business taxes and payments for individual and corporate community taxes and other fees.</p>
      <p>“With business centers now more accessible, we expect residents and businesses to pay their taxes and other fees on time,” Villanueva said.</p>
      <p>Ma. Margarita Roa-Santos, Business Permits and Licensing Department chief, said the business center at Ali Mall, which is close to a Department of Trade Negosyo Center, can also help fast-track the processing of business and occupational permits.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Belmonte entered into an agreement with Robinsons Land Corp., one of the largest mall operators in the country, for the establishment of a business center in three of its malls in Quezon City.</p>
      <p>Under the arrangement, the city government will be allowed to establish business centers in three Robinsons malls—Galleria, Magnolia, and Novaliches.</p>
      <p>The city mayor is also currently in talks with Mallers Management Corp. and Ayala Corp. for the establishment of business centers inside the Fisher Mall and Fairview Terraces, respectively. </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Mayor Belmonte has piloted “Fresh Market” designed to help farmers in the countryside boost their income while providing city residents with access to affordable agriculture produce.</p>
      <p>The city government has opened the Quezon Memorial Circle to its farmer-to-consumer program and Kaya Natin Movement as a venue for farmers from nearby provinces to sell their harvest, such as rice, vegetables and fruits, directly to the customers.</p>
      <p>“We are assured that the products being sold here are affordable because they don’t go through any middleman or traders who would impose additional cost,” Belmonte said.</p>
      <p>“Also, farmers are being assisted by their respective local government units in bringing their goods to Quezon City, so no transportation cost will be passed on to consumers,” she added.</p>
      <p>The initiative will be held from 6 a.m. onwards on Saturdays and 6 a.m. to 12 noon on Sundays.</p>
      <p>Belmonte said partner-farmers from Cavite, Bataan, Quezon, Camarines Norte and Nueva Ecija have availed the opportunity to sell their products directly to consumer.</p>
      <p>“We expect the list of provinces to grow as we continue to reach out to farmers from nearby provinces to grab the chance to earn additional income,” she noted.</p>
      <p>The “Fresh Market” is one of Belmonte’s commitments to healthy food and food security when she attended the World Mayors Climate Change Summit in Copenhagen, Denmark.</p>
