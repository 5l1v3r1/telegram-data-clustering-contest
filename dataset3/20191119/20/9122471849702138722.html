      <h1>Colin Cowherd Unveils His College Football Playoff Top 6</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T20:51:08+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 20:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/andrewmccarty" target="_blank">Andrew McCarty</a></address>
      <p>In just a few hours, the newest College Football Playoff rankings will be released following a big weekend of action.</p>
      <p>Before the poll comes out, FOX Sports host Colin Cowherd broke down what he thinks the top six should be. With the injury to star quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, Cowherd doesn’t think Alabama deserves to be in the top six.</p>
      <p>After another dominant performance last weekend – albeit against Rutgers – Ohio State sits in the top spot.</p>
      <p>Here’s Cowherd’s top six:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Ohio State</li>
        <li>Clemson</li>
        <li>LSU</li>
        <li>Georgia</li>
        <li>Oregon</li>
        <li>Utah</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Cowherd breaks down his choices below.</p>

      <p>Despite taking down Alabama two weeks ago, LSU doesn’t come in at No. 1 for Cowherd. Issues on the defense might be too much to overlook for the committee as well.</p>
      <p>Several analysts, including ESPN’s Paul Finebaum think Ohio State will take over as the No. 1 team if the Buckeyes take down Penn State this weekend. Ohio State is nearly a 20-point favorite over the Nittany Lions playing in front of its home fans.</p>
      <p>Recent memory suggests the game will be close, but Ohio State looks like a juggernaut so far this season.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, no one is talking about a Clemson program that won the national title last season and sits undefeated on the season.</p>
