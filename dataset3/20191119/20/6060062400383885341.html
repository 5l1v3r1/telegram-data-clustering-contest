        <li>President <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-donald-trump-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-4">Donald Trump</a> and Republicans in Congress have made a big fuss over Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman wearing his military uniform on Capitol Hill during the impeachment inquiry.</li>
        <li>But Vindman is an active duty Army officer and is following regulations by wearing his uniform to impeachment hearings.</li>
        <li>Trump and his GOP allies have zeroed in on the uniform to suggest Vindman is being performative, which he vehemently denies.</li>
        <li>"The uniform I wear today is that of the United States Army," Vindman, an Iraq War combat veteran, said on Tuesday. "We do not serve any political party. We serve the nation."</li>

      <p>President <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/who-is-donald-trump-bio-age-family-key-positions-2019-4">Donald Trump</a> and his Republican allies in Congress have zeroed in on Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman wearing his military uniform to impeachment hearings amid his participation in the inquiry.</p>
      <p>The implication from the president and congressional Republicans is seemingly that Vindman, an Iraq War combat veteran and active duty Army officer, has used his dress uniform as a prop as part of a partisan performance.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.army.mil/e2/c/downloads/337951.pdf">Army regulations state that</a> "when an invitation calls for business attire, the appropriate Army uniform is the service or dress uniform." The regulations further state: "All personnel will wear an Army uniform when on duty, unless granted an exception by the commander to wear civilian clothes. "</p>
      <p>In short, Vindman has been following US military protocol, and it would be a violation of Army regulations for him to show up to congressional hearings out of uniform.</p>
      <p>And Vindman — the top adviser on Ukraine on the National Security Council — in his testimony on Tuesday vehemently denied his involvement in the inquiry was motivated by partisan leanings. </p>
      <p>"The uniform I wear today is that of the United States Army," Vindman said. "We do not serve any political party. We serve the nation."</p>
      <p>GOP members of the House Intelligence Committee zeroed in on Vindman's uniform in Tuesday's hearing. </p>
      <p>Rep. Chris Stewart of Utah, for example, mentioned that Vindman wore the uniform "even though you wear a suit" to the White House. He also questioned why Vindman earlier in the hearing corrected Rep. Devin Nunes, the ranking member on the committee, on his current rank in the Army.</p>
      <p>Stewart said: "Do you always insist on civilians calling you by your rank?"</p>
      <p>"I am in uniform wearing my military rank, I just thought it was appropriate to stick with that," Vindman replied.</p>
      <p>He added: "The attacks I've had in the press and Twitter have kind of eliminated the fact that...or marginalized me as a military officer."</p>

      <h3>Trump on Vindman: 'I understand now he wears his uniform when he goes in'</h3>
      <p>Meanwhile, Trump at the White House on Tuesday explicitly mentioned Vindman's attire in comments to reporters.</p>
      <p>The president said: "I don't know him, I don't know, I don't know – as he says, Lieutenant Colonel. I understand somebody had the misfortune of calling him mister and he corrected him. I never saw the man, I understand now he wears his uniform when he goes in, no, I don't know Vindman at all."</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Trump also mocked Vindman for wearing his uniform in an interview last week, <a href="https://twitter.com/ddale8/status/1196842927164678144?s=20">stating</a>: "You know him. He shows up in his uniform for the first time ever."</p>
      <p>The remarks from Stewart and Trump echoed the headline of <a href="https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/10/29/nsc-official-alex-vindman-testifies-in-full-military-uniform-despite-not-wearing-one-to-work-every-day/">an article</a> from the far-right news outlet Breitbart. The article, published in late October, is titled: "NSC Official Alex Vindman Testifies in Full Military Uniform, Despite Not Wearing One to Work Every Day."</p>
      <p>Democratic Rep. Sean Maloney on Tuesday rebuked Republicans for focusing on Vindman's uniform. </p>
      <p>"It seems like if anybody gets to wear that uniform it's somebody with a breast plate with those commendations," Maloney said in defense of Vindman.</p>
      <p>Vindman was on the July 25 call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that led to a whistleblower complaint that ultimately sparked the impeachment inquiry. The Army officer's first-hand knowledge of the call and expertise on Ukraine have made him a key figure in the scandal that's threatening to upend Trump's presidency.</p>
