      <p>Presenting the revised budget estimates for the current financial year on Tuesday, Commissioner of the East Delhi Municipal Corporation, Dilraj Kaur proposed a hike in property tax in various categories, a betterment tax as well as a professional tax — similar to proposals made in the South and North bodies.</p>
      <p>Among new taxes, the east body proposed the introduction of an education cess of 5% of property tax, introduction of a “betterment tax” (levied on improvement of property value as a consequence of improved public infrastructure) at a rate of 10% of the property tax and introduction of a professional tax with two slabs. For people earning more than ₹5 lakh a year, a tax of ₹100 per month and for those earning more than ₹10 lakh a year, a tax of ₹200 per month was proposed. With these taxes, the EDMC hopes to increase its revenue by at least ₹30 crore, it said.</p>
      <p>With regard to property tax rates, EDMC had proposed to increase the rate charged from properties in the C, D and E categories from 11- 12% and for properties in the F, G and H categories from 7-10%.</p>
      <p>The proposals would have to be approved by the deliberative wing of the EDMC before being implemented.</p>
      <p>While the EDMC had to revise its estimates for external sources of revenue down by about ₹1,300 crore, the civic body has significantly revised its upwards global share of taxes based on recommendations of the Fifth Delhi Finance Commission. From an earlier estimate of ₹250 crore, the EDMC now expects to end the year with ₹1,038 crore.</p>
      <p>The Commissioner said that with the new devolution formula and funds received based on the latest DFC’s recommendations, the east civic body was just able to manage it’s day-to-day expenses.</p>
