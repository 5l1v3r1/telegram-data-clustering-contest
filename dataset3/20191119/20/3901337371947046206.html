      <p>Kaizer Chiefs star Khama Billiat bagged two goals as Zimbabwe got their first 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifying victory on Tuesday evening.</p>
      <p>Chipolopolo coach Aggrey Chiyangi made five changes to the lost to Algeria, as RB Leipzig duo Enock Mwepa and Patson Daka, Mwenya Chibwe, Donashano Malama and Tandi Mwepe were drafted into the starting line-up.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, the Warriors made only one change from their goalless draw with Botswana, as SuperSport United winger Kudakwashe Mahachi took the place of Golden Arrows striker Knox Mutizwa.</p>
      <p>Joey Antipas' troops had a great start after Billiat opened the scoring in the 11th minute with a headed effort that came off the underside of the crossbar for his first goal of the qualifying campaign.</p>
      <p>Zambia restored parity nine minutes later through Daka who broke free down the left before rifling the ball home at goalkeeper Elvis Chipezeze's near post</p>
      <p>The sides could not maintain the frantic pace of the first stanza early in the second-half, which forced the visitors to make a change Prince Dube replaced Mahachi.</p>
      <p>Chipolopolo had spells of sustained attacks in the latter phase, with the Warriors struggling to get out of their own half, however, Billiat gave restored the visitors' lead with 11 minutes remaining with an easy tap-in courtesy of Knowledge Musona's assist to complete his brace.</p>
      <p>Zimbabwe were able to see out the closing stages to claim the win and move up to second spot with four points, while Chipolopolo remain rock bottom.</p>
