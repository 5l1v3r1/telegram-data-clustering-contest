      <h2>AQI was in ‘poor’ category on Tuesday</h2>

      <p>The air quality of Delhi stayed in the ‘poor’ category on Tuesday and is expected to fall to the ‘severe’ on Thursday and Friday, said forecasting agency SAFAR.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, the average level of PM 2.5 was twice (122.6.3 ug/m3) the safe limit (60ug/m3) in Delhi-NCR at 6 p.m., as per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). But the level is nearly five times the safe limit (25 ug/m3) set by the World Health Organization (WHO).</p>
      <p>The contribution of stubble burning in neighbouring States to Delhi’s pollution was 13% on Tuesday, and is expected to rise to 14% on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Delhi’s Air Quality Index (AQI) on Tuesday was 242 (poor), up from 214 (poor) on Monday, as per the 4 p.m. bulletin by the CPCB.</p>
      <p>“The AQI is likely to deteriorate to the higher end of ‘very poor’ category by early Wednesday and then further deteriorate to the lower end of ‘severe’ category by early Thursday. AQI is likely to stay in the ‘severe’ category on Friday,” said SAFAR.</p>
      <p>The wind speed has already shown a decreasing trend and is likely to be very calm during the next 48 hours. Calm wind and low ventilation index are predicted for the next two days and conditions are conducive for sudden accumulation of pollutants in Delhi. The ‘severe’ air quality is not expected to last long. “A fresh western disturbance is expected to increase wind speed and improve ventilation by Saturday,” said SAFAR.</p>
