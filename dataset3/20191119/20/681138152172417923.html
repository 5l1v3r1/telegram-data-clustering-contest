      <p>Firefighters attended an address in Greenway in the seaside town at around 11.50am on Tuesday, November 19, after smoke alarms were set off in the property.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Essex County Fire and Rescue Service said: "On arrival, crews reported that the kitchen was smoke logged after a pan was left on the hob unattended and the resident had gone out.</p>
      <p>"Firefighters used fans to clear the smoke in the premises."</p>
      <p>After the incident, the fire service issued the following safety advice, reminding the public that more than half of accidental fires at home are caused by cooking.</p>
      <p>-Avoid leaving children in the kitchen alone when cooking on the hob. Keep matches and saucepan handles out of their reach to keep them safe.</p>
      <p>-Make sure saucepan handles don't stick out - so they don't get knocked off the stove.</p>
      <p>-Take care if you're wearing loose clothing - this can easily catch fire.</p>
      <p>-Keep tea towels and cloths away from the cooker and hob.</p>
      <p>-Double check the cooker is off when you've finished cooking.</p>
      <p>-Take care if you need to leave the kitchen whilst cooking, take pans off the heat or turn them down to avoid risk.</p>
