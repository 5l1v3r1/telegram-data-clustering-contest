      <h1>Gary Lineker has a warning for Tottenham after Pochettino sacking</h1>
      <h2>Tottenham Hotspur are now on the hunt for a new manager.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T20:26:56+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 20:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/mathewcoull/" target="_blank">Mathew Nash</a></address>
      <p>Tottenham Hotspur have parted company with manager Mauricio Pochettino after a difficult start to the 2019-20 campaign. Despite taking Tottenham to the Champions League final last season, Tottenham have struggled this term and Pochettino has been relieved of his duties along with the rest of his coaching staff. </p>
      <p>The Argentine had turned Tottenham into a serious force in recent years. However, a stagnation of the current squad has seen performances dip and Tottenham are currently struggling at the wrong end of the Premier League table. </p>

      <p>However, plenty are of the belief that Tottenham are making a big mistake. The Argentine is immensely popular with the Tottenham fans, even amid their recent poor form. </p>
      <p>One such opinion comes from former Tottenham and England striker Gary Lineker. He feels Tottenham have made a big mistake in the sacking of Pochettino and that they will struggle to find anyone who can do a better job than the popular form Southampton manager. </p>

      <p>Lineker was not alone. NBA legend and popular Tottenham fan Steve Nash was ‘devastated’ by the news. Jamie Carragher however, feels the current project had run its course. </p>
