      <h1>Tipalti Puts AP Closer To AR With YayPay</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T20:17:01+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 20:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.pymnts.com/author/pymnts/" target="_blank">PYMNTS</a></address>
      <p>Accounts payable (AP) automation company <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/investment-tracker/2019/tipalti-raises-76m-led-by-zeev-ventures/">Tipalti</a> is getting closer to the accounts receivable (AR) side of B2B transactions with a new partnership.</p>
      <p>The company <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tipalti-adds-partnerships-kodella-escalon-130000144.html">announced</a> Tuesday (Nov. 19) that it is collaborating with AR automation software provider <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2018/yaypay-venture-funding-ar-automation/">YayPay</a>. YayPay connects businesses to AR automation technology to help increase invoice collection and predict cash flow. Collaborating with Tipalti, said YayPay, means joint business customers will be able to further automate their payables and receivables workflows.</p>
      <p>“YayPay is pleased to have developed this relationship with Tipalti to help our joint clients better scale their global supplier payment and collection processes,” said YayPay Co-Founder and CEO Anthony Venus. “As companies grow and transform, they need to modernize their finance operations, transitioning AP and AR departments from cost-centers to profit-centers by providing tools that turn their finance teams into ‘revenue heroes.’”</p>
      <p>“AP and AR automation are critical pieces of the overall equation to solve our clients’ enterprise-wide cash flow management needs,” he added.</p>
      <p>Tipalti’s partnership announcement coincided with the launch of two other collaborations.</p>
      <p>The AP company is also working with Escalon Services, which provides a suite of back-office business services, including accounting, payroll and HR tools. Escalon will connect its business customers to Tipalti’s AP technologies.</p>
      <p>The company also revealed a partnership with Kodella, which provides Oracle NetSuite implementation services.</p>
      <p>“We’re excited to be partnering with client-focused organizations, such as Kodella, Escalon Services and YayPay, to help streamline their clients’ finance workflows,” said Tipalti Co-Founder and CEO <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2019/cross-border-accounts-payable-global-growth/">Chen Amit</a>. “We look forward to working together to provide our mutual customers with a best-in-class financial operation, along with enabling their continuing growth.”</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.pymnts.com/news/b2b-payments/2019/accounts-payable-automation-tipalti-partnership/">Tipalti announced</a> additional collaborations with Big Bang ERP, Procurify and Tesorio in an initiative to integrate Tipalti’s AP technology with its partners’ various B2B services.</p>
