      <p>The murder suspect allegedly slaughtered John McGuire, 38, battered him over the head and injected him with crystal meth before dumping his body in West Virginia. He wrote a letter to the court on November 4 admitting his part in the slaying of daughter Amanda McClure’s boyfriend. The letter goes into detail about how McGuire was beaten, injected and strangled.</p>
      <p>McClure and his daughters Amanda, 31, and Anna Marie Choudhry, 32, have been charged with murder.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, a criminal complaint revealed that just four weeks after the slaying Larry and Amanda married each other. West Virginia State Police Trooper K.M. Saddler said additional charges could be filed.</p>
      <p>State police also say the trio buried McGuire’s body shallow grave at McClure’s home in Skygusty of McDowell County.</p>
      <p>All three are currently being held in South Central Regional Jail.</p>
