      <h1>California sues e-cigarette firm Juul for targeting minors</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T09:05:01+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 09:05</time> by <a rel="author">Agence France-Presse </a></address>
      <p>California announced Monday it is suing Juul, the United States’ largest electronic cigarette manufacturer, for illegally targeting minors with its marketing campaigns.</p>
      <p>E-cigarettes have soared in popularity among young people since they were introduced about a decade ago. California law prohibits the sale of vaporizing products to persons under the age of 21.</p>
      <p>A joint lawsuit filed by California Attorney General Xavier Becerra and his Los Angeles counterpart alleges that Juul Labs failed to meet its obligations to verify the age of its customers.</p>
      <p>“Today, we take legal action against the deceptive practices that Juul and the e-cigarette industry employ to lure our kids into their vaping web,” said Becerra.</p>
      <p>“We will hold Juul and any other company that fuels a public health crisis accountable.”</p>
      <p>The San Francisco-based firm also retained the email addresses of customers it had identified as minors in order to send them advertisements, according to the lawsuit.</p>
      <p>Juul sales represent more than 64 percent of all e-cigarettes in the US.</p>
      <p>The company has denied that its products — including mango, mint and creme brulee-flavored e-cigarettes — were aimed at minors.</p>
      <p>Ahead of a possible ban by health authorities, the firm this month pulled its mint-flavored products after a study found it was the favorite flavor among high school students.</p>
      <p>It now sells only three flavors in the US: two tobacco-flavored varieties and menthol.</p>
      <p>US federal regulators this summer opened an investigation into potentially “deceptive marketing” by Juul.</p>
      <p>Juul said at the time it has “never marketed to youth” but said it regretted a 2015 marketing campaign aimed at 25-34 adults that “executed in a way that was perceived as appealing to minors.”</p>
      <p>“JUUL adopted the tobacco industry’s infamous playbook, employing advertisements that had no regard for public health and searching out vulnerable targets,” Becerra said Monday.</p>
      <p>The lawsuit comes as the vaping industry is facing tough scrutiny amid a mysterious epidemic of lung conditions linked to e-cigarette use that has killed more than 40 people and sickened more than 2,000 in recent months.</p>
