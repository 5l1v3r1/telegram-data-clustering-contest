      <p><b>Thought for today:</b> “You can always tell gifted and highly intelligent people as they always turn to the past. Any young person who knows anything that happened before 1980, or 1990, or 2000 for that matter, is immediately someone who is intelligent, probably creative, maybe a writer. Nobody who is drawn to the past and learning about the past is not gifted.” — Mike Nichols (film director, born in 1931, died on this date in 2014)</p>
