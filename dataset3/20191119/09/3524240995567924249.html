      <p>The Nigerian Army says its troops have repelled an attack by Boko Haram terrorists in Dikwa Local Government Area of Borno State.</p>
      <p>The Nigerian Army Operations Media Coordinator, Col. Aminu Iliyasu, disclosed this in a statement on Monday in Abuja.</p>
      <p>Iliyasu said that the encounter took place on Monday when troops of 153 Task Force Battalion deployed at New Marte embarked on patrol to Dikwa.</p>
      <p>According to him, the troops encountered an ambush staged against them by some remnants of the Boko Haram insurgents along the patrol route at Ala Village, 7 km away from New Marte.</p>
      <p>“The ambush was reinforced with a crudely prepared Improvised Explosive Device planted by them against the troops.</p>
      <p>“In a rare display of boldness, resilience and faithful service to their fatherland, the troops, turned around the initial setback and dealt a devastating blow on the criminals.</p>
      <p>“Having so clearly asserted their superiority in the ensuing firefight, the criminal insurgents were forced to flee in disarray.</p>
      <p>The gallant troops then embarked on a relentless pursuit of the scampering insurgents who abandoned some of their fighting equipment in utter confusion,” he said.</p>
      <p>Iliyasu disclosed that the troops recovered two Gun Trucks, two Anti-Air Craft Guns, 2,080 Rounds of 7.62mm NATO ammunition and 26 Rounds of 12.7 mm Armour Piercing Incendiary ammunition at end of the pursuit and exploitation.</p>
      <p>He added that three AK 47 Rifles, six Rounds of 12.7 mm (Belted), one AOJOE motorcycle, some clothes, foodstuffs and mechanical tools belonging to the criminals were also captured by the troops.</p>
