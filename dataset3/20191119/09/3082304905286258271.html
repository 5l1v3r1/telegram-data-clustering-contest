      <h1>Rashford hails England’s ‘frightening’ attacking arsenal</h1>

        <b>England scored 37 goals in Euro 2020 qualifying and Marcus Rashford is excited about what the team can do at the tournament proper.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Marcus Rashford believes England’s “frightening” attacking talent can power the World Cup semi-finalists to a successful Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>Gareth Southgate’s side cruised through qualifying for next year’s tournament, winning seven of eight matches and scoring 37 times.</p>
      <p>Only once before – in 1908 – have England struck more goals in competitive matches in a calendar year than the 38 scored in 2019.</p>
      <p>Question marks remain over certain positions in the starting XI but in Rashford, Harry Kane and Raheem Sterling there looks to be a defined and dangerous attacking trio.</p>
      <p>“I think it is a good combination,” said Manchester United forward Rashford.</p>
      <p>“But we have played games without that particular front three and it is frightening what we can do as a group of attackers.</p>
      <p>“I think all of these games are just gearing you up for the summer and if we go into the summer anywhere near the sort of form we have been in recently then it will be a successful tournament.”</p>

      <p>Rashford was among the scorers as England signed off from qualifying with a 4-0 win over Kosovo on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Jadon Sancho, Tammy Abraham and Callum Hudson-Odoi, who started in Pristina, are among those pressing for spots, while Jamie Vardy could add another element to the squad if the in-form Leicester City striker reverses his international retirement.</p>
      <p>Rashford said: “I have been in two tournaments now and the squad is so important.</p>
      <p>“With the qualities that every individual has in this team, it is something we have to use to our advantage. People are going to be playing at different moments but when you are on the pitch you have to do your best and try to come up with the goods.</p>
      <p>“It is good competition. We really do have that kind of environment when we are in the camp together and it is positive.”</p>
