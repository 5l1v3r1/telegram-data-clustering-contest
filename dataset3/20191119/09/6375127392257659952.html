      <h3>DON’T be too overly materialistic, live simple life as much as possible and learn to stop chasing things that simply don’t matter.</h3>
      <p>The officer-in-charge (OIC) of the Philippine National Police (PNP), Lt/Gen. Archie Francisco Gamboa, issued the simple reminder to the 195,000 officers and men of the country’s premier law enforcement agency.</p>
      <p>Gamboa said members of the PNP, which is civilian in nature but national in scope, must work closely together to make the agency truly worthy and deserving of the Filipino people’s trust and respect.</p>
      <p>People described the reminder as timely, coming at a time when the PNP is in the midst of an intensified internal cleansing program, which has resulted in the arrest and dismissal of dozens of rogue cops.</p>
      <p>These erring police officers and men tried to earn big money through illegal means, including robbery-extortion, kidnapping and other highly-irregular anti-narcotics operations, said Gamboa.</p>
      <p>He said law enforcers are surrounded by a materialistic culture and get to experience first-hand the kind of happiness it brings when we obtain a specific title or object.</p>
      <p>It is not necessarily bad to have new cars, but many times the reasons why we crave these things are a bit misconstrued, said Gamboa during the donning of rank of newly-promoted PNP generals.</p>
      <p>They are M/General Jose Chiquito Malayo and B/Generals Jonnel Estomo, Mathew Baccay, Ildebrande Usana and Remus Canieso.</p>
      <p>Through quiet and hard work, the leadership of the nation’s premier law enforcement agency is showing that transforming our men and women in uniform is a gigantic task but not an impossible mission.</p>
      <p>But with well-meaning cop officers, like Gamboa, we are made to believe that the government is capable of restoring the Filipino people’s trust and confidence in their policemen.</p>
