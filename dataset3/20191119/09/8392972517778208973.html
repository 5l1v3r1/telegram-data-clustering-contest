      <p>Viewers of <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a> are divided over Adele Roberts' luxury item - a photo of actress Jane McDonald - which she received during last night's show.</p>
      <p>Kate Garraway, Nadine Coyle, Roman Kemp, Myles Stephenson and Adele competed in a late night challenge to try and win all the stars' luxury items.</p>
      <p>The instructions read: "Your job is to get each item from the wheel onto the basket however you can only use the oars. You will win each luxury item that reaches the basket."</p>

      <p>The stars had to pass each box - which contained the luxury item - down the row on their oars without dropping it into the swamp below.</p>
      <p>However, they only managed to retrieve two of the boxes - Adele's picture of former <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/loose-women/">Loose Women</a> star Jane and Kate's concealer.</p>

      <p>While many viewers found Adele's luxury item hilarious, others weren't happy that other campmates lost out on their items such as family photos.</p>
      <p>One person said on Twitter: "What a ridiculous choice of item."</p>
      <p>Another wrote: "So Kate and Adele get their luxury items which was concealer and a photo of Jane McDonald and all the others didn’t and they were more important gifts? How useless."</p>
