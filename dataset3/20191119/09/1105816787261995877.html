      <h1>Tamaasha's latest music video shines light on a dark world</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T09:33:55+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 09:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tribune.com.pk/author/8823/asfa-sultantribune-com-pk/" target="_blank">Asfa Sultan</a></address>
      <p>It’s year 2545 and Tamaasha is still not coming slow, as they decide to bring an outer space performance to their latest music video. <i>Roshni. </i>The song is to date, the most motivational one they’ve made, however, when people heard it last year in Battle of the Bands, no one imagined living in a world without oxygen. Nor could they have guessed the five band members would appear as astronauts bringing the planet back to life – literally.</p>

      <p>The video takes off with their super hero fantasies, into an intergalactic mission to restore the atmospheric filter of a planet – the name of which has not been specified. The code name for the mission is (bet you would have never guessed it), Roshni.</p>
      <p>The pact including Bilal Ahmad, Zahid Qureshi, Anas Lutfi, Haider Ali and Ali Raza Soomro, who is also the director of the video, are seen traveling in a spaceship, with the help of computer generated imagery (CGI), of course.</p>

      <p>However, the corridor of the spaceship is completely art directed and quite remarkably at that, along with the space suit designs of course.</p>
      <p>The musicians (read astronauts) apparently generate several kinds of codes incorporating their knowledge of algebraic expressions, and Pythagoras theorem (which may have finally been put to use, pun intended), to  enter a parallel universe where they find this mysterious planet.</p>
      <p>The video progresses to show three individuals who are apparently always wearing oxygen masks while performing their daily activities, on a dystopian planet that struggles to produce livelihood.</p>

      <p>The concept of the video also hints at the current detrimental situation of the environment and reinforces the idea of bringing change.</p>
      <p>Given the circumstances, the astronauts spread out in search for some ray of hope and end up discovering a cube (the powers of which have not been specified), but appears to be inspired by those in <i>Transformers</i> or Marvel films.</p>
      <p>Following this, the fantastic five gather inside a high-tech room where they take out another container, withholding some kind of particles which they use to restore life on the planet.</p>

      <p>The video is most certainly a work of art along with the concept which flows in accordance with the problems we are facing today. The song, on the other hand, had already won several hearts and can now be re-imagined and integrated for different motivational purposes.</p>
