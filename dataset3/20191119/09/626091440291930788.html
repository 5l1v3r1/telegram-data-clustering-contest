      <p>Sweden has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/nov/19/sweden-drops-julian-assange-investigation">dropped an investigation into a rape allegation made against Julian Assange</a>. From a report:<i> The deputy chief prosecutor, Eva-Marie Persson, told a news conference: "I want to inform about my decision to discontinue the <a href="https://news.slashdot.org/story/10/08/21/1138240/julian-assange-faces-rape-investigation-in-sweden-updated">preliminary investigation</a>." The decision on Tuesday follows a ruling in June by a Swedish court that Assange, who denies the accusation, should not be detained. Two months earlier, the WikiLeaks founder was <a href="https://news.slashdot.org/story/19/05/20/2153239/ecuador-hands-over-julian-assanges-belongings-to-us">evicted from the Ecuadorian embassy in London</a>, where he had been living since 2012.</i></p>
