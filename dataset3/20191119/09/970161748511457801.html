      <h1>Someone keeps leaving cash bundles of £2,000 around a village</h1>

      <p>There could be a Good Samaritan who keeps leaving thousands of pounds in streets in County Durham.</p>
      <p>Police and villagers are confused about why the cash, almost always £2,000 in £20 notes, appeared 12 times over the last five years.</p>
      <p>Four bundles have been left just this year, with the latest found on Monday morning.</p>
      <p>They are always left in plain sight, although in different locations throughout the village.</p>
      <p>Detectives have tried to figure out why they keep appearing, and have even carried out finger print checks, but so far they still have no idea.</p>
      <p>Could it be someone very rich but also forgetful, or is it intentional?</p>
      <p>Police praised honest residents of Blackhall Colliery for handing in the money.</p>
      <p>They got to keep it in the end anyway, as the cash is held for two weeks to give the owner a chance to come forward and then returned to the finder.</p>

      <p>Detective Constable John Forster, of Peterlee CID, said the team had interviewed numerous people and organisations in the village as well as carrying out checks with the local bank and post office and even tested for fingerprints, but the circumstances surrounding the bundles of money remain a mystery.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘These bundles are always left in plain sight such as on pavements and discovered by random members of the public who have handed them in.</p>

      <p>‘This could be the work of a Good Samaritan but we would like to thank the residents who have shown incredible community spirit by handing the money in.</p>
      <p>‘The circumstances remain a mystery so we would welcome any information that will help us get to the bottom of these random incidents.’</p>
      <p>Commenting on the police Facebook post, one user said: ‘You don’t see this every day!! A good deal. Find £2,000, hand it in and if nobody claims it the finder gets it. If that’s an act of kindness it’s a lovely Christmas present for the person finding it.’</p>
      <p>John Price speculated: ‘Perhaps,someone who’s done bad to the people of Blackhall Colliery in the past, many years ago and now seeking forgiveness…’</p>
      <p>But Gary Storey said: ‘What a nice thing to do. Would love to help people and see their reaction, especially if they were struggling to make ends meet. Well done to that kind soul.’</p>
