      <p><a href="http://www.broomx.com/">Broomx</a>, a Barcelona-based immersive technology startup, has closed a €2 million seed round, which includes investments from Wayra, BStartup of Banco Sabadell, Stornoway, and several angel investors from the UK and Luxembourg. The new investment will help the company expand across Europe and into the US.</p>
      <p>Broomx has created a virtual reality projector, the MK360, which allows people to share immersive VR experiences in physical spaces without using headsets. The technology is already being used in 20 countries by various organisations. Customers include hotel groups such as Catalonia Hotels and Marriott, corporations such as Skoda, Asepeyo, and Japanese NTT Docomo, and universities such as UCLA in Los Angeles.</p>
      <p>Widening the use cases even further is Broomx’ participation in a clinical study in Canada. The Canadian Ministry of Health of Canada is funding a study on the impact of immersive technologies in the treatment of patients with Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
      <p>Founded in 2014 by two brothers, Diego and Pedro Serrano, the startup recently finished a six-month incubation programme with Abbey Road Studios’ music tech incubator, Abbey Road Red.</p>
