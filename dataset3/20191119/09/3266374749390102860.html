      <h1>Transfer News: Willian open to Barcelona move amid Chelsea contract offer</h1>

      <h3>Willian is reportedly willing to snub a two-year contract extension at Chelsea in favour of a move to Barcelona in the January transfer window.</h3>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.mundodeportivo.com/futbol/fc-barcelona/20191118/471704579606/barca-fabian-willian-chelsea-napoles.html">Mundo Deportivo</a>, Willian is open to a move to Barcelona in January as he seeks to take the next step in his career. It is believed that the Brazilian is even willing to snub a two-year contract extension being offered by Chelsea in order to secure a switch to Camp Nou.</p>
      <p>Willian’s current contract at Stamford Bridge expires at the end of the season, meaning Barcelona can begin negotiating a pre-contract agreement with the Chelsea winger in January over a Bosman move. But, if they do make a move, they are likely to secure his services right away due to the dearth of reliable options in the attacking department.</p>
      <p>The Spanish giants strengthened their offensive unit in the summer by signing Antoine Griezmann. Barcelona were also interested in bringing back Neymar, <a href="http://www.thehardtackle.com/news/2019/08/29/transfer-news-psg-reject-latest-barcelona-offer-for-neymar/">but a move failed to materialise</a>.</p>
      <p>Griezmann has blown hot and cold since arriving at Catalonia. Furthermore, the injury problems of star men Lionel Messi and Ousmane Dembele, coupled with the departure of Philippe Coutinho on loan has forced Ernesto Valverde to rely on youngsters like Carles Perez and Ansu Fati, at times.</p>

      <p>To that end, <a href="http://www.thehardtackle.com/news/2019/11/14/transfer-rumour-barcelona-keeping-tabs-on-willian">Barcelona are keeping tabs on Willian</a>, who would add some much-needed depth in the attacking department. The Brazilian has a wealth of experience at the highest level of football, which could prove to be crucial as the club looks to regain the UEFA Champions League title while maintaining their dominance in Spanish football.</p>
      <p>As for Chelsea, they are appear as unlucky in this whole scenario. Willian is quite happy and feels valued at the club, which means there is nothing much they could do as far as keeping hold of their star player is concerned.</p>
      <p>Willian has been a useful player for the Blues over the years, and his experience could aid Frank Lampard, who is trying to build his squad around talented, young players. The likes of Christian Pulisic, Mason Mount and Callum Hudson-Odoi have already started making waves.</p>
      <p>But, at the same time, they also need someone who can handle pressure in a high stakes encounter. That is where the presence of players like Willian and Pedro has aided Chelsea.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, the Blues will be able to sign players from next summer, which means they might have no difficulty in replacing the Brazilian. But, one thing is certain, Willian’s possible departure in January could cause some serious problems for Lampard for the remainder of the campaign. It now remains to be seen if Barcelona do make a move for Willian, who is keen on a switch.</p>
