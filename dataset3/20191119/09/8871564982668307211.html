      <h1>Singapore, Philippine travelers can now book rides in Japan, Middle East via Grab</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T09:37:53+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 09:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Singapore" target="_blank">Coconuts Singapore</a></address>
      <p>Travelers from Singapore and the Philippines can now use Grab to book rides while vacationing in Japan and the Middle East, the ride-hailing company has announced. </p>
      <p>Grab teamed up with services in Japan and several Middle Eastern locales for the new service that will also overcome language barriers for traveler convenience.</p>
      <p>It has now launched in Tokyo, Kyoto, Nagoya, Sapporo, and Okinawa through the JapanTaxi app. Via Careem app, it is also available in most parts of the Middle East as well as Turkey and Pakistan. That includes cities such as Dubai, Baghdad, and Beirut. </p>
      <p>Users can chat easily with their drivers as the app now comes with an auto-translation feature. Passengers can type in their preferred languages and their messages will be translated for the driver, and vice-versa. </p>
      <p>Payments are made through the GrabPay e-wallet, so probably a good idea to top it up with credit before flying off. </p>
      <p>This nifty new feature could be rolled out to other parts of Southeast Asia next year subject to regulatory approval, Grab said. </p>
