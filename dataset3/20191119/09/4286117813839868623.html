      <p>Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior is special to Ajay Devgn in more ways than one. In the war drama, he is sharing the big screen with wife Kajol for the first time after the 2008 film U Me Aur Hum. Tanhaji also marks his 100th film in the Hindi film industry. And apart from all that, Tanhaji brings back the crackling on-screen dynamics between Ajay Devgn and Saif Ali Khan, something we last saw in the 2006 film Omkara.</p>
      <p>The makers launched the trailer of Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior in Mumbai today. The film is directed by Om Raut.</p>
      <p>Ajay is seen as brave Maratha warrior Tanhaji Malusare in the film. He fought the Battle of Sinhagad against Udaybhan Singh Rathod, played by Saif Ali Khan. Maratha leader Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj wanted to recapture Kondhana fort from the Mughals, and Tanhaji took charge of the battle.</p>
      <p>The action-packed trailer shows Saif and Ajay preparing for the battle. Kajol, who is seen in the role of Tanhaji's wife Savitribai Malusare, has a pivotal part to play in the film. She supports her husband through and through as he goes to battle against Udaybhan.</p>
