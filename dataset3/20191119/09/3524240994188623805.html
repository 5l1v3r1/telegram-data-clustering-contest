      <p><b>Lesotho</b> coach Thabo Senong has hailed the Super Eagles after they defeated his team 4-2 in their 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier clash on Sunday in Maseru.</p>
      <p>Nigeria came from a goal down, to defeat the South African side 4-2 in the encounter.</p>
      <p>Alex Iwobi, drew Nigeria level in the 26th minute, after Nkoto Masoabi had put Lesotho ahead.</p>
      <p>Further goals came from Samuel Chukwueze and Victor Osimhen, with two, before Chidozie Awaziem scored an own goal to ensure the game ended 4-2.</p>
      <p>Senong conceded the Eagles were a very good team, and praised them for coming back into the game, and winning from 1-0 down.</p>
      <p>“For me, I don’t have much to say about our defeat to Nigeria, I think to come back from 1-0 down to win is not that easy,” Senong told reporters.</p>
      <p>“I will say we played against a very good team today (Sunday).”</p>
      <p>Lesotho’s next qualifier is a double-header against Benin in August and September 2020.</p>
      <p>Nigeria will host Lesotho in the return leg of the encounter on November 9, 2020.</p>
