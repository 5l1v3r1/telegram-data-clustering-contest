      <p>Bernard Budworth was resuscitated by emergency services after members of the public dragged him from the canal in Ellesmere on September 14, but he had suffered a serious brain injury and died in hospital six days later.</p>
      <p>The inquest into his death heard that Mr Budworth, from Warrington in Cheshire, was on a canal break with his wife, when he left their boat to collect some food for them both.</p>
      <p>Senior coroner John Ellery summarised a statement by Mrs Budworth, who attended the hearing along with other family members.</p>
      <p>He said at that 8.20pm she heard a noise, which turned out to be Mr Budworth entering the canal.</p>
      <p>Mr Ellery said: “The police investigated and the most plausible scenarios are that your husband lost his footing or had a medical episode when he tried to get back onto the boat.</p>
      <h3>Accident</h3>
      <p>“What is clear is that, however it happened, it was an accident.”</p>
      <p>A statement was read to the hearing from Douglas Yelland, who heard Mrs Budworth screaming and rushed to help.</p>
      <p>He described how he and two others pulled Mr Budworth, who was face-down in the canal, onto the towpath.</p>
      <p>Police and ambulance staff arrived and managed to resuscitate Mr Budworth, who was taken to the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital.</p>
      <p>His condition deteriorated and he was transferred to the Severn Hospice, where he died on September 20.</p>
      <p>The medical cause of death was given as acute hypoxic brain injury, caused by Mr Budworth almost drowning.</p>
      <p>Mr Ellery recorded a conclusion of accidental death. He added that some of the people who helped Mr Budworth on that night had been put forward for an award from the Royal Humane Society.</p>
