      <p>SEATTLE — Isaiah Stewart dominated on the interior and scored 16 points, Quade Green added 11 points on 5-for-5 shooting, and No. 25 Washington rebounded from its first loss of the season with a 72-53 win over Maine on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>The Huskies (3-1) were handed their first setback over the weekend in a 75-62 loss to No. 20 Tennessee on a neutral court in Toronto, but began a stretch of three games in six days with a convincing victory where Washington finally found a rhythm at the offensive end.</p>
      <p>The Huskies shot a season-best 46% despite going just 3 of 15 on 3-point attempts. Stewart, the Huskies’ bruising 6-foot-9 freshman, overpowered the Bears in the paint. But getting Green going offensively was an important development as he is Washington’s most experienced guard. The Kentucky transfer was shooting just 30% from the field through the first three games.</p>
      <p>Andrew Fleming and Nedeljko Prijovic led the Black Bears (1-3) with 18 points each. Maine was unable to overcome shooting just 33% and committing 14 turnovers in the first half.</p>
      <p>Washington started sluggishly for the fourth straight game, but quickly got its offense ignited thanks to Nahziah Carter. Washington scored 15 straight points midway through the first half, including a trio of highlight dunks from the junior. Carter’s first came off a lob from Jaden McDaniels. He added another lob dunk from Green and capped his five minutes of highlights with a windmill dunk on a breakaway that gave Washington a 32-13 lead.</p>
      <p>Peter Stumer finally snapped the run with a 3 for the Black Bears, but any chance Maine had of keeping the game close was gone. Washington led 36-18 at halftime and by as many as 24 in the second half.</p>
