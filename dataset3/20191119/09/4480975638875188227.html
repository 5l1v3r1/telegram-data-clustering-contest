      <h1>USD/JPY Technical Analysis: Climbs to session tops, eyeing a move towards 109.00 handle</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T09:55:17+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 09:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/haresh-menghani" target="_blank">Haresh Menghani</a></address>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Quickly reverses an early dip and climbs to session tops.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Bulls are likely to wait for a move beyond 109.00 level.</b>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The USD/JPY pair built on a goodish intraday bounce from two-day lows and is currently placed near the top end of its daily trading range, around the 108.80 region.<br/> <br/>A turnaround in the risk <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/sentiment">sentiment</a>, reinforced by a pickup in the US Treasury bond yields, weighed on the Japanese yen's safe-haven status and remained supportive.<br/> <br/>The uptick has now lifted the pair back above 100-hour SMA, which might be seen as a key trigger for bullish traders and support prospects for additional intraday gains.<br/> <br/>Meanwhile, oscillators on the daily chart maintained their bullish bias and have again started gaining positive traction on hourly charts, reinforcing the constructive set-up.<br/> <br/>However, it will be prudent to wait for a sustained move beyond the very important 200-day SMA, or the 109.00 handle, before positioning for any further appreciating move.<br/> <br/>Above the mentioned barrier, the pair is likely to aim towards monthly tops, around the mid-109.00s, before eventually darting towards the key 110.00 psychological mark.</p>
