        <b>Huge blow for Zimbabweans in SA using Zimbabwe Special Permit</b>
      </p>
      <p>Zimbabweans in South Africa who benefited from the special <a href="https://iharare.com/special-permits-updates/">ZEP permits</a> (Zimbabwe Special Permits) are panicking after word came out that South Africa will not be renewing or coming up with another special permit once the current ones expire.</p>
      <p>Back in 2010, over 300 000 <a href="https://www.vfsglobal.com/ZEP/SouthAfrica/">Zimbabweans in South Africa</a> benefited from the special 4-year permit which was extended when it lapsed in 2014. Another special permit was also introduced which expired in 2017. Now on the third renewal, the number of Zimbabweans on the permit has dwindled with only 179000 applying for the current one.</p>
      <p>The news that the permit will not be extended has been met with uncertainty over the many Zimbabweans who have settled in South Africa as it means they will be forced to go back to Zimbabwe. Some Zimbabwean on the special permit had chosen to engage lawyers in order for them to exhaust other avenues to legally stay in South Africa.</p>

      <p>The Zimbabwe Exemption Permit (ZEP) allows Zimbabweans to work and study in South Africa legally for 4 years. Not renewing the special permit would cause unimaginable damages to the thousands of Zimbabweans who are benefitting from it.</p>
      <p>Some beneficiaries from the permit had also hinted on starting a petition to have the Department of Home Affairs reconsider on their stance. South Africa is currently faced with a huge influx of foreigners and the tension has seen xenophobic violence erupting in the last couple of years.</p>
      <p>Currently, there are over 180 foreigners who are camped at the United Nations offices in South Africa demanding to be taken to a better country like Canada.</p>
      <p>This is a developing story.</p>
