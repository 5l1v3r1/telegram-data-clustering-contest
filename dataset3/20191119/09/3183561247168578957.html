      <p>Next year, HBO will debut a new comedy about a space cruise, captained by <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/tom-hiddleston-and-hugh-laurie-will-soon-have-a-spy-sho-1750138235">Hugh Laurie</a>, where everything goes wrong. That sentence alone would make most of us watch, but this next one ups the ante even further: It’s created by Armando Iannucci, who did <i>Veep</i>.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/04/hbo-greenlights-the-space-tourism-comedy-avenue-5">The show is called <i>Avenue 5</i></a> and if you think about the awkward, hilarious, smart humour of Iannucci’s other work, then filter it through a <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/humanity-cannot-be-saved-in-wall-e-5020391">grand idea like <i>Wall-E</i></a>, you begin to get the idea. <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/05/josh-gad-may-star-in-a-honey-i-shrunk-the-kids-rebootsequel">Josh Gad</a>, Suzy Nakamura, Zach Woods, and others are also along for the ride and the first trailer is right here.</p>

      <p>Evil Hugh Laurie? Weirdo Josh Gad? A space-cruise that <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/08/we-finally-have-more-details-on-that-star-wars-hotel-thats-not-really-a-hotel-at-all">Disney is basically building for real</a> in the next few years? Yeah, we’re on board with this for sure. In fact, we can’t wait.</p>

      <p>That trailer is so fun and quirky and beautiful, it feels like it’s for a show that shouldn’t even exist. We’re getting strong <a href="http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2019/09/the-beautifully-dull-paradox-of-star-trek-the-motion-picture-40-years-later"><i>Star Trek</i></a><i> </i>meets <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-poseidon-adventure-is-still-one-of-the-most-insane-1750188807"><i>The Poseidon Adventure</i></a> meets <i>Veep</i> vibes? We guess? The whole thing is almost too weird for words. But that’s what gives us hope.</p>
      <p><i>Avenue 5</i> debuts in January on HBO.</p>
