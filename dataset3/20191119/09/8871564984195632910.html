      <p>A tiny cafe stand known for kick-ass coffee served by a 70-year-old barista has moved to a new location.</p>
      <p>Ploenpit Rianmek, aka “Pa Pim,” relocated Mother Roaster on Friday a few blocks over to a bigger home in the charming Talad Noi enclave.</p>

      <p>First opened in February on Mahaphruttharam Road as a wooden stand with only two stools, Mother Roaster was suddenly the talk of the town, not only for quality cups of joe, but also Ploenpit, the septuagenarian barista-auntie behind the counter who grabs her ROK espresso maker to hand-drip the coffee herself.</p>
      <p>Apart from a bigger venue that can accommodate more customers, the cafe’s new digs offer a view of the mighty Chao Phraya River.</p>
      <p>The menu list and prices are unchanged. They include Iced Latte OnTheRok (THB80), Black Honey Lime (THB80) and Single Snow White (espresso shot shaken with cold with starts at THB90). They use coffee beans grown domestically as well as those imported from Brazil, Kenya and Ethiopia.</p>
      <p>Mother Roaster is located in the San Chao Rong Kueak alley in the Talad Noi neighborhood of Bangkok’s old town.</p>
