      <h3>WWE Rumors: Legendary Superstar Reportedly Being Considered For Return At ‘Survivor Series’</h3>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>With less than a week remaining before this year’s <i>Survivor Series</i>, <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/wwe/">WWE</a> reportedly has some last-minute plans for the traditional men’s elimination match pitting five-man teams from <i>Monday Night Raw</i>, <i>Friday Night SmackDown</i>, and <i>NXT</i> against each other. These plans, as suggested, might involve the in-ring return of <a href="http://inquisitr.com/tag/triple-h">Triple H</a>, who has played a key onscreen role in recent weeks as the leader of <i>NXT’s</i> invasion of <i>Raw</i> and <i>SmackDown</i>.</p>
      <p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/WrestleVotes/status/1196492945588924416">tweet</a> posted on Monday, the WrestleVotes Twitter account wrote that there have been rumors for the “past few weeks” about a “big push from creative” to have Triple H join <i>NXT’s</i> five-man men’s team at <i>Survivor Series</i> on Sunday. As further explained, this idea has drawn “mixed” reactions from people within WWE, with the 14-time former world champion reportedly not interested in stepping into the ring for the upcoming event.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://wrestlingnews.co/wwe-news/a-big-name-is-being-considered-for-in-ring-return-at-wwe-survivor-series/"><i>WrestlingNews.co</i></a> speculated that the part-time wrestler and WWE executive might have a good reason for refusing to compete at <i>Survivor Series</i> — the company’s ongoing viewership battle against All Elite Wrestling.</p>
      <p>“My guess is that some would feel that Triple H would overshadow the rest of the team at a time when the <i>NXT</i> wrestlers need to look like stars as <i>NXT</i> competes with <i>AEW Dynamite</i> every week,” wrote the outlet’s Paul Davis.</p>
      <p>At the moment, <i>NXT</i> has yet to announce the members of its teams for the traditional Survivor Series matches at the event of the same name. While <i>Raw</i> and <i>SmackDown</i> have already finalized their lineups and <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5734800/seth-rollins-survivor-series/">named their team captains</a> well ahead of the pay-per-view, only Adam Cole has been announced thus far as the men’s captain for the black-and-gold brand. The rest of the team members are expected to be confirmed on Wednesday’s episode of <i>NXT.</i></p>

      <p>Having turned 50-years-old earlier this year, Triple H remains an active wrestler for WWE despite his more prominent role as an executive vice president, usually saving his in-ring appearances for major pay-per-views such as <i>WrestleMania</i>. But if he ends up turning down the rumored chance to join <i>NXT’s</i> men’s team at <i>Survivor Series</i>, it might not be much of a surprise, as he told <i><a href="https://talksport.com/sport/wrestling/596458/triple-h-exclusive-wrestling-nxt/">talkSPORT</a></i> in a September interview that he has no plans of ever representing the black-and-gold brand as a wrestler.</p>
      <p>“Truth is, [<i>NXT</i>] is more about the youth and the next level than it is the yesterday,” Triple H said. “We’re looking forward to be progressive, not live in nostalgia.”</p>
