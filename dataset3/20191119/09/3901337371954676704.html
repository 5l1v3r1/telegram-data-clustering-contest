      <p>With speculations that Kaizer Chiefs are keeping a close eye on Ghanaian number one goalkeeper Richard Ofori, would the Maritzburg United man and his R500 000 BMW fit in at Naturena?</p>
      <p>Ofori has been the Ghanaian number one for the last couple of years, and kept a clean sheet for the Black stars when they eased past Bafana Bafana in a recent AFCON 2021 qualifier.</p>
      <p>The lanky 26-year-old has been a mainstay for Maritzburg and has been pivotal in their recent resurgence. He was also a catalyst in seeing the Team of Choice maintain their PSL status.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Off the field, the Accra-born star gets around in a flashy BMW 428i, which according to the luxury carmaker’s website, retails for a starting price of around R550 000, depending on variables.</p>
      <p>Ofori has added a personal touch to his ride with the addition of a red leather interior.</p>

      <p>Whether he will be joining the likes of Itu Khune and Daniel Akpeyi, remains to be seen, however his Beemer would fit right in with the machines at the Amakhosi village.</p>

        <b>Do you think Ofori would be a good signing for Chiefs?</b>
