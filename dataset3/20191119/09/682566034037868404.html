      <p>Cape Town - <b>Bafana Bafana</b> captain <b>Thulani Hlatshwayo</b> has revealed that national team coach <b>Molefi Ntseki</b> did not explain why <b>Buhle Mkhwanazi</b> was replaced by <b>Erick Mathoho</b>.</p>
      <p>Hlatshwayo had grown accustomed to partnering his Bidvest Wits team-mate in the heart of the Bafana Bafana defence, but fixture congestion seemed to convince Ntseki to bring in Kaizer Chiefs stalwart Mathoho for the clash with Sudan on Sunday.</p>
      <p>In the end, the decision seemed to be the correct one as South Africa kept a clean sheet and beat the Falcons of Jediane 1-0 at Orlando Stadium.</p>
      <p>"For sure, everyone is important in the team, said Hlatshwayo as quoted by</p>
      <p>"Whether I'm playing or not, or Buhle is not around; Thami is not around, as long as (the team does well).</p>
      <p>"It's a country, it's not a football club like Bidvest Wits, but we're happy for 'Tower' to have come in, even though the coach didn't really explain why he took Buhle out.</p>
      <p>"But, like I said, it's a country and everyone put their hands up (to get a place in the team)."</p>
