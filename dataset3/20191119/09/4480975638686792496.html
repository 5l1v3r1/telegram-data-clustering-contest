      <h1>Huawei plays down impact of new US license extension - Reuters</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T09:31:07+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 09:31</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/dhwani-mehta" target="_blank">Dhwani Mehta</a></address>
      <p>In response to a new 90-day license extension by the Trump Administration on Monday, the Chinese tech giant, Huawei Technologies, said that the latest extension would not “have a substantial impact on Huawei’s business either way”, as cited by Reuters.</p>
      <p>“This decision does not change the fact that Huawei continues to be treated unfairly either,” the Chinese firm added.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, China’s Foreign Ministry Spokesman Geng Shuang reiterated on Tuesday that it hopes Chinese companies will be treated fairly.</p>
      <p>Geng noted: “We urge the U.S. to stop abusing export controls to discriminate against the firms of another country in the name of national security, and to stop politicizing a trade problem.”</p>
      <p>Despite the lingering US-China trade deal uncertainty, markets are witnessing a bit of a risk reset, as indicated by a rebound in the Wall Street futures and US Treasury yields that drives USD/JPY back towards 108.80 levels. The European equities are also seen extending the opening gains.</p>
