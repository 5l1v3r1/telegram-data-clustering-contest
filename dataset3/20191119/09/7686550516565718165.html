      <h1>Man left seriously ill after buying new feather-filled duvet</h1>
      <h2>He was getting breathless just standing up to walk from room to room</h2>

      <p>A middle-aged man developed a life threatening lung condition after buying feather-filled bedding, it has been revealed.</p>
      <p>He felt so unwell, tired and breathless the simplest activities became a chore - such as going from room to room at home or walking up the stairs.</p>
      <p>Doctors have dubbed it 'feather duvet lung'.</p>
      <p>The Scot was a non-smoker - but had recently swapped a synthetic cover and pillows for feather filled bedding.</p>
      <p>After being referred to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary he was diagnosed by respiratory specialist Dr Owen Dempsey as having hypersensitivity pneumonitis.</p>
      <p>The illness sees the air sacs and airways in the lungs become severely inflamed. It's triggered by an allergic reaction to inhaled dust from feathers - and is common among bird fanciers.</p>
      <p>The married office worker began getting better - as soon as he was told to get rid of his feather duvet and pillows.</p>
      <p>He told BMJ Case Reports: "Hypersensitivity pneumonitis had a great effect on my life at the time. I started getting dizzy spells on exertion.</p>
      <p>"There was a rapid decline in my health and the lack of a diagnosis after four appointments at the GP surgery was extremely distressing.</p>
      <p>"Two months after the onset of the symptoms, I was unable to stand or walk for more than a few minutes at a time without feeling like I was going to pass out.</p>
      <p>"Going upstairs to bed was a 30 minute activity as I could only manage two stairs at a time and then needed to sit and rest."</p>
      <p>He was signed off work and spent most of the time asleep - both day and night.</p>
      <p>The man added: "I am extremely grateful to my local GP for immediately referring my case to Dr Dempsey who quickly diagnosed me with hypersensitivity pneumonitis.</p>
      <p>"I understand that it is an allergic reaction in my lungs to something breathed in.</p>
      <p>"This reaction has caused my lungs to have reduced efficiency at oxygenating my blood, causing extreme light-headedness."</p>
      <p>Dr Dempsey said his symptoms improved within the first month once he disposed of the bedding - even before starting to take steroid pills.</p>
      <p>The man was immediately advised advised to remove it from his bedroom - even before the damage to his lungs was identified in CT scans.</p>
      <p>Dr Dempsey said: "We also advised him to get his bathroom mould treated and check there were no nesting birds in his loft or chimney."</p>
      <p>After being told a possible cause of the allergy was the feather duvet and pillows he replaced them with hypoallergenic bedding.</p>
      <p>His breathing is now normal and he made a full recovery.</p>
      <p>The man added: "I have not had any dizzy turns since recovering. It doesn’t affect me at all now and my life is pretty much as it was before."</p>
      <p>Feather duvet lung (FDL) is a form of hypersensitivity pneumonitis caused by an over-reaction of immune cells.</p>
      <p>Dr Dempsey said: "FDL is caused by inhalation of organic dust from duck or goose feathers found in duvets and pillows."</p>
      <p>A study by Spanish researchers in 2013 first warned feather pillows and duvets can cause chronic and potentially fatal shortness of breath.</p>
      <p>Dr Dempsey said: "Our case reinforces the importance of taking a meticulous exposure history and asking about domestic bedding in patients with unexplained breathlessness.</p>
      <p>"Prompt recognition and cessation of antigen exposure may prevent the development of irreversible lung fibrosis (scarring)."</p>
      <p>The office worker went to his GP in November 2016 after suffering malaise, fatigue and breathlessness for three months, said Dr Dempsey.</p>
      <p>It was initially thought he had a chest infection. His respiratory symptoms got so bad he took two weeks off sick later that month.</p>
      <p>Dr Dempsey said: "He was a non-smoker, and normally well, apart from occasional sciatica and tinnitus."</p>
      <p>His blood, kidneys and liver were normal but by December he could hardly walk.</p>
      <p>Dr Dempsey said: "By now he was describing breathlessness walking between rooms at home."</p>
      <p>During a phone interview it turned out he and his wife had a cat and a dog - but no birds.</p>
      <p>Dr Dempsey added: "They had recently acquired a feather duvet and feather pillows, having formerly had synthetic bedding.</p>
      <p>"His hobbies included playing music as part of a band (guitar, saxophone) and his work was office-based with no obvious occupational exposures."</p>
      <p>The researchers pointed out this is just one case. It's not known how common feather duvet lung is. It's often missed as doctors rarely ask patients about feather bedding.</p>
      <p>But in the first four months of 2015 alone, seven million duvets were sold in the UK, they point out.</p>
      <p>And repeated exposure to the culprit trigger in hypersensitivity pneumonitis can lead to irreversible scarring of the lung tissue, so it’s important to identify this promptly, they say.</p>
