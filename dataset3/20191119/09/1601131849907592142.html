      <h1>Galaxy S8 to get Android 10 update after all?</h1>

      <p>Samsung’s customer care reps are doing it again and raising hopes that a Galaxy flagship may actually end up getting a third major Android OS upgrade. A disgruntled <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/devices/galaxy-s8/">Galaxy S8</a> owner reached out to Samsung customer care to ask why their phone will not be getting updated to Android 10 and was told that the Android 10 update is planned for the device.</p>
      <p>The customer rep did not provide any further info, and given the poor track record Samsung’s customer care has had over the years in matters like these, it’s hard to believe the Galaxy S8 and S8+ will get Android 10. Of course, it would be awesome if it did, but there’s a much higher chance of this <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/android-10-for-galaxy-s8-spotted-on-geekbench/">being a false alarm</a>. Providing the Galaxy S8 and S8+ with a third Android version upgrade would also open a can of worms for Samsung, as owners of other Galaxy devices would start demanding that they receive the Android 10 update as well.</p>
      <p>Again, it would be great if Samsung finally ends its tradition of only providing its devices with two big Android updates, especially those in the flagship segment. But we would suggest being skeptical until there’s more concrete evidence that the Galaxy S8 will get Android 10. We have reached out to Samsung on the matter and will let you know as soon as the company gets back to us.</p>
