      <p>Has Tipperary got talent?</p>
      <p>Indeed it has, and those who attended the recent variety concert in St Cronan’s Church of Ireland, Roscrea, saw and heard ample evidence of this.</p>
      <p>Wonderful foot-tapping music from Roscrea Comhaltas Ceoltoirí lifted the hearts of the large audience.</p>
      <p>Carol Thompson, the leader, noted that performers ranged in age from 7 to 77, with representation from all parts of the community. A highlight was the solo from Tadhg Maher. The Cloughjordan Community Choir, under the hand of John Armitage, featured in both parts of the programme, bringing sing-along songs from yesteryear, together with American spirituals and an amusing song about a cat and mouse!</p>
      <p>Mellow Tones, conducted by Liz Powell, warmed the hearts of people from southern Africa, with a song from their part of the world. We were reminded about the major issue of the twenty-first century, climate change, as Liz coached us to join in singing a piece on this theme.</p>
      <p>Musical offering were interspersed with dialogues from Play It By Ear, a duo who had people thinking about the meaning of Christmas.</p>
      <p>Proceeds will go to the Peter McVerry Trust and to church funds (north Tipperary circuit of the Methodist Church).</p>
