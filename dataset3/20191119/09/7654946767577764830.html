      <h1>Taliban say they freed US, Australian hostages for 3 terrorist figures</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T09:20:50+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 09:20</time> by <a rel="author">Lia Eustachewich</a></address>
      <p>Two hostages — an American and Australian — who’ve been held since 2016 have been released in a prisoner swap that let three top Taliban figures walk free, the Taliban said Tuesday.</p>
      <p>American Kevin King and Australian Timothy Weeks, both professors at the American University of Kabul, were released in the southern Zabul province.</p>
      <p>It wasn’t immediately clear if the two men were handed over to Afghan government representatives, intermediaries or US forces.</p>
      <p>King and Weeks were abducted outside the university three years ago. The following year, the Taliban released two videos of them and another in January 2017 in which they appeared pale and gaunt.</p>
      <p>Both claimed at the time that they were being treated well and asked their governments to help in their release — but it’s impossible to know whether they were forced to speak.</p>
      <p>US officials said American forces had launched a rescue mission to free the pair but they were not found at the raided location.</p>
      <p>Their release came hours after the Afghan government freed the trio of Taliban prisoners and sent them to Qatar. They included Anas Haqqani, the younger brother of the Taliban’s deputy Sirajuddin Haaqani, who leads the Aghfan guerrilla insurgent group the Haqqani network.</p>
      <p>It appears the Taliban had refused to hand over King and Weeks until they received proof their own men had reached Qatar.</p>
      <p>The “conditional release” of the Taliban figures <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/12/us-professor-kevin-king-to-be-freed-in-prisoner-swap-between-afghanistan-and-taliban/">was announced last week</a> by Afghan President Ashraf Ghani.</p>
      <p>The prisoner exchange was intended to try to restart talks to end Afghanistan’s 18-year war and allow for the eventual withdrawal of US troops from the country.</p>
