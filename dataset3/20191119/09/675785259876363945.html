      <h1>Steve McManaman lifts the lid on Raheem Sterling and Joe Gomez row</h1>
      <h2>Man City winger Raheem Sterling and Liverpool defender Joe Gomez were involved in an altercation while on England duty last week</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T09:50:46+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 09:50</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Smith</a></address>
      <p>Steve McManaman has revealed that the atmosphere in the England team hotel was "relaxed" after Joe Gomez and Raheem Sterling's bust-up.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> winger Sterling lost his temper with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> defender Joe Gomez last Monday as the pair teamed up with the Three Lions the day after they had gone head-to-head in a crunch Premier League match.</p>
      <p>Sterling allegedly attempted to grab Gomez's throat before England players intervened.</p>
      <p>Sterling was prevented from playing in the Euro 2020 qualifier against Montenegro, although return in Kosovo, while Gomez sported a scratch under his eye in training the next day.</p>

      <p>But Liverpool and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> legend McManaman, who was in the vicinity when it happened, thinks the altercation was blown out of proportion and that type of incident occurs regularly in football dressing rooms.</p>
      <p>“To be honest, there are always clashes in training - when you live and play football every single day, there’s always heated incidents on the training ground," McManaman told <a href="http://horseracing.net/">Horseracing.net.</a></p>
      <p>“When the intensity is high and people are playing for places, you may get away with a tackle or a pull of the shirt and people get frustrated, it happens all the time.</p>

      <p>“To me it was nothing; it was over in 10 seconds, both the players were fine and I was actually there on the day it happened at the hotel and it was quite relaxed afterwards.”</p>
      <p>Gomez was booed by England fans at Wembley against Montenegro - and McManaman was unhappy with the response to the innocent party and thinks Jurgen Klopp should start him for the Reds against <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> at the weekend.</p>
      <p>The ex-midfielder said: “I thought it was absolutely ridiculous what happened with Joe Gomez being booed at Wembley, but that is just part of what happens when a story gets out - people start taking one side or the other.</p>
      <p>"In the world we live in now, it’s physically impossible to keep anything quiet anymore, and I think that’s the sad thing about it.</p>
      <p>I don’t think Jurgen Klopp necessarily has to give him any backing by starting him against Crystal Palace on Saturday. I think if everyone is fit, he will probably go with the team that beat Manchester City, and if Joe plays it will be because he is a fantastic player - that’s all.”</p>
