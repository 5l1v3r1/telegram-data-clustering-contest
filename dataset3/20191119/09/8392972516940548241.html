      <h1>Coronation Street SPOILERS: Hope’s behaviour pushes Fiz and Tyrone to breaking point</h1>
      <h2>Is firestarter Hope up to her old tricks?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T09:53:17+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 09:53</time> by <a rel="author">Claire Crick</a></address>
      <p>Next week's <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/">Coronation Street</a> sees parents Fiz Stape and Tyrone Dobbs terrified that Hope Stape's pyromania is getting out of control when she apparently sets yet another blaze on the cobbles.</p>
      <p>But is all as it seems?</p>
      <p>Hope has been giving Tyrone and Fiz sleepless nights for months over her behaviour, but instead of her getting better after attending a specialist school in Birmingham, it seems she is just getting worse when ANOTHER fire breaks out next week.</p>

      <p>When Hope asks for a fireworks party, Fiz refuses and is worried that her daughter's love of all things flammable is getting out of hand.</p>

      <p>But while Tyrone is also worried that Hope is up to her old tricks, he suggests they let her have the party that she's asked for to keep her happy.</p>
      <p>As the party gets under way, the pair soon live to regret their decision when they realise the back garden is on fire and Hope is standing nearby watching the flames with amusement.</p>

      <p>Fiz and Tyrone are horrified to realise that Hope must have started the fire herself, but when Jack admits that the fire had already started when he and Hope entered the back year, things don't seem to add up.</p>
      <p>Who really started the fire? Was it Hope? Or could <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-street-who-is-jade-top-5-theories-entertainment-daily/">sinister Jade</a> have something to do with it? Later in the week she definitely seems to be enjoying the fall out...</p>
      <p>With all the evidence pointing to Hope being the arsonist as far as Fiz is concerned, she admits to Tyrone that she thinks Hope was responsible for the factory fire as well.</p>
      <p>Tyrone is shocked when Fiz tearfully admits that she has been thinking the worst about Hope for weeks but she was worried he would leave her if she admitted the truth.</p>
      <p>Thankfully the pair make up and take a united stand against the little girl.</p>

      <p>As the pair decide they need to be tougher with Hope, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-street-fans-fear-jade-is-killer-john-stapes-sister/">troublemaker Jade</a> is busy stirring up drama by suggesting to Evelyn that Fiz's parenting skills aren't up to scratch.</p>
      <p>And her point seems to be confirmed when later Fiz finds a lighter hidden in Hope's doll and Fiz smashes Hope's iPad in a fit of rage.</p>

      </p>
      <p>But there seems to be a light at the end of the tunnel for Fiz and Tyrone when they get a letter from Hope's old school telling them that they have got a space for their daughter and Hope can return.</p>

      <p>But of course, Hope going back to her old school means the family no longer need Jade around the house to help, and Fiz is forced to break the news to their live-in tutor that her services are no longer required.</p>
      <p>But how will Jade take it? Will she happily leave the family to fend for themselves, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-streets-tyrone-fiz-and-evelyn-film-mystery-court-scenes/">or does she have something much more sinister up her sleeve?</a></p>
      <p>Is she actually the one behind Hope's pyromania - and is she using it to her advantage?</p>
