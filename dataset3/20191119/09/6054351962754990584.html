      <h1>50 Cent Denies Bullying 'Power' Co-Star Naturi Naughton</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T09:37:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 09:37</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://hiphopdx.com/author/Kyle%20Eustice" target="_blank">Kyle Eustice</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53351/title.50-cent-gets-political-with-nancy-pelosi-on-capitol-hill">50 Cent</a> is denying reports he bullied his <i>Power</i> co-star <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.49564/title.50-cent-power-cast-mourn-death-of-crew-member">Naturi Naughton.</a></p>
      <p>The infamous Instagram troll, whose account is currently deactivated, recently found himself on the defense after he posted a meme comparing Naughton to <i>Mortal Kombat</i> character Goro.</p>
      <p>But according to a recent tweet, he was actually attempting to stand up for her.</p>
      <p>After a fan tweeted, “I thought u was sticking up for her or did I read wrong,” he replied, “I was sticking up for her, they just went and made some shit up.”</p>

      <p>The <i>Power</i> mastermind wasn’t so kind to another Twitter user who said, “Good BYE!!! Dont go back until you got some manners.”</p>
      <p>Fiddy replied, “Shut up bitch.”</p>

      <p>Naughton, who quickly caught wind of 50’s shenanigans, was prepared for battle and <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53495/title.naturi-naughton-clap-backs-at-50-cents-mortal-kombat-meme">called him out</a> for being a shady boss.</p>
      <p>“There’s so much I wanna say,” she wrote on Instagram. “but…. You don’t even have an Instagram account so… why waste my characters or come out of my CHARACTER!But do pick up a copy of my upcoming book: #whatNOTtoDoWhenYoureABoss ‍‍#ImNotACharacter #IAmARealPerson #IAmAWoman #IAmABlackWoman.”</p>

      <p>This wasn’t the first time <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53401/title.50-cent-tank-spark-instagram-debate-over-male-oral-sex-laws">Fiddy</a> appeared to make fun of Naughton’s appearance. Earlier this month, he posted another meme targeting the actress.</p>
      <p>“POWER never ends, Ghost fucked up the edges LOL,” he captioned a photo of Naughton next to <i>Power</i>’s Omari Hardwick pushing Naughton’s forehead on the other.</p>
      <p>He ultimately apologized after Naughton said he was “mean” on her Instagram Stories.</p>
      <p>“yes you do a great job on the show @naturi4real,” he wrote in a since-deleted post. “I’m sorry if I hurt your feelings #lecheminduroi #bransoncognac.”</p>
      <p>The rap vet’s Instagram account was deactivated shortly after his spar with Naughton, but he says he <a href="https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.53463/title.50-cent-tweets-absolute-randomness-after-instagram-account-gets-shut-down">did that himself.</a> He can currently be found on Twitter.</p>
