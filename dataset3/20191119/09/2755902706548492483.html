      <p>The Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) have revealed that they are hunting for a male suspect who dumped his lover at a city lodge after being intimate with her.</p>
      <p>According to the police, the suspect duped the woman into having sexual intercourse with him after lying that the lodge was his parents’ house. Apparently, the suspect had told the woman that he was going to introduce her to his parents.</p>
      <p>After the couple finished being intimate, the suspect then dumped the woman at the lodge after claiming that he was only stepping out for a few minutes. He never returned.</p>
      <p>The police’s statement is rather confusing because they claim that the suspect ” became intimate with her” and they do not say that he raped the complainant or sexually molested her. Since the woman, in this case, is 18 years old, it begs the question of what charge the police will prefer aginst the suspect when they apprehend him as they have indicated.</p>
      <p>Below is the statement shared by the police on their <a href="https://twitter.com/PoliceZimbabwe/status/1196465786426146819">official social media page on Twitter</a>,</p>
      <aside>An 18-year-old woman was lured to a lodge in Harare by a prospective boyfriend on the pretext that he wanted to introduce her to his parents. He lied to her that the premise was his parents’house and became intimate with her.<br/>He later left complainant at the lodge, promising to come back the following morning but went away for good. Young women should not be lured to private places unaccompanied by either close friends or relatives by suitors especially those known over a short period.<br/>Police are looking for the suspect. #notowomenabuse</aside>

      <p>Responding to the police’s statement, most social media users seem to be confused by how the matter becomes a police matter.  Given the information shared by the police themselves, people are arguing that this seems to be a case of a lovers’ tiff or more extremely a case of “kutsotswa stonyeni” in the local parlance.  Others also accused the police of using the wrong words in their statement which make it appear as if the intimacy was consensual when it might actually have been forced.</p>
