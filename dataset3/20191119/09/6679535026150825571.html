      <h1>Kannada writer-director SA Harish on his film 'Raga Bhairavi'</h1>
      <h2>After two decades of experience in TV serials, the writer brings a film about a Hindustani vocal singer diagnosed with throat cancer</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T09:11:42+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 09:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Shilpa-Sebastian-R-7311/" target="_blank">Shilpa Sebastian R</a></address>
      <p>SA Harish found it easy to express himself through the written word. It was natural for the man to take to writing. This led him to become a script writer for the many television serials, and today the man has a two decade experience in writing scripts. He has written for many serials, including popular ones such as <i>Janani </i>and <i>Chitralekha. </i>He is currently writing the script for the mega serial <i>Muddu Lakshmi, </i>which is telecast on Star Suvarna Channel.</p>

      <p>Besides writing, Harish also is passionate about Hindustani classical music. He decided to blend his passions to make a film. The result is the Kannada film <i>Raga Bhairavi.</i></p>
      <p>Harish is on cloud nine as the film was screened at the 25th Kolkata International Film festival, recently. “We plan to have a few screenings in Bengaluru and then look for a theatrical release. The film is about a Hindustani vocal singer, who is diagnosed with throat cancer. How she copes and relying on her music for strength during her illness forms the crux of the film,” explains Harish, who has also written the story for the film.</p>
      <p>“It is believed that Bhairavi raga is said to have healing powers. It has been scientifically proved too,” says Harish, who has also written the lyrics for a few songs in Kannada films such as <i>Maya Bazaar, Central Jail, Rough and Tough </i>and <i>Jackie Chan</i>.</p>

      <p>According to Harish, writing a script for a film and a serial have their own challenges.</p>
      <p>“Serials need to be stretched over a certain period of time and that is where the challenge comes in. We have to tell the story in such a manner that the viewer is eager to return to it. This, in a way, gives you ample opportunity to explore your skills as a writer. In cinema, on the other hand, the story has to be said within a certain amount of time. How we pack in the characters and incidents is a challenge,” explains Harish.</p>
      <p>The writer/director says he loves television as, “this is my profession and provides my bread and butter; while cinema is my passion.”</p>
