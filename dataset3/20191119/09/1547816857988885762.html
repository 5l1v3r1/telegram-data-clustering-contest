        <b>A few minutes back, trailer of Ajay Devgn, Saif Ali Khan and Kajol starrer, Tanahaji hit the Internet. The stars are currently at the launch event and we are bringing to you all the LIVE updates from ground zero</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ajay Devgn and Saif Ali Khan are returning to the silver screen after a long gap, the last we saw them together was in Omkara (2003). Also, it is Ajay’s 100th film and this one is even special because it has his wife, Kajol in it. However, at the trailer launch, we saw that the beautiful actress was missing.</p>
      <p>Of course, we asked Ajay why Kajol didn’t make it to the event. The actor replied, “Kajol had to be in Singapore as either one of the parents had to attend Nysa’s parent-teacher meet.”   </p>

      <p>Looks like it’s Parent duty calls for Kajol. Talking about the event, we also brought to you a story where Saif and Ajay had a fun banter with each other on their perfection. When Saif said that he also took 25 takes to perfect few shots, Ajay interrupted and said that Saif was retaking only for his satisfaction, otherwise in the film his first take has only made way.</p>
