      <p>Nadine Coyle has only been in the jungle for a night, but she’s already gaining fans on I’m A Celebrity… Get Me Out Of Here!</p>

      <p>She’s made friends with Caitlyn Jenner, faced one of her major fears – skydiving – and looks all set to do well on the show.</p>
      <p>Coyle was discovered by Louis Walsh on the Irish version of the reality TV show Popstars, and in 2002 formed girl group Girls Aloud with Cheryl, Sarah Harding, Nicola Roberts and Kimberley Walsh.</p>

      <p>The 34-year-old will be wearing the jungle uniform of khaki shirts and wide-brimmed hats, meaning she won’t be able to give us a taste of her characteristically girl band style.</p>
      <p>However, this is how her fashion choices have evolved since she came into the public eye in the early Noughties…</p>

      <p>Most of Coyle’s outfits from the beginning of her career are a time capsule for some seriously dodgy Noughties trends. Take low-rise jeans, which she often paired with belts that were more decorative than functional.</p>

      <p>Denim miniskirts – a Coyle favourite – could be dressed up or down. Here, Coyle opted for a flashier outfit with silver pumps and a babydoll-style top.</p>

      <p>In all honesty, this outfit wouldn’t look too out of place today; baker boy hats have had a resurgence thanks to high fashion houses like Dior.</p>

      <p>Who among us wasn’t overly liberal with fake tan in 2007? Coyle once again proved her Noughties credentials with the addition of a totally irrelevant belt over her dress.</p>

      <p>Adhering to the tried and tested girl band outfit rule – same colour, different shape – in 2007 this saw Coyle don a satin purple number with a handkerchief hem.</p>

      <p>As we got into the 2010s, Coyle began paring back her style, but was still very much on-trend. This is the kind of white dress we’d have loved to wear ‘out out’ in 2012.</p>

      <p>Nowadays, Coyle is much more of a classic dresser, wearing monochromatic outfits and opting for a sleeker vibe.</p>

      <p>Staying true to her roots, Coyle wears for sparkles whenever possible – something we’re sure she’ll miss in the jungle.</p>

      <p>This matchy-matchy pink suit – a very popular look on Instagram – may look ace, but wouldn’t fare too well in a Bushtucker Trial either…</p>
