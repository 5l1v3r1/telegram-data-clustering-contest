      <h3>Fuse Audio Labs’ W2395c is a free Baxandall EQ plugin with a modern twist</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Fuse Audio Labs is marrying classic ‘50s hardware with 2019 technology in W2395c, a free Baxandall EQ plugin. This adds a mid band to the standard low and high ones.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Designed to make your tracks “stand out big time”, W2395c promises midrange control alongside bass and treble shaping, and all from a very simple interface. The low and high bands are switchable (between 80 and 110Hz and 2 and 5kHz respectively), and you can choose from three different Q factors for the mids.</p>
      <p>Designed to be used across the board - on vocals, drums, guitars, synths and your mix bus - you can download W2395c now from the <a href="https://fuseaudiolabs.com/#/pages/product?id=300965965"><u>Fuse Audio Labs</u></a> website. It runs on PC and Mac in VST/AU/AAX formats.</p>
