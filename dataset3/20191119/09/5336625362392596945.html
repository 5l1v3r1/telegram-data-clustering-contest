      <p>All good things must come to an end. Even Kylo Ren's tenure in <i>Star Wars.</i></p>
      <p><i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker </i>is supposed to be the final film in the Skywalker Saga. So, how does it feel to "hang up your lightsaber," Stephen Colbert asked Adam Driver, who plays resident troubled baddie Kylo Ren. </p>
      <p>"Good," he said. "I also have it. I literally hung it up. It's in a box."</p>
      <p>Apparently he also took home a costume with him – although he made sure to get permission from J.J. Abrams first. "I asked 'cause they'll hunt you down, Disney," he explained.</p>
      <p>Next, Colbert asked the question many of <a href="https://mashable.com/2017/12/20/last-jedi-kylo-ren-crush/">us Kylo crushers</a> have been longing to have answered: What would Kylo be like in a marriage? </p>
      <p>"Understanding, gentle, and tall," came the reply.</p>
