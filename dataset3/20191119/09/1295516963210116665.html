      <p>As the midseason finale for <i>The Walking Dead</i> Season 10 approaches, the latest episode ended with the <a href="https://www.cbr.com/the-walking-dead-whisperer-spy-dante/">bombshell revelation</a> that the medical specialist Dante was actually a spy planted by the Whisperers. As Siddiq realized his friend was secretly destabilizing the community, Dante strangled him to death to maintain his secret in a shocking twist.</p>
      <p>Showrunner Angela Kang explained the twist ending to Season 10's sixth episode, noting that Siddiq's unreliable memory would be exploited while the season's long-simmering conflict between the Whisperers and Alexandria would have paranoia and distrust appear prevalently.</p>

      <p>"We were like, 'Well, people just tend to trust doctors. They just do. And it’s something they need, and it connects to Siddiq,'" Kang observed in an interview with <a href="https://ew.com/tv/2019/11/17/walking-dead-open-your-eyes-siddiq-dante/">Entertainment Weekly</a>. "And we were wanting to introduce Dante as a character, and we just decided to meld them together and see if we could play a story where like, 'Here’s this person who, on the one hand, is incredibly charming and could be a friend and he legitimately actually likes Siddiq, but he’s also got a deeper agenda.'"</p>
      <p>The tension between the surviving factions from outside and within has risen over the course of the season. Meanwhile, Dante has used his access as a medical professional to gain access to the water and damage the community's water filters to contaminate the supply.</p>

      <p>"He’s been sabotaging water," Kang confirmed. "He’s been doing some little things about the community to poke and prod at their problems, and we’ll find out a bit more about that in the next episode as well."</p>
