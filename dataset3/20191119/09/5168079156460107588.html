      <p><b>Muscat:</b> To express their joy for National Day or other happy occassions, some drivers play songs at full volume or use the car horn when not required. Others drift in their cars and disturb public order.<br/><br/><a href="https://timesofoman.com/article/2244800/TimesTV/Oman/Videos/Watch-Joyful-people-on-the-streets"><u><b>Watch: Joyful people on the streets</b></u></a><br/><br/>The Royal Oman Police (ROP) said in a statement, "Drifting, annoying others and undesirable behaviour that do not take into account the public comfort reflect the uncivilized expressions of Omanis.”<br/><br/>“The manifestations of expressing the joy of the country are a reflection of your principles and ethics. Be an ambassador to your country with your civilised behavior, and do not disturb the joy of others with unwanted actions," the ROP added.</p>
