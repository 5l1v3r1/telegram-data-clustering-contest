      <p>A Linux developer in the Netherlands first spotted troubles with Disney+ and after little digging, <a href="https://tweakers.net/nieuws/157224/disney+-start-met-gratis-proefperiode-van-twee-maanden-in-nederland.html?showReaction=13428408#r_13428408">tech site Tweakers</a> realised it was due to the streaming service's use of WideVine, digital rights management service. Essentially, in order to protect the copyright of Disney's content, it allegedly utilises the highest level of protection and if a device doesn't run that level of WideVine, it won't be able to play content from Disney+.</p>
