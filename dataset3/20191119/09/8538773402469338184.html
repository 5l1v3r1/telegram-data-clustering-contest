      <p>Mauricio Pochettino has held talks with Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy to discuss his increasing frustrations at the state of the squad, sources have told ESPN FC.</p>
      <p>Spurs sit in 14th in the Premier League, having won just three of their 13 League games so far this season, and a defeat at West Ham on Saturday would see Pochettino's team drop below their London rivals and intensify the pressure on the Argentine to turn the situation around.</p>

      <p>Sources have told ESPN FC, however, that Pochettino believes the club are now paying the price for a failure to reshape his squad during the summer and his discussions with Levy during the international break focused on his grievances.</p>
      <p>After guiding Tottenham to their first Champions League final -- Spurs lost to Liverpool in Madrid -- Pochettino was determined to make a number of changes this summer, with <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/104991/Danny-Rose">Danny Rose</a> and <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/111306/Toby-Alderweireld">Toby Alderweireld</a> regarded as surplus to requirements.</p>
      <p>Both players remain at the club, though, and midfielder <a href="http://espnfc.com/player/_/id/144130/Christian-Eriksen">Christian Eriksen</a>'s future continues to be unresolved as the Denmark international heads towards the final six months of his contract.</p>
      <p>Sources have told ESPN FC that a number of senior players have become frustrated by Pochettino's discontent and the manager's negative comments in the media at times this season.</p>
      <p>Pochettino also raised eyebrows within the dressing room when he said during preseason that he would have quit Spurs had they beaten Liverpool in the Champions League final.</p>
      <p>While this weekend's trip to West Ham is not regarded as a "must-win" for Pochettino in terms of his future at the club, sources have told ESPN FC that the manner of the performance and result could yet prove significant.</p>
