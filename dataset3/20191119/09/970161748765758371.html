      <p>A woman has spoken publicly for the first time about being abused by billionaire sex offender Jeffrey Epstein when she was just 15.</p>
      <p>The woman, who has been identified only as ‘Jane Doe 15’, told reporters in the US she suffered a ‘vicious, prolonged sexual assault’.</p>
      <p>She called on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-andrew-duke-of-york/">Prince Andrew</a> to speak to US law officials to share information on his former friend in light of the interview he gave this weekend to the BBC.</p>
      <p>The accuser, now 31, has not made any allegations against the Duke of York directly, but said he and ‘any others who are close to Epstein’ should come forward and ‘give a statement under oath on what information they have’.</p>
      <p>The unnamed woman spoke at a news conference in Los Angeles alongside lawyer Gloria Allred, who represents a number of the alleged victims of disgraced financier Epstein.</p>

      <p>Ms Allred also said she had called on Prince Andrew to ‘voluntarily meet with the FBI and prosecutors who are investigating this criminal case in New York, and also to provide his deposition under oath’.</p>

      <p>She told reporters: ‘I don’t think Prince Andrew should wait for a gold-engraved invitation to speak with law enforcement.</p>
      <p>‘He should get on a flight as soon as possible and make this happen.’</p>
      <p>She later told Sky News: ‘Given that he was in so many of the homes and locations Mr Epstein was in, he does have valuable information that he could provide to law enforcement.</p>
      <p>‘No one – prince or pauper – should refuse to or decline to provide that information that may be relevant to a criminal case.</p>

      <p>In his interview with Newsnight, which aired on Saturday night, Prince Andrew was pressed on his friendship with Epstein, and an accusation made by Virginia Giuffre that he had sex with her at Epstein’s house when she was 17.</p>
      <p>Prince Andrew denied having sex with Ms Giuffre, but the interview created a wave of criticism directed at the royal.</p>
