      <h1>Per Mertesacker picks four ex-Arsenal players in his perfect XI but leaves out Mesut Ozil</h1>
      <h2>The former Arsenal defender was asked to name his dream line-up</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T09:30:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 09:30</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Ha</a></address>
      <p>Per Mertesacker was asked to pick his all-time XI but could not find room for former Arsenal and Germany teammate Mesut Ozil.</p>
      <p>The ex-Arsenal defender, who is now the Gunners' academy director, selected Laurent Koscienly, Santi Cazorla, Tomas Rosicky and Mikel Arteta in his starting line-up, but Ozil had to settle for a place on the bench.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.fourfourtwo.com/">FourFourTwo</a>, he explained why he selected Koscielny in the back four. The pair forged a solid partnership during their time at the Emirates, and Mertesacker urged fans to forgive the Frenchman after his acrimonious exit to Bordeaux in the summer.</p>
      <p>"We formed the best partnership of my career," he said.</p>
      <p>"Laurent complimented my game and I loved our time together. It was sad to see him leave Arsenal the way he did, because he deserved a better legacy.</p>
      <p>"All of the fans will soon appreciate him and everything he did for the club, because there are always two sides to a story."</p>
      <p>Mertesacker also named Rosicky in his midfield, saying: "A special footballer and a fantastic guy. One of my first games was against him when he was at Borussia Dortmund. He was tough to stop, so I was really glad to have him as a team-mate at Arsenal."</p>
      <p>On Cazorla, he added: "One hell of a footballer - in training it was ridiculous! It's sad when a naturally gifted player struggles with injury. Santi didn't look like an athlete and wasn't fast, but he could do everything."</p>
      <p>There was special praise reserved for Arteta, with Mertesacker <a href="https://www.football.london/arsenal-fc/news/per-mertesacker-mikel-arteta-arsenal-17278624">revealing he would love to work</a> with the Spaniard again in the future.</p>
      <p>"I was his vice-captain at Arsenal and he trusted me. I was by his side during team meetings and we had a great bond. Iâ€™d love to work with him again, a top guy."</p>
      <p><b>Per Mertesacker's XI</b> : Robert Enke, Clemens Fritz, Naldo, Laurent Koscielny, Philipp Lahm, Tomas Rosicky, Michael Ballack, Mikel Arteta, Santi Cazorla, Miroslav Klose, Claudio Pizarro.</p>
      <p>Bench: Torsten Frings, Mesut Ozil, Lukas Podolski.</p>
