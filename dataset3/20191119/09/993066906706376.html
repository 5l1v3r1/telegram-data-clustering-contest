      <p>IRISH eyes will be on Cardiff tonight as the outcome of Wales versus Hungary will have an impact on the play-off fates of both teams from this island.</p>
      <p>A Welsh win would confirm the following pairings next March: Republic of Ireland away to Slovakia and Northern Ireland travelling to take on Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina.</p>
      <p>However, if Wales don’t win they would be potential opponents for Mick McCarthy’s men (but not NI).</p>
      <p>There is no longer an ‘all-Ireland’ group scenario at the Euros now as that could only have occurred if Mick McCarthy’s men had qualified automatically by beating Denmark in Dublin last night.</p>
      <p>Now, though, the two Irish sides could meet in the Path B play-off final - but obviously<u> only one of them</u> can progress to the Euros.</p>
      <p>If Hungary win to qualify automatically, at the expense of both Wales and Slovakia, that would increase the chances of Michael O’Neill’s team having a home match - in Path A of next year’s Euro 2020 play-offs. NI, Wales, and Slovakia would all be in the draw to be elevated into the Path A play-off.</p>
      <p>However, if NI remain in Path B, and win it, they would have at least one Euro match close to home, in Dublin, as the Path B winners will go into Group E, along with Spain – and potentially the Republic of Ireland.</p>
      <p>If the Republic of Ireland do qualify they will have home advantage for two group games but would meet Spain in Bilbao in the other one.</p>
      <p>If Northern Ireland were to come through the Path B play-off they would also have two group matches in Dublin but have to play the Spanish in their home base of Bilbao.</p>
      <p>A Hungarian victory in Cardiff this evening would send both the Welsh and the Slovakians into the play-offs, joining Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, Northern Ireland, and the Republic of Ireland.</p>
      <p>With five teams from League B of the Nations League (remember it?) one of them would have to be elevated into Path A of the play-offs.</p>
      <p>Given that Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina topped their Nations League group, they are guaranteed a home draw in the play-off semi-finals, so would remain in Path B, meaning Friday’s draw would decide which of NI, Slovakia, or Wales would go up into Path A.</p>
      <p>As the Republic of Ireland are Euro 2020 hosts, they will remain in Path B to ensure there is one (potential) host in that path.</p>
      <p>If Northern Ireland are drawn into Path A, they would meet one of Bulgaria, Israel, or Romania. The Romanians will definitely go into Path A because Bucharest is one of the host cities of Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>Looking slightly further ahead, winning the Path A play-offs would pit NI against familiar opponents at the Euros, with the team progressing from that route going into group C against the Netherlands, Ukraine, and one other. Those group C games would take place in Amsterdam and Bucharest.</p>
      <p>If Northern Ireland remain in Path B and qualify that way, they would be in the same Euros group as Spain, with a draw to decide the other two opponents.</p>
