      <h1>Instagram curated 2019’s biggest trends with new shoppable collections</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T09:48:03+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 09:48</time> by <a rel="author">Shereesa Moodley</a></address>
      <p>Instagram on Monday revealed a new range of shopping collections themed after 2019’s biggest trends on the platform.</p>
      <p>Featuring hashtags such as #newparents and #makeupqueens, the collections allow users to browse and buy this year’s most popular products directly from Instagram.</p>
      <p>“You can also save products to a personal shopping collection while browsing for friends and family, or create your own wishlist,” the company said on its <a href="https://instagram-press.com/blog/2019/11/18/shop-with-your-heart-on-instagram/">blog</a>.</p>
      <p>Just in time for the festive season, the collections come after Instagram launched a series of in-app shopping features earlier this year, including the <a href="https://memeburn.com/2019/03/instagram-checkout-retail-feature/">Checkout feature</a> and <a href="https://memeburn.com/2019/05/instagram-launches-new-shop-account-to-promote-emerging-brands/">@shop account</a>.</p>
      <p>Together with expecting parents and beauty fanatics, Instagram’s shopping collections also cater for this year’s #partylewk, #altenergy and #wonderlust trends.</p>
