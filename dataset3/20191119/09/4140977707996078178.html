          </p>
          <p>For both Delhi Bulls and Northern Warriors, the group stage encounters of the T10 League couldn’t have transpired in any more inclement manner. Both sides were in a howler of a touch across their three matches with the two managing to muster up just the two wins in the six matches they played in between them.</p>
          <p>Sitting in third place of Group A, for Delhi Bulls, their first season ever in the marquee league hasn’t quite gone according to the side’s gameplan. The team endured a mixed bag of results, one which saw them win, draw and lose in their three matches to finish with three points with their culminating group stage fixture seeing them indulge in what was only the second draw till now this season.</p>

                <p>Elsewhere, for Northern Warriors, the predicament has been even more flabbergasting with the side finding themselves slumped into bottom place in Group A with just the sole win from two matches. The side make ad advent into the Super League having been clinically dismantled and decimated in their previous outing, one which saw them suffer a contentious 6 wicket defeat after managing to squirm their way to a mere 92 while batting first.</p>
                <h3>Pitch Conditions And Toss</h3>
                <p>Every pitch report which we’ve brought forward this league has been the same with the ground team working extremely well to ensure that the league has been able to provide the kind of entertainment it promised. Completely hard and brown to be devoid of anything in it for the bowlers, this wicket is going to be batting conducive with the side winning the toss set to come out and chase today given the fact that this is an evening affair.</p>

                            <h3>DEB Vs NOR Dream11  Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>Needing just 18 balls to smash his way to 43 runs yesterday, Delhi Bulls’ wicket-keeper, Kusal Perera is the first player we are ingraining in our Dream 11 setup for this encounter. Elsewhere, Sam Billings comes in as well from the other side of the slot with the opposition’s wicket-keeper and opener laying down a foundation for them with his 35 runs in the side’s last match. </p>
                            <h3>DEB Vs NOR Dream11 Batsmen</h3>
                            <p>Lendl Simmons hasn’t played till now for Northern Warriors but with the player having ended his soiree with West Indies, he should be inducted straightaway into his team’s batting unit for this encounter to come into our side as well. From Delhi Bulls elsewhere we are beginning with their captain Eoin Morgan with his 27 runs in the last encounter taking his tally upto 100 runs in 3 matches for the side.</p>
                            <p>He will find company in Angelo Matthews, someone who looked good during his knock of 17 in the same match before he was eventually run out to curb his promising knock. </p>
                            <h3>DEB Vs NOR Dream11 All-Rounders</h3>
                            <p>His 96 runs in three matches include a 50 in the side’s only win in the league till now along with 37 runs in the foregone contest with the three wickets to come along as well, making Andre Russell an instant pick for us for this encounter. The player is accompanied by Chris Green who has accumulated the three wickets in three matches to emerge as the leading wicket taker for the side.</p>
                            <p>From Delhi we are opting for Mohammad Nabi with player snaring 2-18 in his first match for the side yesterday, seeing his slower variety of bowling repay rewards for both him and the side.</p>
                            <h3>DEB Vs NOR Dream11 Bowling Order</h3>
                            <p>The 1-17 in the same encounter see Dushmantha Chameera accompany him for the day whilst from Northern Warriors we have decided to divulge in the picks of an indomitable and deadly duo in the form of Rayad Emrit and Chris Wood. Rayad Emrit in particular has emerged as an integral figure for the side in their bowling sojourns given his restrictive brand of bowling and deviation and will be looking to make early headway into Delhi’s heavy batting unit.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>We are choosing Billings as our captain for the day whilst Russell comes in as the vice-captain.</p>
