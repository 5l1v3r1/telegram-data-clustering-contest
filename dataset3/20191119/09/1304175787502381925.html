      <p><b>Moscow Domodedovo Airport</b> participated in the Business Breakfast: Transformation in the Commercial Real Estate Market. The Results of a Decade of Development. The Civic Chamber of the Russian Federation hosted the event. Moscow Aerotropolis Development Director Alexey Ulitin made a presentation entitled “<i>Moscow Aerotropolis is a New Ecosystem for Business</i>.”</p>
      <p>Moscow Aerotropolis is an airport city that relies on the commercial development of airport territories. Within a 20 km radius of the air hub, Moscow Domodedovo will work on a project, divided into different clusters. The first phase aims at developing six clusters, including exhibition, business, industrial, agricultural, commercial, and recreational, as well as an airport city.</p>
      <p>“<i>Our cluster-based development strategy stems from the successful cases of aerotropolis development around the globe. The several commercial real estate projects will be implemented in Moscow Aerotropolis, including offices, storages, hotels, apartments as well as infrastructure for retail, recreation, and entertainment</i>,” said <b>Alexey Ulitin</b>.</p>
      <p>He presented the first Moscow Aerotropolis projects launched this year. For instance, Granelle Group, in partnership with InterContinental Hotels Group, is building a hotel complex of 35 thousand square meters.<br/>The project comprises 5-star Crown Plaza Hotel and 3-star Holiday Inn Express. The 450-room hotel complex and the terminal building will be joined by a skyway.</p>
      <p>During the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum 2019, an agreement was signed to build the Holiday Inn hotel.</p>
      <p>The Holiday Inn Hotel will become a part of a 20 hectares multifunctional complex, comprising a shopping mall, car parks, and motorway service facilities. InterContinental Hotels Group will manage a 148 room Holiday Inn.</p>
