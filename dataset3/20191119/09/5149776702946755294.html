      <h2>Notts are in need of bowling reinforcements after losing Luke Wood and Paul Coughlin</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T09:46:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 09:46</time> by <a rel="author">Matt Davies</a></address>
      <p>Nottinghamshire are reportedly set to sign Pakstan seamer Mohammad Abbas after two seasons with Leicestershire.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.wisden.com/stories/county-cricket/exclusive-nottinghamshire-set-to-sign-pakistan-seamer-mohammad-abbas">Wisden</a> say Abbas will join <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottinghamshire-ccc">Notts </a>imminently and while the club confirm he is on their shortlist of overseas options to play in the County Championship in in 2020, they did not confirm the deal is done.</p>
      <p>James Pattinson remains an alternative after with the Australia international having spent two stints at Trent Bridge, where he is hugely popular and respected in the dressing room.</p>
      <p>Abbas has taken 79 wickets at an average of just 20.67 for Leicestershire, including ten wickets in a day against Durham.</p>
      <p>The 29-year-old also has 66 wickets from 14 Test appearances at an impressive average of 18.86.</p>
      <p>Notts are in need of additional bowling options following the departures of Luke Wood and Paul Coughlin, which left them with Jake Ball, who struggled for form last year, Luke Fletcher and Zak Chappel as the only senior seam options.</p>
      <p>Chappell has a poor injury record and while Notts have sporadic appearances from Stuart Broad and promising pace options like Jack Blatherwick, a new addition is needed.</p>
