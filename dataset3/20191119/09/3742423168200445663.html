      <h1>Who Makes The Best Breakfast In Your City?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T09:30:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 09:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lifehacker.com.au/author/nick-douglas" target="_blank">Nick Douglas</a></address>
      <p>Most cities have a handful of cafes and restaurants that are renowned for making delicious lunches and dinners. Breakfast, on the other hand, tends to be a lot less publicised.</p>
      <p>If you had to pick one spot (OK, maybe two or three) to take a friend to breakfast, what would it be? And why?</p>
      <p>Dottie’s True Blue Café in San Francisco fed me the first home fries that I actually enjoyed—the first home fries that weren’t just filler to top off my stomach after I’d finished the real food. That’s why there’s a line around the corner, and why it's one of my all-time favourite breakfast spots.</p>
      <p>I’m personally happy with any cafe if they can do a soft scrambled egg, soft bacon and buttery toast. And I’d love to hear about cosy, easy places: diners, doughnut shops, famous bruncheries with a half-hour wait.</p>
      <p>But I also want to hear about the creative breakfast spots, something that’s not for everyone. Is there such a thing as a rewarding, challenging breakfast?</p>
      <p>What’s the ideal meal at your ideal place? What should people avoid at an otherwise fantastic restaurant? And are there any other nice touches, like a morning happy hour or favourite waitstaff? Should we tell them who sent us?</p>
      <p>And if you have a favourite breakfast place outside the U.S., I want to hear it too. What’s the best morning meal you had on vacation?</p>
      <p>And for regular readers of the column, yes, we’ve moved it to Friday, when we’re feeling a little looser. I’ll be rounding up the best comments under the Staff tab on Monday, so do come back.</p>
