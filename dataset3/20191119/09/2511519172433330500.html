      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/EltonJohn">Elton John</a> has revealed he was “24 hours from snuffing it” when he contracted a serious infection after having surgery for prostate cancer, and said he was so sick he “had to learn how to walk again”. </p>
      <p>The singer was successfully treated for prostate cancer two years ago but said he was close to death after becoming ill in South America. </p>
      <p>“I came home and I got to London and I was very ill, I was rushed into hospital on intensive care,” said John, in an interview that will be part of the forthcoming BBC1 documentary <i>Uncensored.</i> </p>
      <p>“I picked up an awful bug from somewhere. And I was about 24 hours from snuffing it. We didn’t tell people that was going on at the time, so I had an annus horribilis as they say for half the year.”</p>
      <p>John, 72, added: “I literally had to learn how to walk again. I was extremely sick. All I could think about when I was lying in my hospital bed was, ‘Please don’t let me die, I want to see my children,’ and luckily I survived it.”</p>
      <p>He continued: “Now I’m fine, but there’s very few bits of me left. There’s no hair, there’s a pacemaker, there’s no tonsils, there’s no prostate, there’s no appendix, I’ve had kidney stones. I’m like the Bionic Woman.”</p>
      <p>The interview also explores John’s career, as well as his battle with alcoholism, with the musician revealing he “used to drink a bottle of Johnnie Walker Black every day”. </p>
      <p><i>Elton John: Uncensored </i>will air on 28 November on BBC1.</p>
