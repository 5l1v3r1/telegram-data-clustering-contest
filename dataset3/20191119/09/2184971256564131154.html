      <p>Detective Inspector Paul Ridley said: “Burglary is an extremely intrusive crime and the effect is often compounded further when the occupants are at home.</p>
      <p>"This is an aggravating feature of this case as the victim was present with her young children when the burglars have forced entry, scaling the wall of the mansion and brazenly ransacking the premises."</p>
