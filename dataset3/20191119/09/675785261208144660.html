      <h1>Per Mertesacker 'would love' Mikel Arteta reunion amid speculation over Arsenal job</h1>
      <h2>Mikel Arteta has again been linked with the Arsenal job as the pressure increases on boss Unai Emery after a slow start to the season</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T09:32:55+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 09:32</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>Per Mertesacker has opened the door for Mikel Arteta to return to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> as manager.</p>
      <p>Arteta, 37, spent five years at the Emirates as a player and captained the club during that time.</p>
      <p>He is now assistant boss to Pep Guardiola at <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> but was linked with the Arsenal job following Arsene Wenger's exit.</p>
      <p>Unai Emery ultimately got the job but Arteta's name has come up again with the pressure building on the Gunners boss.</p>
      <p>Mertesacker is now the head of Arsenal's academy and admits he would love to work alongside his former teammate again.</p>

      <p>I was his vice-captain at Arsenal and he trusted me," Mertesacker told FourFourTwo.</p>
      <p>"I was by his side during team meetings and we had a great bond. Iâ€™d love to work with him again, a top guy."</p>
      <p>Arteta has also been linked with the top job at another of his former clubs, with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> boss Marco Silva finding himself under increasing pressure.</p>
      <p>Speculation over his future has increased with Pep Guardiola's future at the Etihad unclear, with his current deal expiring at the end of next season.</p>

      <p>Unai Emery's job is not under immediate threat but that could change if results do not improve.</p>
      <p>Arsenal welcome struggling <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/southampton-fc">Southampton</a> to the Emirates this weekend before travelling to rock-bottom Norwich.</p>
      <p>Arsenal sit sixth after the international break and a good run is needed ahead of tricky encounters against the two Manchester clubs and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> , as well as trips to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/west-ham-united-fc">West Ham</a> and Everton, over the festive period.</p>
