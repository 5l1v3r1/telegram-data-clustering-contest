        <b>TV presenter Hayley McQueen was found passed out on the floor of the Sky Sports studio toilets after agonising period pains.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The new mum, 39, told how her battle with <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/topic/endometriosis/">chronic condition endometriosis</a> saw her faint minutes before going on air.</p>

      <p>Hayley wasn’t diagnosed with endometriosis until she was 36 - after two decades of being told by doctors she had everything from just bad periods to constipation and IBS.</p>
      <p>Endometriosis caused when cells like the ones in the lining of the womb are found elsewhere in the body. </p>
      <p>But instead of leaving the body as a period the blood has no way to escape <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/fabulous/4757264/endometriosis-symptoms-treatment/">leading to inflammation, pain and formation of scar tissue</a> - which can eventually cause infertility.</p>
      <p>One frightening episode saw her passed out in the Sky Sports studio ahead of going on air.</p>
      <p>She said: “The episodes I’ve had have been quite bad at Sky- I’ve not been able to go on air before.</p>
      <p>“I remember coming into work and I was white as a ghost and I felt terrible.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>“I had really horrific cramps and I’d wandered off to the toilet and then passed out.</p>
      <p>“I was just lying there on the floor, in an increasing amount of pain.</p>
      <p>“One of the makeup ladies came in and put a towel on my head and helped look after me and calmed me down. </p>
      <p>“They didn’t know what was wrong with me. </p>
      <p>“It was my female boss at the time who basically came in and put me in a taxi and sent me home.”</p>
      <p>The episodes were so severe she later found herself worrying if a Scottish matchday coincides with the day she was due to start her period.</p>
      <p>She added: “I used to get nervous, thinking - if I have one of these episodes I can’t even pull myself off the bathroom floor let alone sit in a chair and broadcast live.</p>

      <p>“You’re outside of a football stadium and not in a studio where another presenter can just quickly step in.”</p>
      <p>She was in her final year of school when she first started having debilitating periods, which she later went on to describe as having an “episode”.</p>
      <p>She said: “I’ve got a scar underneath my eye where I passed out at home and smashed my face against the edging of the sink unit in the middle of the night at my parents’. </p>

      </h3>
      <p>“Within the night I was in so much pain that I fainted from it, smashed my face open, couldn’t then get off the floor because I was faint, passed out again and hit my head against the floor. </p>
      <p>“I literally crawled into my parents’ room in the middle of the night.</p>
      <p>“I think they thought somebody had come through the window and attacked me!</p>
      <p>“I was in such a state I couldn’t even explain what had gone on. </p>
      <p>“That was one of the first, real, severe bouts of it and when I went to the doctors they told me I was just light-headed in the night and it was probably constipation.</p>
      <p>“I got my period the day after that.</p>
      <p>“Never in a million years did I think oh, could that have led to it. </p>
      <p>“So that was obviously the start of it and then it was on and off all throughout my 20s.”</p>
      <p>Hayley's endometriosis battle left her fearing she would never be able to have kids.</p>
      <h3>What are the symptoms of endometriosis?</h3>
      <p>
        <b>There are many different symptoms of endometriosis and they can vary in intensity. Some women with endometriosis will have no symptoms at all.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The most common symptoms are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Painful periods</li>
        <li>Painful sex</li>
        <li>Infertility</li>
        <li>Painful bowel movements</li>
        <li>Fatigue</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Other symptoms include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lethargy</li>
        <li>Nausea</li>
        <li>Extreme tiredness</li>
        <li>Depression</li>

      <p>She and model fiance Kirk Newmann, 38, were about to start IVF when she fell pregnant with baby Ayla, now six weeks old.</p>
      <p>The beaming new mum said: “I went through a really hard time but I got my miracle baby.”</p>
      <p>But when Hayley — the daughter of Scotland footie legend Gordon McQueen — did get pregnant, she was plagued with worry over fears that she would lose her baby.</p>
      <p>She explained: “When I first found out that I was expecting all I was worried about was having an ectopic pregnancy or miscarriage because of endometriosis.</p>
      <p>“I just could not quite believe that I was pregnant.</p>
      <p>“I felt like something was going to happen — something was going to go wrong and that it wasn’t going to carry on through.</p>
      <p>“It took me until about 16 weeks on before I announced it officially.”</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>Hayley, who was raised in Scotland but now lives in Buckinghamshire, is supporting the Scottish Sun Online's <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4923012/endo-period-stigma-endometriosis/">Endo Period Stigma campaign.</a></p>
      <p>She said: “I’m 100 per cent behind the campaign.</p>
      <p>"I think it’s really important to raise awareness.</p>
      <p>“Not even those who suffer from the condition know much about it or feel like they can speak openly about it.</p>
      <p>“If there is a pain affecting your everyday life in the run-up to your period, then go and get it checked out.</p>
      <p>“If you think it might be endometriosis, then just go and ask.</p>
      <p>“I was very lucky that it didn’t make me infertile — but it has for lots of people."</p>
