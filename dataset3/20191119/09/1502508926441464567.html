      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T09:25:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 09:25</time> by <a rel="author">Press Trust of India</a></address>
      <p>The Union Environment, Forest and Climate Change ministry has written to Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant stating it would form a committee to look into the decision to exclude Karnataka's Kalasa-Banduri project on Mahadayi river from the need for environmental clearance.</p>
      <p>The letter, dated November 18, was in response to a memorandum submitted on November 4 by an all party Goa delegation led by Sawant, officials said here on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Goa recently protested over a reported Central nod to Karnataka to go ahead with the Kalasa Banduri project which aims at providing drinking water to three north Karnataka districts by diverting Mahadayi water.</p>
      <p>Union minister Prakash Javadekar's letter said that "regarding the Kalasa Banduri project, it is informed through your memorandum that the proposal submitted to the ministry is more than a drinking water project and thus requires to be reviewed in detail by the ministry".</p>
      <p>"In this connection, a committee is being constituted to look into the issues raised in detail," the letter added.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the letter, Sawant said, "The minister has taken due cognisance of the representation submitted by our all party delegation and has constituted a committee to examine the issue."</p>
      <p>He said he was confident the committee will safeguard Goa's interest with a favourable decision.</p>
      <p>Sawant had led an all party delegation from Goa on November 4 asking Javadekar to withdraw his ministry's letter to Karnataka on excluding the need for environment clearance for Kalasa Banduri project.</p>
      <p>Earlier on Monday, Sawant had asked people to have patience on the state's dispute with neighbouring Karnataka over the sharing of Mahadayi river waters.</p>
      <p>"Have a little patience on the issue. I am not going to compromise on it. We will not allow Mahadayi water to be diverted," Sawant had told reporters.</p>
      <p>He had said the Congress, which ruled the state from 2007-12, should have protested against the project at the time, and this situation would have been avoided.</p>
