      <p>International pop singer Katy Perry has been slammed by a section of the internet for appearing to ignore security officials at the Mumbai airport over the weekend. At the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport, Katy was surrounded by fans and her security team as she headed inside.</p>
      <p>She did oblige a fan with her autograph and as she proceeded, Katy was asked for her passport at the entry gate. Katy, however, did not provide her passport and instead, walked ahead while her team was heard conversing with the official.</p>
      <p>The entire incident has been caught on camera as the video has gone viral on social media.</p>

      <p>The internet is furious as Katy refused to adhere to the instructions of the security official and censured her in the comments section of the post on Instagram. "They should respect our law....very shameful act," a user said while another added, "Yes she is an international superstar but that gives her no right to disobey Indian laws and security protocols."</p>
