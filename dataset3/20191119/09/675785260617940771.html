      <p>Strictly Come Dancing 2019 star Michelle Visage has shared her upset over leaving the BBC series this weekend.</p>
      <p>She's also addressed rumours of a falling out with her professional dance partner Giovanni Pernice, and claims she "stormed out" of the Blackpool Tower after filming ended.</p>
      <p>Viewers were gutted to see the American star leave the BBC series, losing the dance-off to AJ Pritchard and Saffron Barker.</p>
      <p>But Michelle faced claims that following the result, she fled the venue - something she has now cleared up, revealing she in fact stayed out dancing with her co-stars until super late.</p>

      <p>Speaking on Lorraine on Tuesday morning, Michelle also addressed the decision that she would not be part of the 2020 tour.</p>
      <p>She said: "Storm out of where? They said I stormed out of Blackpool... did I go in the ocean? Where did I go exactly?</p>
      <p>"No, I went to the party until 3am, I was dancing all night with Neil and Alex, Kevin, Oti and Gio. We were just having a really good time."</p>

      <p>Michelle added of the rumours: "None of it's true. I’m a party girl and I love people."</p>
      <p>On her bond with Giovanni and their vow to continue dancing, Michelle again hit back at reports of a falling out.</p>
      <p>She explained: "We have an incredible relationship. This whole thing was so much richer cos of my partnership with Gio.</p>

      <p>"I wouldn't want anyone else... I got the partner of my dreams and we'll continue dancing, I called him yesterday. He’s busy doing the pro stuff but I said, 'any hours you have, can we go dancing?'."</p>
      <p>After the news she wouldn't appear on the tour next year, Michelle admitted she was gutted but suggested it wasn't as big a deal as it had been reported.</p>
      <p>Michelle said: "I wanted to do it. I wasn’t asked to do it. I think there was a complication at the beginning with the dates.</p>
      <p>"But at the end of the day it’s going to be a great tour, I am not going to be on it. I would love to. I’m gutted. But again it’s the way it goes."</p>
