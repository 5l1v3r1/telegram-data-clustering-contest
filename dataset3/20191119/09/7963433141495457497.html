      <h1>Microsoft Teams Hits 20M Daily Users, Up 50% in 4 Months</h1>

      <p>Microsoft Teams now has <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2019/microsoft-teams-hits-20m-daily-users-50-4-months-compares-rival-slack/">more than 20 million daily active users</a>, a 50% spike in four months that puts the tool well ahead of its chief rival Slack. From a report:<i> Microsoft <a href="https://tech.slashdot.org/story/19/07/11/207211/microsoft-teams-overtakes-slack-with-13-million-daily-users">revealed the number of Teams users for the first time in July</a>, about a year after it first started offering a free version of the service. Teams has the advantage of being part of the Microsoft 365 ecosystem with a pool of millions of users to pull from, setting it up for rapid growth. Last month, Slack said it had more than 12 million daily users, a 37 percent increase over the prior year. Despite trailing Microsoft in the number of users, Slack has said its high level engagement -- the average paid customer spends 9 hours a day on Slack and more than 90 minutes actively using it -- gives it an advantage in shaping the future of work. The two companies are in the midst of a fierce, multi-year rivalry for dominance of the competitive market for chat-based collaboration tools, which also includes tech giants Google and Facebook. Microsoft and Slack have been aggressive in making splashy announcements this year to showcase the growth of their platforms.</i></p>
