      <p>If you're a regular person arriving in a new country for a visit, you'll normally have to get a cab or wait for a bus from the airport.</p>
      <p>Not Stephen Colbert, though. When he touches down in New Zealand, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is waiting to meet him.</p>
      <p>"She has come on the show a couple of times already now, and she invited me to visit New Zealand both times â€” and the second time she said she'd pick me up at the airport," Colbert explains at the start of the clip above. "So recently, I got on a plane to see if she meant it."</p>
      <p>Well, she absolutely did. And the 12 minute segment above documents exactly what happens next.</p>
      <p>It starts with Colbert attempting to unlock the prime minister's phone, and ends with what has to be the coolest BBQ ever.</p>
