      <p>CHICAGO (AP) — The top prosecutor in Cook County, Illinois, who was harshly criticized when her office suddenly dropped charges against actor Jussie Smollett, says she's running for re-election.</p>
      <p>Cook County State's Attorney<a href="https://twitter.com/SAKimFoxx"> Kim Foxx </a>says in a Tuesday news release that she hopes to continue reforming the criminal justice system in the county including Chicago that she began implementing when she was elected in 2016.</p>
      <p>The bid by Foxx, the first black woman to head the office, comes after a judge appointed a special prosecutor to examine why felony counts against the actor who had been charged with staging a racist and homophobic attack against himself last January were dropped. Foxx had recused herself after she had conversations with the actor's family.</p>
      <p>Foxx's challengers include a former judge and two former prosecutors.</p>
