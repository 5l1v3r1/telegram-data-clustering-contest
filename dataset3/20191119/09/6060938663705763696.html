      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T09:21:33+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 09:21</time> by <a rel="author">TIMESOFINDIA.COM</a></address>
      <p>Ajay Devgn has finally launched the trailer of his ambitious film ‘Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior’, and we must say, it did not disappoint. Co-starring <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Saif-Ali-Khan">Saif Ali Khan</a> and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kajol">Kajol</a> in lead roles, the trailer of the upcoming period drama promises epic battles scenes, great performances, stunning visuals all in 3D.</p>
      <p>While Ajay as the protagonist <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Tanaji-Malusare">Tanaji Malusare</a> shines through as the brave and heroic Maratha Subedar, it was Saif Ali Khan’s menacing portrayal of Uday Bhan, who stole the show, according to fans on social media.</p>
      <p>Many took to Twitter to praise Saif’s performance as the villainous Rajput official working for Mughal emperor Aurangzeb. Some even felt that Ajay has met his match in Saif, with who he is reuniting with on the big screen after almost 12 years. They were last seen together in the 2006 hit film 'Omkara'.</p>

      <p>Apart from being blow away by the dynamics of the two male leads, fans also appreciated Kajol’s performance as Savitribai.</p>
      <p>Not only did the trailer give its leading stars adequate screen-time in this 3-minute clip, but also managed to give its supporting cast their time to shine.</p>
