      <p>Will your town break its hottest November day on record? More than 100 schools are closed in anticipation of catastrophic fire conditions on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Fire authorities have compared Wednesday’s expected conditions with the deadly 2005 Black Tuesday bushfire, in which nine people died and hundreds of buildings were lost on the Eyre Peninsula.</p>
      <p>The CFS has drawn comparisons with the 2015 Pinery bushfire, which claimed two lives, and the Sampson Flat bushfire, also in 2015.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.perthnow.com.au/410cee7683b7469cc5e9dc0098532e29">statewide total fire ban </a>has been issued for today as a precautionary measure against the dangerous conditions.</p>
      <p>Catastrophic fire danger ratings have been forecast for seven districts – West Coast, Eastern Eyre Peninsula, Lower Eyre Peninsula, Yorke Peninsula, Mid North, Mount Lofty Ranges and Kangaroo Island.</p>
      <p>National parks and reserves in these seven districts will be closed. The weather bureau forecast Padthaway in the state’s South East and Cultana in the Yorke Peninsula are likely to break its previous November maximum records by as much as 4C.</p>
      <p>The temperature for most of the state is predicted to soar above 40C with Ceduna, a sizzling 45C.</p>
      <h3>The records set to topple</h3>
      <p>CFS Assistant Chief Officer Brenton Eden said the state, will experience “very difficult fire conditions” similar to those seen during the 2005 Wangary fire, also known as Black Tuesday.</p>
      <p>“This is the worst of the weather from a fire behaviour point that we will have seen,” Mr Eden said.</p>
      <p>“It’s up there with the events of Pinery, Bangor, Sampson Flat and Wangary in the past.</p>
      <p>He said that should a fire start, the fire activity will be intense, “it will be fast and it will be difficult to control.”</p>
      <p>The CFS will have the support of a large air tanker from NSW, which was last called upon by SA for the Pinery bushfire.</p>
      <p>But, Mr Eden said the predicted gale-force winds may mean they are unable to deploy any aircraft for bombing operations.</p>
      <p>They have 11 fixed-wing and 11 aerial support aircraft on standby.</p>
      <p>“South Australia has an extensive history of very credible aerial suppression, it’s not a feature across the world, but here in SA, the first sign of smoke, the first call of smoke our aircraft air airborne to that location,” he said.</p>
      <p>“And that’s generally before farm fire units and the CFS even get on scene.”</p>

      <p>Deputy Group Officer in the CFS Andy Warner advises people not to stay home if they are not confident and don’t have a safe, defendable space around their property.</p>
      <p>Mr Warner, who lives between Cudlee Creek and the Millbrook Reservoir, has spent the six years making his property bushfire safe.</p>
      <p>“It was actually a primary school that burned down in Ash Wednesday, so we have rebuilt that … to current bushfire standards,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Warner says he has fire protection systems in place and doesn’t have any vegetation up against the building, but his nine-year-old daughter and 11-year-old son will spend the day in Adelaide.</p>
      <p>He bought the property, originally the Millbrook Primary School, seven years ago and has lived there for a year.</p>
      <p>SA Power Networks spokesman Paul Roberts said South Australians could face a greater risk of distribution-network related outages on due to weather and fire danger conditions, including the potential for bushfire damage, airborne debris, or falling branches affecting power lines.</p>
      <p>The organisation may also turn power off in bushfire risk regions for safety reasons because of dangerous weather conditions but the decision would be made on a localised basis.</p>
      <p>“We’ve cancelled almost all planned work and associated outages on Wednesday,” he said.</p>
      <p>“We will stand down resources until they are needed later in the day, particularly around metropolitan Adelaide and Fleurieu areas.”</p>
      <p>SA Power Networks will monitor the weather and additional resources, including asset inspectors and operational response managers, are ready to respond to emergencies if needed.</p>
      <p>Energy Minister Dan van Holst Pellakaan said no load shedding has been planned.</p>
      <p>“While all extremely hot days are challenging due to high demand, the biggest risk we face is that of bushfires and its potential impact on electricity supply,” he said.</p>

      <p>Saddleworth mother Zoe Maguire, 29, had filled up her car and packed essential items such as photos and documents.</p>
      <p>“I will also be packing a small suitcase with clothes for the family and other necessities,” she said.</p>
      <p>Patrick of Coonawarra winemaker Luke Tocaciu, 34, said all vineyard workers would be pulled off the job on ahead of the 39.5C forecast.</p>
      <p>He was not worried about his production after 50mm rainfall earlier this month.</p>
      <p>“From July to October we’ve had below average rainfall … but we’ve had a nice and wet start this month,” he said.</p>
      <p>“The vines are very resilient, one day of 40C is fine.”</p>
      <p>Ceduna Foreshore Hotel manager David Carr said their coastal location attracted the locals looking to keep cool.</p>
      <p>“Because we’re on the edge of the ocean, when the cool breeze comes it tends to cool down pretty quickly,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Quite often there are mothers with their babies come down and spend some time at the bistro because it’s cooler than their homes.”</p>
