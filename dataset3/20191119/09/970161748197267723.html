      <p>A flock of turkeys appear to have made a desperate last attempt for freedom before they become someone’s Christmas dinner.</p>
      <p>Around 50 birds were filmed running near Red Lodge, in Suffolk, on Saturday.</p>
      <p>At first, it was thought they may have escaped from the nearby Traditional Norfolk Poultry farm but the owners have said they cannot confirm if the flock belongs to them.</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for the firm said: ‘We’ve had no reports of any turkeys escaping.’</p>

      <p>‘I think they escaped from a nearby farm, but I think turkeys tend to go back, so they might have done.’</p>
      <p>Another walker, who asked not to be named, filmed the gang of birds as it wandered through woodland clearings and posted the footage on Facebook.</p>
      <p>Members of the public were so concerned about the birds’ welfare one person even offered up their land for the turkeys to stay on.</p>

      <p>It’s not clear whether or not the turkeys have been returned to their home.</p>
      <p>Traditional Norfolk Poultry boast of breeding free-range and organic Norfolk Black and Norfolk Bronze turkeys which are renowned for their succulent meat and gamey flavour.</p>
