      <h1>Republic of Ireland - The Euro 2020 play-off permutations</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T09:45:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 09:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.newstalk.com/author/thommalone" target="_blank">Thom Malone</a></address>

        <b>Following the fifth draw with Denmark in six matches in just over two years, more Euro 2020 play-offs fun awaits the Republic of Ireland.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Euro 2020 play-offs do not operate under the traditional two-leg format, so familiar to Irish fans. Instead, four teams compete in a one-off semi-final and final for one remaining qualification spot.</p>
      <p>Rather than qualification standings, the Euro 2020 play-offs are based around Uefa Nations League rankings (thanks to Martin and Roy) with one spot given to each of the four leagues.</p>
      <p>It's not entirely straightforward as to how the line-up for those play-offs will be just yet. Mick McCarthy and his team will be keeping a close eye on proceedings in Group E.</p>
      <p>Wales host Hungary, a side they lost 1-0 to in the reverse fixture in June.</p>
      <p>Should Ryan Giggs' side beat Hungary this evening, then the Republic of Ireland will be away to Slovakia in the semi-finals.</p>
      <p>That scenario means Bosnia and Northern Ireland contest the other Euro 2020 play-off semi-final.</p>
      <p>If Slovakia qualifies at the expense of Wales, then the Republic of Ireland will be off to Wales for the semi-finals.</p>
      <h3>Waiting</h3>
      <p>Should Hungary do as they did in June and beat Wales then Ireland fans and players will have to wait until Friday’s Euro 2020 play-off draw to see whether the Boys in Green will play Wales, Slovakia or Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
      <p>In that situation, while the opposition is as yet unclear, the fixture will definitely be away from home. This is also the case if Wales draw and Slovakia unexpectedly slip up against Azerbaijan.</p>
      <p>If Ireland makes it through the first play-off semi. Then the winners of the other League B semi-final – between Bosnia and Herzegovina and either Northern Ireland, Wales or Slovakia – await in the final.</p>
      <p>Friday’s draw at 11am will decide who plays at home in the play-off final.</p>
      <p>The two Euro 2020 play-off games are scheduled to be played on Thursday the 26th of March and the following Tuesday, the 31st of March.</p>
