      <p>Spain's players were reportedly left in tears on Monday night, despite beating Romania 5-0, after receiving a surprise message from their current coach.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Robert Moreno has been in charge of La Furia Roja since Luis Enrique stepped down from his role following the sad passing of his daughter in June 2019.</p>
      <p>However, the latest reports in Spain suggest that the 42-year-old will leave his position despite securing Spain's qualification for the 2020 UEFA European Championship without losing a single match, and it seems Enrique is the man who will step back into the hot seat.</p>
      <p>According to <i>Marca</i>, Spain's stars were informed of the decision after their 5-0 win over Romania on Monday, and were left speechless and in tears.</p>

      <p>"In the end, we can't do anything," striker Gerard Moreno said, as quoted by <i>Marca</i>.</p>
      <p>"We train and do our best. We're with the coach, with all the staff.</p>
      <p>"We'd die for him."</p>
      <p>The coach was reportedly made aware of the decision by the Royal Spanish Football Federation earlier on Monday, and opted not to hold a press conference following the game.</p>
      <p>Moreno was in charge of the 2010 FIFA World Cup winners for nine games, winning seven and drawing two, with a goal difference of 29-4.</p>

      <p>Spain faced a similar tumultuous coaching situation ahead of the 2018 FIFA World Cup, when then coach Julen Lopetegui, who had guided his side unbeaten through qualification, was sacked on the eve of the tournament.</p>
