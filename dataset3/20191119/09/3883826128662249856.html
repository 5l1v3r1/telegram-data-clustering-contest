        <b>Dom Sibley says he has been planning for his England Test debut for "quite a long time" as he prepares to open the batting against New Zealand.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The opener, 24, is set to play in the first Test at Mount Maunganui on Wednesday at 22:00 GMT after topping the county batting charts this season.</p>
      <p>"Opening the batting, you have to accept that you are going to have some low scores," he told BBC Sport.</p>
      <p>"But it's a case of, if I do get in, I go big and make the most of it."</p>
      <p>Sibley scored 1,324 runs for Warwickshire in County Championship Division One this summer - no other player managed 1,000 - and made a century in England's opening tour match against a New Zealand XI.</p>
      <p>"The team hasn't been confirmed but the thought of potentially making my Test debut is pretty exciting," he said.</p>
      <p>"I've been thinking about it for quite a long time, been planning for this and working hard towards it. I'm just glad that it is close now."</p>
      <p>Sibley looks set to open alongside former Surrey team-mate Rory Burns, with Joe Denly - who opened in the final Ashes Test of the summer against Australia - or Zak Crawley likely to bat at three and captain Joe Root four.</p>
      <p>Sibley says he and Burns go "way back", adding: "He drove me to my first second team game, which I opened in with him.</p>
      <p>"To potentially open the batting with him in the Test match would be amazing."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, New Zealand coach Gary Stead is considering whether to name uncapped fast bowler Lockie Ferguson in his side to "fight fire with fire" with England's Jofra Archer.</p>
      <p>"(Archer's pace) is obviously a point of difference but we've got someone in our squad who bowls at a similar type of speed as well who's pretty quick in Lockie Ferguson," said Stead.</p>
      <p>"It's really exciting for Lockie and a potential debut for him at some stage."</p>
