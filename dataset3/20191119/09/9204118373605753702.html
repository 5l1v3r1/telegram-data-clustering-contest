      <h1>Holistic energy concept increases efficiency of paper mills in Germany</h1>

      <p>The current increase of packaging and pulp demand in the fiber industry is accompanied by numerous challenges, including fluctuating costs of energy and raw materials. Siemens AG (Munich, Germany; <a href="http://www.siemens.com/">www.siemens.com</a>) energy-efficient concepts and solutions are designed to help the paper industry set new global standards for efficiency, performance, and sustainability. A recent example is a project in Germany, where Siemens will help paper and packaging producer Palm increase its plant efficiency by providing a holistic energy concept. This includes the electrification of a new paper-machine production line and a new power plant equipped with the latest-generation gas turbine.</p>
      <p>Siemens secured the order earlier this year and will supply the complete electrification for Palm’s new paper-machine 5 production line at the paper mill site in Aalen (Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany) – from gas-insulated medium-voltage switchgears type 8DA10 and Sivacon S8 motor control centers to power transformers from 25 MVA to 112 MVA, Sivacon 8 PS busbar trunking systems, and Siemens’ innovative drive technology. The drive technology supplied will include 350 drives with sectional drives for the paper machine. The order also comprises the delivery of a SGT-800 gas turbine at the latest 62-MW rating and a SST-300 steam turbine for a new combined heat and power plant (CHP) at the site. “We are pleased to be expanding our global SGT-800 gas turbine fleet, this time in Germany. We have more than 370 units sold worldwide with a strong record of successful installations” says Karim Amin, CEO of Power Generation at Siemens Gas and Power.</p>
      <p>At the existing paper mills at the Eltmann site in Bavaria and the Wörth site in Rhinland-Palatinate, Siemens will replace older SGT-800 gas turbines with a lower rating with upgraded SGT-800 gas turbines and deliver a SST-300 steam turbine for each site. The new gas turbines will provide an additional 17 MW per site. The installed power is specified at approximately 70 MW per site and commissioning of the three power plants is planned for mid-2021. Palm signed long-term service contracts to ensure top reliability and efficiency for many years to come.</p>
      <p>“All of our customers have their unique demands for power supply,” says Thorbjörn Fors, CEO, Service Distributed Generation and O&amp;G at Siemens Gas and Power. “I’m delighted to see how, by delivering the latest technology and industry know-how, we can provide our customers with higher levels of efficiency and significant CO2 reduction per MWh that will benefit both them and the societies they serve.”</p>
      <p>The high efficiency of the SGT-800 combined with its fulfillment of the customer’s NOx requirement (below 15 ppm) ensures a low environmental footprint. The ongoing evolutionary development of the proven SGT-800 gas turbine means optimal reliability and is a future-proof investment for the continued sustainable operation of the paper mills. The three combined heat and power plants will generate sufficient power and steam to the mills and will also supply surplus power to the national grid.</p>
      <p>Papierfabrik Palm GmbH &amp; Co. KG, founded in 1872, is a leading manufacturer of newsprint and corrugated base paper. It operates two recycling companies, five paper mills, and 28 corrugated plants with a total workforce of approximately 4,000.</p>
