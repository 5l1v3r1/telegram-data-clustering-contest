      <h1>Trump acknowledges Turkey's position on S-400, Erdoğan says</h1>

      <p>President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said that the U.S. President acknowledged Turkey's position regarding the S-400 missile defense system after he told him about the circumstances.</p>
      <p>"I told Mr. Trump how Turkey was pushed into buying the S-400 missile defense system from Russia and he acknowledged our position," Erdoğan told a parliamentary group meeting of the Justice and Development Party (AK Party) on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The president continued by saying that he told his U.S. counterpart that Ankara would seek alternatives if the U.S. does not adopt a compromising stance regarding the F-35s, as he reiterated once again that Turkey will not give up the S-400s.</p>
      <p>Turkey decided in 2017 to purchase the S-400 system following protracted efforts to purchase air defense systems from the U.S. with no success.</p>
      <p>However, U.S. officials have advised Turkey to buy the Patriot missile system rather than the S-400 system from Moscow, arguing it is incompatible with NATO systems.</p>
      <p>Turkey has responded that it was the U.S.' refusal to sell it Patriots that led it to seek other sellers, adding Russia offered it a better deal, including technology transfers.</p>
      <p>Erdoğan also criticized the U.S. for calling terrorist PKK's Syrian offshoot the People's Protection Units (YPG) "partners."</p>
      <p>"PKK/YPG released thousands of Daesh members held in camps and prisons in Syria as blackmail. You know (the U.S.) had partners (in Syria), these are their so-called partners," Erdoğan said.</p>
      <p>The president highlighted Turkey's concerns in an official visit to Washington last week.</p>
      <p>The People's Protection Units (YPG) and its political wing, the Democratic Union Party (PYD), are the Syrian offshoots of the PKK, a designated terror organization in the U.S. and Turkey.</p>
