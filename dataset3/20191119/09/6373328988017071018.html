        <b>While anti-LGBTQ+ people have long argued homosexuality is unnatural, a new study could go some way to disprove that theory.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The ancient ancestors of all modern animals, including humans, could have been bisexual and engaged in homosexual acts, despite previous beliefs they were purely heterosexual, a new study has confirmed.</p>
      <p>Research conducted by Yale University now suggests homosexuality was probably widespread within animal behaviour from the very beginning.</p>

      <p>This comes after <a href="https://environment.yale.edu/news/article/yale-paper-challenges-how-scientists-study-same-sex-behavior-in-animals/">researchers studied the sexual behaviour</a> of more than 1,500 different animal species, including cows, snakes, monkeys and crabs, to find out why homosexuality persists in these creatures ‘despite not having an obvious evolutionary benefit’.</p>
      <p>Now, researchers believe homosexuality was part of our earliest DNA and therefore an entirely natural part of who we are.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Researcher Julia Monk wrote:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>If any trait other than homosexuality had been observed in such a diverse array of species it would be widely accepted as being part of our ancestral DNA rather than something that evolved later.</blockquote>
      <p>The idea that heterosexuality has always been the norm in society has always prevented us from accepting the notion that being bisexual could have been a thing from our pasts.</p>

      <p>Therefore, scientists have been working to solve the Darwinian paradox, which is why do animals practice same-sex sexual activity when it has no obvious evolutionary benefit and could lead to extinction if all members of species practice it?</p>
      <p>And now <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-019-1019-7">Yale University researchers</a> believe they have the answer. They believe our earliest animals ancestors practised ‘indiscriminate sexual behaviours directed towards all sexes’, rather than purely heterosexual sex.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Monk continued to explain:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>By shifting the lens through which we study animal sexual behaviour, we can more fruitfully examine the evolutionary history of diverse sexual strategies.</blockquote>
      <p>The study into same-sex sexual behaviour meant the team looked at anything that would not lead to procreating. This included individuals of the same sex, different species, dead bodies, inanimate objects and self-stimulation.</p>

      <p>Monk believes there is now no need to explain homosexuality’s origins because it has always been there. They believe it is likely a ‘derived trait’ that arose out of the bisexual nature of ancestor species.</p>
      <p>So, there we have it: same-sex relationships are just as natural as heterosexual ones.</p>
      <p>Try and argue with that, homophobes.</p>
