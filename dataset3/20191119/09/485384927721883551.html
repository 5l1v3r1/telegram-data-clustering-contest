      <h1>Australian cricket team has reacquainted itself with the line ahead of Pakistan Test series</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T09:20:40+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 09:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/richard-hinds/8496704" target="_blank">Richard Hinds</a></address>
      <p>For Australian cricket, the line is there again in plain sight.</p>
      <p>Yes, the old behavioural line that was drawn with good intentions, head-butted by those used it to justify dodgy tactics as well as avoid them, scandalously ignored in a Cape Town dressing room and seen only far off on the horizon ever since.</p>
      <p>Australian fast bowler James Pattinson did not merely find the line by directing a homophobic slur at an opponent during Victoria's Sheffield Shield match against Queensland, he sailed clean over it.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-17/james-pattinson-banned-for-first-test-vs-pakistan-at-gabba/11711982">Pattinson will miss the first Test against Pakistan starting Thursday</a> as the result of an accumulation of conduct code violations including this latest and most serious offence.</p>
      <p>But given the nature of the abuse, it would have been quite understandable had Pattinson been given a match on the sidelines to contemplate his intolerable outburst for this offence alone.</p>

      <p>Surely by now, even the most foul-mouthed suburban park cricket sledger understands the use of homophobic and racial taunts are not to be tolerated by opponents, onlookers and, you would hope, teammates.</p>
      <p>And even if we have not come that far we have the right to expect high-profile players on colossal Cricket Australia contracts will set the example, not succumb to such a base instinct in the heat of the moment.</p>
      <p>Pattinson, a hugely popular player among teammates, was at least quick to own his behaviour. "I'm gutted to miss a Test match, but the standards are there for a reason and the fault is mine," he said via a Cricket Australia statement.</p>
      <p>Steve Smith did not cross the line. But a man who has worked hard on and off the field to restore a tattered reputation got an abrupt reminder of the standards by which he will be judged for the remainder of his career.</p>

      <p>Smith's mistake was to demonstrably question a caught behind decision. He lingered at the crease, waved his bat and in so doing embarrassed the umpire who had raised his finger.</p>

      <p>This was not a mortal cricket sin. After all, no one is out in their own mind even when we are and most of us have lingered a second or two longer at the crease than we should.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the greater question is why Smith was so incensed when he had already made 103. Perhaps his mastery of the game is now such he finds the very idea of being dismissed perplexing.</p>
      <p>Regardless, the publicity surrounding an infringement on the minor end of the scale prompted an apology from the former Australian captain to his teammates as they assembled for the first Test.</p>
      <p>"I know a lot of kids watch me play and watch all of us play and the way we conduct ourselves when we get out as well as when we're batting," he said.</p>
      <p>"We have to be very mindful of that and sometimes just bite the bullet and just conduct ourselves in a better manner at times."</p>
      <p>Coincidentally Smith's apology was offered as Australian coach Justin Langer and captain Tim Paine conducted the now regular pre-series "values" session.</p>

      <p>This in itself was an encouraging indication the team leadership is guarding against complacency and particularly, you suspect, the possibility that time and recent on-field success might loosen standards.</p>
      <p>There have been allegations this had happened already during the Ashes series.</p>
      <p>In his recently released book, England all-rounder <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-15/ben-stokes-reveals-david-warner-sledges-spurred-headingley-win/11707064">Ben Stokes claims it was the vicious sledging of David Warner that inspired his incredible match-winning innings of 135</a> at Headingley as much as England's seemingly dire position.</p>
      <p>"I had extra personal motivation due to some things that were said to me out on the field on the evening of day three when I was trying to get through to stumps," wrote Stokes.</p>
      <p>"A few of the Aussies were being quite chirpy but, in particular, David Warner seemed to have his heart set on disrupting me."</p>
      <p>The idea that Stokes brilliance was directly related to Warner's unspecified "chirp" makes for popular reading in the English newspaper in which the book was serialised.</p>
      <p>Yet, in the context of a series in which the Australians were mostly on the Mary Poppins side of angelic, the allegation seems oddly self-serving and was adamantly denied by Paine who was well within earshot of Warner in Headingley.</p>
      <p>Indeed <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-08-14/england-cricket-star-ben-stokes-found-not-guilty-of-affray/10120670">given Stokes' own hardly clean slate</a> you might conclude he was so hard to dismiss because the Australians bowlers were running uphill all day to a batsman who had taken block on the moral high ground.</p>
      <p>Yet if Stokes is an unlikely moral arbiter then the combination of Pattinson's flagrant offence, Smith's relatively minor misdemeanour and even the perceptions created by Stokes's sledging allegations provide a timely warning.</p>
      <p>That "line" drawn initially by <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-28/steve-waugh-calls-for-committment-to-spirit-of-cricket-document/9595490">the well-meaning "Spirit of Cricket" statement</a> was mocked after Cape Town because the actions seemed so completely out of keeping with such high-minded words.</p>
      <p>In that context, the greatest achievement of the Langer-Paine era has not been the retention of the Ashes but the unexpectedly rapid rehabilitation of the team's public image without and, especially with, the publicly shamed Smith and Warner.</p>
      <p>But whether Cape Town was the result of heat-of-the-moment lunacy, poor locker room leadership or systemic cultural decline, it showed how quickly reputational damage could be self-inflicted.</p>
      <p>So when Langer and Paine reiterated the team ethos in Brisbane hopefully every Australian player was giving them wide-eyed attention, not snoozing at the back of the class as was once the case.</p>
