        <b>A report provided to the <a href="http://www.cubanews.acn.cu/%20">Cuban News Agency</a> by the Government in Las Tunas, indicates that until last April the subsidy to 4,972 nuclei with serious problems in their homes, for different reasons, had been approved, for the construction of basic housing cells and rehabilitation actions.</b>

      <p>Las Tunas, Cuba.- Since the delivery of financial assistance to natural persons was implemented, more than 207 million pesos have been allocated in the province to benefit 4,506 families. Most of the beneficiaries were affected by meteorological events, as well as people residing in very vulnerable houses, and of low income.</p>
      <p>Many recognize what the Revolution has done to provide them a decent dwelling, but others point out delays in the approval process, instability in skilled labor, and the presence of individuals around the stores for the sale of building materials, who are dedicated to buying and reselling them.</p>
      <p>The biggest damage to homes here occurred in September 2008, when Hurricane Ike -category five on the Saffir Simpson scale- damaged more than 80 thousand, mainly in the northern municipalities of Jesús Menéndez and Puerto Padre, where the event penetrated.</p>
      <p>The definitive solution to the more than seven thousand pending cases in Las Tunas is implemented through the popular movement in all the municipalities, in which eight housing poles (one per capita) are being built; and the manufacture of elements for floors, walls and hydraulic connections, through the use of local resources, is fostered.</p>
      <p>The largest of them is located on the outskirts of the city of Las Tunas, on the southern ring road and the road to Jobabo, where a project to build some 1,700 homes of different types is executed.</p>
      <p>Until 2030, the territory plans to build or rehabilitate around 44 thousand houses, with a view to raising the comfort of homes and improving the housing fund (62 percent is in good condition and 38 percent between regular and bad).</p>
