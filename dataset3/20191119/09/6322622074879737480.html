      <p>BEIJING (Nov 19): China’s Didi Chuxing will trial a premium ride hailing service in Japan offering Tesla, Lexus and Mercedes Benz vehicles, a company representative said.</p>
      <p>The ride-hailing firm will roll out a “DiDi Premium” trial later this month in some areas in Tokyo in a move to diversify its operations in Japan, the representative told Reuters via a text message on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>It will use premium vehicles including Tesla Model S sedans, Mercedes Benz S-class sedans and Lexus LS series sedans, and Didi hopes to eventually expand it to other major Japanese cities.</p>
      <p>Besides Tokyo, Didi offers taxi-hailing services in Osaka, Kyoto and Nagoya.</p>
      <p>In July, Lexus parent firm Toyota said it would invest $600 million in Didi Chuxing and a new joint venture as the companies seek to develop connected and electric vehicle technologies in China.</p>
      <p>Tesla started to take orders for Model 3 vehicles in Japan in May.</p>
