      <p>SNK has announced that the Nintendo Switch port of its rebooted fighter <i>Samurai Shodown</i> will arrive in the west early next year, following on from its Japanese release, which is scheduled for December 12.<br/><br/>While that news may be a little disappointing to fans eager to get their hands on the excellent new entry in the stalwart arcade series, the good news is that the western Switch release <i>will</i> offer the pre-order bonus of 1999's Neo Geo Pocket Color title <i>Samurai Shodown! 2</i> (awesome clicky directional stick not included).<br/><br/>You can check out a new trailer for the Switch release below. <i>Samurai Shodown</i> is available now on PS4, Xbox One, and Stadia. A PC port is also expected at some point in the future.</p>
