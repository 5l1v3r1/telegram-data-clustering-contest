      <h1>Cardi B’s New Freestyle Is Good</h1>

      <p>Thus far in 2019, Cardi B has only released two actual singles: The forgettable Bruno Mars collab “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2032300/cardi-b-bruno-mars-please-me/music/">Please Me</a>” in February and the satisfying shit-talker “<a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2045763/cardi-b-press/music/">Press</a>” in May. But the world has not exactly been starving for Cardi B content. She’s made a ton of guest appearances, and most of them have been good. Most of Cardi’s various other 2019 activities have also been good: The <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2053875/cardi-b-tour-concert-review/franchises/status-aint-hood/">arena tour</a>, the <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2051445/watch-the-hustlers-trailer-with-j-lo-cardi-b-lizzo-keke-palmer/video/">acting debut</a> in <i>Hustlers</i>, the <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2061518/is-a-rap-american-idol-even-possible/franchises/status-aint-hood/">Netflix reality show <i>Rhythm + Flow</i></a>, the <a href="https://www.stereogum.com/2053034/cardi-b-filmed-a-campaign-video-with-bernie-sanders/news/">public support of Bernie Sanders</a>. And now she’s just thrown a new freestyle up on Instagram. It’s good, too.</p>
      <p>Look: This new freestyle is probably not <i>news</i>. You don’t really need it in your life, with so much other Cardi stuff already out there. But it’s fun anyway. You might like it. Cardi, wearing a crop top and gigantic nails and standing in what may or may not be a kitchen pantry, talks some excellent shit over a lo-fi old-school blat-beat. She sounds great.</p>
      <p>The freestyle is only about a minute long, but Cardi gets some lines off: “I be in a mansion, and you be in my mentions.” “I don’t act, I’m a hustler, just playing my part.” “Holding my Grammy, rubbing my clit.” At the end, she clarifies: “This just a little something till I finish up the album, bitch.” Then she yells for us to suck her dick. Here, watch:</p>

      <p>I hope Cardi doesn’t rush her next album, but then again, I kind of hope she does.</p>
