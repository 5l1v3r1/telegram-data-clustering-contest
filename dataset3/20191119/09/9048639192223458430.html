      <p><b>(CNN) - </b>This could be a highly sought after job. A company wants to pay someone three thousand dollars a month to review marijuana.</p>
      <p>American Marijuana is a medical marijuana online magazine that provides research on cannabis products.</p>
      <p>The company is looking for someone to receive and critique a box containing different products every month.</p>
      <p>The products can range from weed, vapes, edibles, and CBD oils.</p>
      <p>But you have to live somewhere in the U.S. or Canada where medical marijuana is legal.</p>
      <p>The candidate must also critique the cannabis on camera and post blogs about the products.</p>
