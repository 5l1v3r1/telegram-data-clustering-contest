      <p>LONDON (Nov 19): World shares touched their highest in nearly two years on Tuesday as investors maintained bets that the United States and China can reach a deal to end their damaging trade war.</p>
      <p>The world's two largest economies are in talks on an initial deal to end an 18-month trade dispute that has damaged supply chains and upset global markets, with Washington due to impose a new round of tariffs on Chinese goods from Dec 15.</p>
      <p>A lack of clear news on the progress of talks has not deterred investors emboldened by a growing sense that risks of a recession, a spectre through the year, have receded.</p>
      <p>Looser monetary policy from major central banks like China has also helped bolster expectations for equities.</p>
      <p>The MSCI world equity index, which tracks shares in 47 countries, gained 0.1% to touch its highest since January last year.</p>
      <p>European shares also moved up, with the broad Euro STOXX 600 adding 0.4% to move to its highest since July 2015. Indexes in Frankfurt and London gained 0.4% and 0.5% respectively.</p>
      <p>Wall Street futures indicated a positive start, too, adding 0.2%.</p>
      <p>Investors said assumptions that an initial trade deal would be reached had outweighed any creeping doubts on progress in talks that stemmed from a lack of clear news, with a growing sense of positive economic fundamentals ahead.</p>
      <p>"Consensus is assuming that there will be a cyclical upturn," Stéphane Barbier de la Serre, a strategist at Makor Capital Markets. "It's like the market lowered its guard on the big risk metrics — and that has triggered a reweighting of funds from bonds to equities."</p>
      <p>Hopes that Beijing will deliver some economic stimulus in addition to Monday's surprise cut to a closely watched lending rate provided a boost to sentiment in Asian markets.</p>
      <p>MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.6%, with Shanghai blue chips gaining 1% and Hong Kong's Hang Seng up 1.4%.</p>
      <p>On the trade front, CNBC had overnight reported the mood in Beijing was pessimistic about prospects of sealing a trade agreement with the United States, buffeting the US dollar.</p>
      <p>But signs that suggested growing detente between the sides clouded the picture: a new extension granted by Washington to let US companies keep doing business with Chinese telecoms giant Huawei suggested a possible olive branch.</p>
      <p>That lack of clarity did unnerve some investors.</p>
      <p>"The longer we go on, the more concerns will arise. The reality is the clock is ticking," said Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at brokerage CMC Markets in Sydney.</p>
      <p>
        <b>US DOLLAR STABILISES</b>
      </p>
      <p>The listless mood in share markets was reflected by tepid moves among major currencies.</p>
      <p>The US dollar stabilised against a broad basket of other currencies on Tuesday after three consecutive days of losses, with investors awaiting the release of the minutes of the US central bank meeting at end-October when policymakers had cut interest rates.</p>
      <p>The dollar index against six major currencies was little changed at 97.807, close to a two-week low after weakening 0.6% in the last three days.</p>
      <p>"Trade headlines are dominating sentiment but in terms of the key event risk, the release of the Fed minutes will be a big one for market participants," said Morten Lund, a senior FX strategist at Nordea.</p>
      <p>The British pound settled at US$1.2953 after hitting a one-month high overnight as opinion polls showed Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative Party on course for victory at the Dec 12 election.</p>
      <p>In commodities, crude futures fell, losing 0.2% to US$62.29 a barrel, with a combination of jitters over trade and expectations of a rise in US inventories jangling nerves.</p>
