      <h3>How much does an iMac cost?</h3>

      <p>The new iMac is available from Apple <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/buy-mac/imac">here</a>, with the 21.5in model starting at £1,249/$1,299 and the 27in model starting at £1,749/$1,799, there is also a 2.3GHz entry-level model available at a lower price, but that model hasn't been updated since 2017.</p>
      <p>Apple's pricing for the current iMac line up looks like this, keep this in mind as you evaluate how good each deal is:</p>
      <p>
        <b>2017 21.5in iMac model (not updated in 2019)</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>2.3GHz dual-core 7th-gen i5, 1TB, Intel Iris Plus Graphics 640, Non Retina, <b>£1,049/$1,099</b></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>2019 21.5in iMac models</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>3.6GHz quad-core 8th-gen i3, 1TB, Radeon Pro 555X, 4K Retina, <b>£1,249/$1,299</b></li>
        <li>3.0GHz six-core 8th-gen i5, 1TB Fusion Drive, Radeon Pro 560X, 4K Retina, <b>£1,449/$1,499</b></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <b>2019 27in iMac models</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>3.0GHz six-core 8th-gen i5, 1TB Fusion Drive, Radeon Pro 570X, 5K Retina, <b>£1,749/$1,799</b></li>
        <li>3.1GHz six-core 8th-gen i5, 1TB Fusion Drive, Radeon Pro 575X, 5K Retina, <b>£1,949/$1,999</b></li>
        <li>3.7GHz six-core 9th-gen i5, 2TB Fusion Drive, Radeon Pro 580X, 5K Retina, <b>£2,249/$2,299</b></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Note: Apple increased UK prices for the MacBook Pro line up in July 2019, adjusting them according to currency fluctuations. MacBook Pro prices were adjusted by £50 in most cases (£100 in the top of the range). We expect that Apple will do the same to the iMac in the next few months, so we could soon have to pay £50 more per model! </p>
      <p>These are the prices Apple quotes, but you can get some great deals if you shop around... Or you could just keep reading as we've done the hard work for you!</p>

      <h3>Top Mac desktop discounts available now</h3>
      <p>In this section you will find some of the best deals we've seen for iMacs as well as the Mac mini and other Mac desktops. We update this list weekly, so it should always be spot on in terms of how much you can save, give or take a few pounds. (Retailers often make small tweaks to the price, so if it's gone up it might be worth waiting a week or so to see if it comes down again.)</p>

      </p>
      <p>This is a great discount on the top-of-the-range 2019 27in iMac with 9th-gen Intel processors, trumping the £270 discount that was available in October. </p>

      </p>
      <p>Save money on the <b>2019 iMac</b> with this deal from Currys PC World. It's better than the firm's advertised discount because this is the top-of-the-range £2,249 model.</p>
      <p>If stock runs low, an identical deal is offered by <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07NK5W4BM/?ascsubtag=41-3665528-19-0000000">Amazon</a>.</p>

      </p>
      <p>With this deal you can get money off a 27in Retina 5K iMac - but note, this is the 2017 model, with 7th gen quad-core Kaby Lake chips, running at 3.8GHz, with Radeon Pro 580 graphics. Back when it was on sale it was the top-of-the-range model and cost £2,249 (although right now you'd probably be looking at spending £1,849 on a similarly specced model). John Lewis is currently selling it for £1,799.</p>

      </p>
      <p>John Lewis has money off the <b>2019 3.6GHz quad-core iMac</b> (£1,249 at Apple).  This model isn't the cheapest iMac - Apple still sells a 2017 model at the entry-level, but with this price cut this Mac is much better value than the entry-level model.</p>
      <h4>5. Apple 27in iMac, 3.4GHz quad-core, 5K Retina Display, 1TB Fusion drive (2017)</h4>

      </p>
      <p>Amazon is offering money off 2017's entry-level 27in iMac. This model has a 3.4GHz 6-core processor and the Radeon Pro 570 graphics. It's a great saving for this powerful machine.</p>
      <h4>6. Apple 21.5in iMac, 3.4GHz quad-core, 4K Retina Display, 1TB Fusion Drive (2017)</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.macworld.co.uk/cmsdata/deal/3687439/apple_imac_21inch_201710_thumb450.jpg"/>

      </p>
      <p>You can save on the original price of this 2017 21.5in iMac at Amazon. This model has a 4K display and a 1TB Fusion Drive which combines an SSD with a hard drive for the best of both worlds. Note that Apple updated the iMac range in March 2019 and this model has been replaced with a new iMac with better specs so the previous price is a little misleading.</p>
      <p>Still, considering that Apple is selling the current entry-level iMac for £1,049, despite the fact that it's from 2017 too, this deal is pretty good.</p>
      <p>This isn't the best price we've seen for this iMac on Amazon though, at the beginning of November it was £977.97 so it might be worth keeping an eye on it!</p>

      </p>
      <p>You can get money off the <b>newest (2019) 3.0GHz 6-core iMac</b> with this Amazon deal. There's also <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B07NK5W4BN?ascsubtag=41-3665528-19-0000000">money off the 3.6GHz Core i3 model</a>.</p>

      <p>If it's the <b>2019 3.6GHz quad-core iMac</b> (£1,249 at Apple) you want, then check out Laptops Direct. The discount was more previously though - we've recently seen £288 off. Also note that the saving that Laptops Direct is quoting doesn't align with any Apple's price. </p>

      </p>
      <p>Get the entry-level iMac for less than £1,000 with this Amazon deal (which is about £20 better than it was at the start of May 2019). But remember, this model lacks a Retina display and hasn't been updated since 2017 - and if you look for a discount on a different model from the 2017 iMac range you will be getting a much better deal.</p>

      </p>
      <p>With this discount you can get an iMac for less than £1,000. Although this is the non-Retina display iMac, with a dual-processor, and it hasn't been updated since 2017, so it's not the most powerful of iMacs, you could probably find a better iMac without paying much more.</p>
      <h3>Where to find the best iMac deals</h3>
      <p>If you want serious savings it's best to look beyond Apple itself. Some Mac retailers offer great discounts on Apple products and Apple accessories, so you should be able to save a few hundred pounds off some iMac configurations.</p>
      <p>Beware, though. The Mac listed by the reseller may be an older model than the one Apple currently sells. We've seen resellers advertising Macs with money off based on the price they were previously sold at by Apple, even after Apple has started selling a newer Mac at the same price - so the deal often looks better than it actually is.</p>
      <p>To get an idea of what the old model should be worth, take a look at <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/refurbished">Apple's refurbished store</a> to see what Apple is selling the older version for (and remember that buying from Apple, even if it's refurbished, will mean you get a full year's warranty).</p>
      <p>So be careful to check the age and spec of the machine being sold, and don't automatically assume that it's current. For this reason we are careful to list the spec and year of the model in our description.</p>
      <p>We tend to find some good deals on new Macs at Apple reseller <a href="http://clkuk.tradedoubler.com/click?p(277729)a(1538920)g(23715040)epi(41-3665528-11-0000000)url(https://www.krcs.co.uk/)">KRCS</a>. Discounted Macs often include built-to-order configurations, too.</p>
      <p>For accessories like software, keyboards, or mice, check out all the normal electronics retailers you might consider - see our list below for inspiration - and take a look at our guides to the <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/mac/best-keyboards-for-mac-2017-3590365/">best keyboards</a> and <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/mac/best-mac-mouse-3610923/">mice for Macs</a> as well as <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/apple/best-printer-deals-3686938/">best Mac printer deals</a> and <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/feature/apple/best-hard-drive-deals-3687494/">Mac hard drive deals</a>.</p>

      <p>One of the best places to look for iMac deals all year round is the <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/browse/home/specialdeals/mac/imac">Apple Refurbished Store</a>. There, you'll find huge iMac discounts, sometimes even on the latest models. These iMacs have been returned to Apple for various reasons, and then completely revamped ready for resale. One of the major benefits in buying a refurbished Mac from Apple is that it will come with a one-year warranty so Apple may fix or replace it for free should anything happen to it in that first year.</p>
      <p>You won't be able to tell the difference between a refurbished iMac and a brand-new iMac, aside from the box it comes in, which is white to prevent people buying them and attempting to sell them as new. <a href="https://www.macworld.co.uk/how-to/mac/should-you-buy-a-refurbished-mac-3448814/">Find out more about buying a refurbished iMac here.</a></p>
