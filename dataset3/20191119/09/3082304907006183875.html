        <b>Despite facing a truckload of criticism from the likes of former Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger and ex-Chelsea teammate John Obi Mikel regarding his weight issues and work ethic, Real Madrid ace Eden Hazard has insisted that he is “in good shape”.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hazard’s relatively silent start to 2019-20 also saw him facing criticisms from all corners, as Wenger described him to be “too heavy” and John Obi Mikel labelled him “the laziest player I have played with”.</p>
      <p>However, while speaking to <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/29908/11864413/eden-hazard-real-madrid-winger-insists-he-is-in-good-shape-after-weight-concerns"><i>Sky Sports</i></a> on Monday, the Belgian himself insisted that he is fully fit and will “always try” to do his best.</p>
      <p>“For the last month I’ve been in good condition with no injuries,” he said, before adding:</p>
      <p>“I’m in good shape. When I’m on the pitch I will always try to do my best, with Real Madrid or Belgium. I just want to keep this momentum.”</p>
      <p>It was during 2019 July that Hazard finally made his dream move to Real Madrid, after years of speculation. <i>Sky Sports</i> reports that the LaLiga giants signed the 28-year-old in a deal that could reportedly rise to a club-record transfer of £130million, once all bonus payments are completed.</p>
      <p>Needless to say, the star attacker who amassed 110 goals and 92 assists for Chelsea across 352 appearances, arrived at the Santiago Bernabeu amidst huge expectations – but so far this season, he has not impressed much, having scored just one goal and provided four assists for <i>Los Blancos </i>in 11 appearances across all competitions.</p>
