      <h1>Julian Assange won't get visit from Pamela Anderson due to 'personal emergency'</h1>

      <p>After being his champion outside prison, Pamela Anderson has had to cancel another visit to Wikileaks founder Julian Assange due to a ‘personal emergency’.</p>
      <p>While Assange remains in the big house awaiting trial after failing to surrender to the court while in the Ecuadorian embassy, Anderson has been his mouthpiece, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/23/pamela-anderson-believes-julian-assanges-life-risk-unhealthy-belmarsh-prison-10791147/">claiming his life ‘is at risk’ inside prison.</a></p>
      <p>The Baywatch star was meant to be visiting Assange today, before holding a press conference outside Belmarsh Prison in south-east London, but that’s now been scrapped.</p>
      <p>A statement from the Don’t Extradite Assange campaign said: ‘Pamela has a personal emergency which has meant she has had to go home and cancel everything for the next two weeks.’</p>
      <p>Anderson recently said Assange had been subjected to ‘traumatic psychological torture’, as she urged his home country Australia to stop him being extradited to the US, where he faces 18 charges.</p>

      <p>Assange was jailed for 50 weeks in May for breaching his bail conditions after going into hiding to avoid extradition to Sweden over sex offence allegations.</p>

      <p>In the US he faces 18 charges, including allegations that he conspired to break into a Pentagon computer and worked with former US army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to leak hundreds of thousands of classified documents.</p>
      <p>‘He needs to be set free… He was right seeking asylum because everything he said would happen, happened,’ Anderson said on Good Morning Britain in September.</p>

      <p>Recalling her recent visit to Belmarsh Prison, Pamela told Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid via video link: ‘I visited him in Belmarsh and it’s not a place you want to go visit.</p>
      <p>‘Especially a place you don’t want to leave one of your dear friends. I care a great deal about Julian and he’s been psychologically tortured, that’s been talked about in the UN.’</p>
      <p>In May, a UN expert said Assange was showing symptoms associated with extensive exposure to psychological torture living in Belmarsh Prison.</p>
      <p>Applauding Assange for releasing secret documents via WikiLeaks, Pamela said: ‘I just want people to understand that this is a good person who has dedicated himself to telling the truth to the public which we deserve to know.</p>
      <p>‘Exposing war crimes and the people he’s exposed haven’t faced any penalty. But he’s sitting in prison because there are obviously more stories to keep.’</p>
