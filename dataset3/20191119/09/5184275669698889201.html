      <p>While Nawazudding Siddiqui is a master of taking up tricky characters, he failed to impress the audience with his latest offering <i>Motichoor Chaknachoor</i>. Also starring Athiya Shetty, the film is a romantic comedy that hit the theatres a week ago. Talking about the failure of the film, director Debamitra Biswal opened up about what went wrong and blamed the producers for ruining the film.</p>
      <p>Debamitra Biswal had a fallout with producer Rajesh Bhatia and only after watching the final product in the court, she realised that the movie’s story-line was totally changed. In an interview with SpotboyE, Debamitra said she would like to disown the film now after seeing what they had done to it.</p>

      <p>“I was shown the film when the court had issued an order to Rajesh Bhatia (producer) stating that you will have to show the film to the director. And after seeing the movie, I thought to myself: OMG! What have they made?” revealed the director.</p>
      <p>Talking about Nawazuddin and Athiya’s story, Debamitra said, “I had directed the film no doubt, but they chucked out portions and introduced unnecessary shots. There is nothing left in the film. It looks like a C-grade Bhojpuri film.”</p>
      <p>She went on to say, “I wish I could show you my version of the film. After the fight, they decided to edit the film and Bhatia himself set about to do it. Also, the story was changed totally. This isn’t the story that I set out to make. They have ruined my film and my career completely.</p>
      <p>“About 10-15 days before, a senior official from Viacom18 told me to show them my version. They loved it so much that they couldn’t stop praising it. I asked if they could come up with a solution. But, they did not. It was pre-decided to release the film on Nov 15 I guess, so they went ahead with Bhatia’s version. My film, I would say, stands ruined.”</p>
      <p>“Yes they have and I called them up after watching the film asking them to take off my name because this is not what I had made. It’s such a horrible film. I have, in fact, written on Facebook asking people to not watch this film,” Debamitra told SpotboyE.</p>
      <p>She even talked about how she contacted Athiya about the film and revealed that Athiya felt “dejected that after so much of hard work, this happened. The day she saw this film, she started crying.”</p>
      <p>She was even asked about Nawazuddin Siddiqui’s reaction but Debamitra revealed that she never understood why Nawaz went with Rajesh’s version of the film.</p>
