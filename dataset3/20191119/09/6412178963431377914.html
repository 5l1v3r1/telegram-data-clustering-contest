        <b>West Ham co-chairman David Gold has hit out at former Manchester United midfielder Roy Keane over his recent Declan Rice comments.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Keane, who coached Rice in the Republic of Ireland squad before he swapped countries to play for England, <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/keane-takes-declan-rice-to-the-cleaners-as-he-picks-apart-man-utd-targets-game"><b>had a dig at the West Ham midfielder’s performances</b></a> on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Working for ITV on England’s 4-0 victory over Kosovo, Keane was asked what Rice could improve on if he wants to become a top player, to which he responded: “Where he needs to improve, where do you want me to start? His positional play, I don’t think he’s been consistent enough, he doesn’t stay with runners, he’s sloppy in possession, I can go on.”</p>
      <p>And Gold thinks Keane needs to “get over” the fact that Rice swapped the Ireland for England at international level.</p>
      <p>Gold told <i>ClaretandHugh</i>: “Keane needs to get over it. Declan made his choice and I think that is what’s behind it as far as Keane is concerned.</p>

      <p>“It’s pretty shameful when a former professional talks the way he did about a young man. It was low, outrageous, unfair and arrogant to pick him out of all the England players.</p>
      <p>“It wasn’t even an analysis of the boy who is 20 years old who has barely started his career in the international team for God’s sake.</p>
      <p>“This isn’t the first time he’s done it. In a previous game he said he should be sitting in the studio with the pundits rather than being on the pitch. Shocking! Declan has chosen to play for England and Roy Keane needs to get over that.”</p>
