Among the other soldiers, one who was very close to Shivaji was Tanhaji Malusare who fought like a lion and sacrificed his life for Swarajya during the battle of Sinhagad. <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Saif-Ali-Khan">Saif Ali Khan</a> will be seen playing antagonist Uday Bhan, a Rajput official working for Mughal emperor Aurangzeb.</p>
