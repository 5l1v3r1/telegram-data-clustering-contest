      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/megan-barton/">Megan Barton</a> Hanson can’t see herself ever dating another man – or even watching porn involving guys.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/love-island/">Love Island</a> star came out as bisexual after her split from Wes Nelson in January, and has since dated Towie star <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/demi-sims/">Demi Sims</a> and singer songwriter Chelcee Grimes.</p>
      <p>But despite having dated men in the past, it seems Megan is leaning more towards women for future relationships.</p>
      <p>Speaking on <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/never-mind-the-botox-with-megan-barton-hanson-and-guest/id1482254841?i=1000457190462">The Truth Flirts podcast</a>, hosted by Mel B in partnership with Badoo, the 25-year-old said: ‘I can’t ever see myself getting back with a guy. Even now when I watch porn, it’s only lesbian porn, I can’t even look at a d***.’</p>

      <p>Mel, 45, laughed: ‘Lesbian porn is more sensual, I think anyway. It’s nicer and kinder.’</p>

      <p>Both stars have dated women in the past, and discussed how being in a same-sex relationship differs from being in a heterosexual partnership.</p>
      <p>Spice Girl Mel, who previously dated Christine Crokos, said: ‘I had a five-year relationship with a woman and it was an intense five years but it was actually a really beautiful five years.</p>
      <p>‘We barely kind of argued, because we both thought the same, we both wanted the same out of life. It was really interesting when I actually compare it to my other relationships.’</p>

      <p>Megan agreed: ‘Definitely with girls, it’s so much deeper. When you go on a first date with a guy, it’s very, bit of banter, you’re just joking. With a girl, you know about the ex, what you want to do in ten years, five years, it’s a lot.’</p>
      <p>Speaking about her first same-sex relationship, the reality star said: ‘It was only two months but it was so much deeper than I’ve ever had with any guy. I’ve had three serious relationships with guys but the two months I had with this girl, it was just so intense.</p>
      <p>‘For me, it was really hard. I don’t see myself as a girly girl. She was like, “just tell me something romantic”. With men, all you need to say is “oh, your d*** looks big”, or just sit on their d*** and they’re happy. But with a girl, I had to be like “oh my god babe, you look so beautiful today”.</p>

      <p>‘It’s a learning curve, but it was nice. I’d say I prefer dating girls.’</p>
      <p>It seems that Megan is now back with Chelcee – who is also a footballer – as the pair shared videos of themselves kissing and enjoying a dinner together over the weekend.</p>
      <p>The pair had initially split after <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/22/megan-barton-hanson-chelcee-grimes-texting-woman-split-10963612/">allegedly discovering they had both DMd model Teddy Edwardes</a> – but it seems the stars are back on track.</p>
