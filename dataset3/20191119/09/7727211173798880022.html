      <p>BBC Breakfast star Sally Nugent is set to bring some festive cheer to Port Sunlight village this December as she hosts an evening of Christmas carols in aid of Claire House Children’s Hospice.</p>
      <p>The TV presenter and journalist will join Claire House parents and young people for the charity’s Carols and Candles event on Tuesday, December 3, in Christ Church, Port Sunlight.</p>
      <p>Claire House Children’s Hospice helps seriously and terminally ill children make the most of the time they have, however long or short that may be.</p>

      <p>Event fundraiser Rachel Handley said: “Carols and Candles is one of our most special events of year, and we are so grateful to hold it in the beautiful Christ Church in Port Sunlight.</p>
      <p>“Hearing the gorgeous Vale of Clwyd Singers by candlelight and listening to the very festive readings really gets you in the Christmas spirit.</p>
      <p>“We can’t wait to see everyone there, enjoying an evening that is sure to make everyone feel festive.”</p>
