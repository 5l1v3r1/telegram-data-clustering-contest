      <p>The <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/united-states.html"><b>United States</b></a> has said it no longer considers Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem illegal.</p>
      <p>US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Monday his country will no longer abide by a 1978 State Department legal opinion that the settlements were "inconsistent with international law".</p>
      <p>"After carefully studying all sides of the legal debate, this administration agrees... (the) establishment of Israeli civilian settlements in the West Bank is not, per se, inconsistent with international law," Pompeo said.</p>
      <p>The move, which was immediately <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/palestinians-slam-policy-reversal-israeli-settlements-191118211821254.html">slammed</a> by Palestinians and rights groups, is the latest in a series of US measures against the Palestinian people and their leadership.</p>
      <p>It comes amid deteriorating ties between the two sides, especially following US President Donald Trump's controversial recognition of <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12/trump-transcript-full-jerusalem-israel-capital-171208093555029.html"><b>Jerusalem as Israel's capital</b></a> and the relocation of its embassy there last year.</p>
      <p>That decision drew universal condemnation from Arab leaders and criticism around the world, while Palestinian leaders, who see East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state, said the US was no longer an honest broker in negotiations.</p>
      <p>Since Trump took office on January 20, 2017, Israel - a traditional US ally that receives military aid annually from Washington - has taken a series of measures that have been <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/07/critics-call-israel-nation-state-law-provocative-racist-180719165054037.html"><b>criticised as "racist" and "discriminatory"</b></a> against the Palestinian people.</p>
      <p>Trump is still expected to unveil details of what he has long referred to as the "deal of the century" to resolve the <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/subjects/israelipalestinian-conflict.html"><b>Israeli-Palestinian conflict</b></a>. The unveiling of the plan has so far been delayed twice, with the US citing Israeli elections as the reason for the delay. The economic part of the agreement has already been rejected by the Palestinians.</p>
      <p>Here is a timeline of key US decisions regarding Palestinians since Trump assumed office.</p>
