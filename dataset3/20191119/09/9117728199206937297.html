      <p>Amongst the hectic end to the Brazilian Grand Prix with Bottas retiring, both Ferrari’s crashing into each other and Lewis Hamilton sending Alex Albon for a spin there was an ongoing investigation into drivers using DRS under yellow flags during the race.<br/> <br/>This previously meant a penalty to the driver but the rules have since been relaxed with penalties only being given should a driver fail to reduce their speed.<br/> <br/><i>“The overriding factor with double yellow flags is the requirement to slow and significantly slow,” </i>he said as quoted by <a href="https://www.racefans.net/2019/11/19/why-stewards-didnt-investigate-drivers-for-using-drs-under-yellow-flags/"><i>RaceFans.net</i></a>.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“That’s what we looked at with all of them and all of them complied with that.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“So the stewards looked at that and determined that no investigation was necessary.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“The overriding factor of slowing for the double yellows was absolutely complied with.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>As to whether the rules need further clarification Masi believes that’s not the case and is the reason for stewards investigating what happens on track to help make a decision.</p>
      <p><i>“It’s one of those things you can’t make a rule to suit every situation,” </i>he added.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“It’s the reason why we have stewards to make a determination on things and they said the overriding factor is that they slow, which they all did.”</i>
