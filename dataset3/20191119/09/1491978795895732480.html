        <i>Brilliantly illustrated tales by Sophie Dahl and Oscar-winner Lupita Nyong’o will charm young readers</i>
      </p>
      <p>When she was younger, Sophie Dahl’s stepgrandmother used to tease her: “Who do you think you are, Madame Badobedah?” The name (which “rhymes with ooh la la”) stuck, and has now inspired the model turned author’s first foray into children’s writing. Opening this longer-form picture book, it’s hard to resist the urge to sniff out traces of a certain other grandparent. But with <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/madame-badobedah-9781406384406.html"><b>Madame Badobedah</b></a> (Walker), Dahl junior proves she has a playful and beguiling voice all of her own.</p>
      <p>Mabel is an only child whose parents run a seaside B&amp;B. In one exquisite picture, illustrator Lauren O’Hara depicts the Mermaid hotel as a sort of hive buzzing with boxers, band members and other intriguing characters. Mabel is not impressed when a rude old lady moves in with 23 bags, hundreds of trinkets and a strange tortoise called Boris. She turns detective, concluding that the new guest, whom she names Madame Badobedah, is a villain. But in time they strike up a friendship and find themselves venturing through a Narnia-esque cupboard.</p>
      <p>Pairing Dahl with O’Hara is a masterstroke. Her painterly images are colourful and chic but mysterious, just like Madame Badobedah, whose life story, refreshingly, is never fully revealed. Hopefully sequels await.</p>
      <p>Other memorable girl protagonists join Mabel this season. <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/sofia-valdez-future-prez-9781419737046.html"><b>Sofia Valdez, Future Prez</b></a> (Abrams) is the latest in Andrea Beaty and David Roberts’s bestselling <i>Questioneers</i> series, featuring inspiring children from Miss Lila Greer’s grade two class (first came <i>Iggy Peck, Architect)</i>. When her beloved Abuelo hurts his ankle at the local landfill, Sofia finds herself campaigning for this dirty “Mount Trashmore” to be turned into a park. Partly a response to the political climate in the US, the book shows Sofia, a child of immigrants, overcoming obstacles becoming a great leader. The series excels in presenting relatable children who often fail before succeeding, rather than fully formed heroes.</p>

      <p>A wearying number of celebrities are penning picture books these days, but only some, such as <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/sulwe-9780241394328.html"><b>Sulwe</b></a> (Puffin) by Lupita Nyong’o, the Oscar-winning star of <i>12 Years a Slave</i>, add to the form. Loosely autobiographical, and with wide-eyed, Disneyesque illustrations by Vashti Harrison, <i>Sulwe</i> gently explores colourism – preferential treatment of people with lighter skin. What starts as a simple account of a five-year-old Kenyan girl “born the colour of midnight”, who wishes she looked different, becomes a mythological adventure as Sulwe travels to the beginning of time to meet the sisters of night and day, learning that there’s magic in both light and dark.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, there’s a party going down in monsterland: Beast has captured a tasty-looking child and invites his pals to share his catch in Emma Yarlett’s riotous, neon-hued <a href="https://guardianbookshop.com/beast-feast-9781406386639.html"><b>Beast Feast</b></a><b> </b>(Walker). Can Dinner charm Beast into changing the menu? The Ahlbergs pioneered the picture book containing letters to open with <i>The Jolly Postman</i> in 1986, and this contribution to the genre, with RSVPs from Sir Gutguzzler and co, is a hoot. Independent readers should also enjoy the gruesome recipes on the endsheets on the inside front. Anyone for eyeball sushi?</p>
