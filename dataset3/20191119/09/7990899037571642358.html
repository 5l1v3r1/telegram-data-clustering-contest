      <p>It was reported just days ago that two corrections officers who were on duty at the Metropolitan Correctional Center the night convicted sex offender and accused child sex-trafficker <b>Jeffrey Epstein</b> died turned down a plea deal offered by federal prosecutors. It was a clear sign that the Department of Justice was considering criminal charges. On Tuesday, the corrections officers became defendants.</p>
      <p>The federal employees were arrested on federal charges related to their failure to check on Epstein as required, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/19/nyregion/epstein-prison-guards-arrested.html?campaign_id=60&amp;instance_id=0&amp;segment_id=18914&amp;user_id=2135899448115c770b91ba207c25998f&amp;regi_id=20687125ing-news">the <i>New York Times</i> reports</a>. The guards fell asleep when they should have been checking on Epstein, then covered that up by falsifying records, authorities allege.</p>
      <p>Last Friday, <a href="https://apnews.com/11ae6142bbb84af49daae80b94f1b4e2?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=AP">the <i>Associated Press</i></a> reported the existence of a plea deal offer related, again, to the alleged falsification of prison records. The guards apparently turned that down.</p>
      <p>“As many as 20” corrections officers received grand jury subpoenas in the wake of Epstein’s death. Epstein’s death was officially ruled a suicide, but at <a href="https://lawandcrime.com/exclusive/exclusive-never-before-seen-autopsy-photo-of-jeffrey-epsteins-broken-bones-released/">least one forensic pathologist has pushed back</a> on the suicide ruling, saying that Epstein’s broken bones were more consistent with a homicide than a suicide.</p>
      <p>Attorney General <b>William Barr </b>moved quickly after Epstein’s Aug. 10 death to make changes at the Bureau of Prisons (BOP). After Epstein died at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, two guards were suspended and a warden <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-49323327">was reassigned</a>. Barr then announced that he was removing the acting director of the BOP <b>Hugh Hurwitz </b>from that role and replacing him with Dr. <b>Kathleen Hawk Sawyer</b>, who served as BOP Director from 1992 to 2003. She was <a href="https://www.wusa9.com/article/news/nation-world/us-prisons-chief-removed-after-jeffrey-epsteins-death/65-d21e7a07-5c12-4fad-a931-deba2f0de0ce">the first woman to lead the BOP</a>.</p>
      <p>The moves were made after Barr expressed his anger and dismay that Epstein was not adequately secured (he was <a href="https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/legal-experts-dumbfounded-by-decision-to-remove-epstein-from-suicide-watch/">taken off of suicide watch </a>after a reported prior suicide attempt). Barr said there<a href="https://time.com/5650117/jeffrey-epstein-prison-irregularities-barr/"> were “serious irregularities”</a> at the jail. The circumstances surrounding Epstein’s death, which <a href="https://lawandcrime.com/high-profile/jeffrey-epsteins-prison-suicide-leaves-law-enforcement-experts-stunned/">law enforcement experts called stunning</a>, remains under investigation by both the FBI and the DOJ’s Inspector General.</p>
      <p>According to the <i>AP’s</i> latest reporting, Hawk Sawyer “disclosed in a Nov. 4 internal memo that a review of operations across the agency found some staff members failed to perform required rounds and inmate counts but logged that they had done so anyway.”</p>
      <p>“Falsification of information in government systems and documents is also a violation of policy, and may be subject to criminal prosecution as well,” the memo said.</p>
      <p>That line of the memo turned out to be pretty telling. <a href="https://apnews.com/38daadad9c054a088fc50a31ad82579c">The on-duty prison guards,</a> who were working overtime, failed to check on Epstein each half hour and were suspected of falsifying logs to indicate otherwise. They now face charges for that.</p>
