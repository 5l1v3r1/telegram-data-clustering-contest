      <p><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/new-delhi">New Delhi </a>has emerged as the 9th fastest growing city globally for luxury residential real estate with a rise of 4.4 per cent in capital values over the past one year, says the latest report by <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/knight-frank">Knight Frank.</a> While <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/new-delhi">New Delhi </a>and Mumbai have moved up by one and two places, respectively, from 10th and 30th ranks in the second quarter of 2019 (Q2-2019), Bengaluru has slipped five places from 15th spot in the second quarter of 2019 to the 20th place in the third quarter of 2019.</p>

      <p>“While Delhi and Mumbai have moved up in their rankings, luxury home prices have remained stable in both the cities in the past three months. Delhi’s prime residential market, which is characterised by its tight supply, had witnessed a growth of 4.4 per cent in March 2019 quarter, leading to this performance in the Prime Global City Index,” said Shishir Baijal, chairman and managing director, Knight Frank India.</p>
      <p>Mumbai, comprising areas such as Cuffe Parade, Napean Sea Road, Colaba, Lower Parel, Worli, Tardeo, Juhu, Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC), Santacruz (W), Bandra (W), Khar (W) and Prabhadevi, registered a 0.8 per cent increase in average capital value to Rs 64,775 per sq. ft.</p>
