      <p>It’s only been two days on I’m a Celebrity but <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/roman-kemp/">Roman Kemp</a> has delivered a story that might be the most 80s tale to ever exist.</p>
      <p>The Capital FM DJ spoke about his godfather, George Michael (might have heard of him) and how he gatecrashed the first date of his parents, Spandau Ballet legend Martin Kemp and Wham! Singer Shirlie Holliman.</p>
      <p>Told you the tale was pretty 80s.</p>
      <p>Roman has been making himself comfy in the I’m a Celebrity camp, and opened up about this music royalty family with the rest of his campmates.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Kate Garraway, who confessed her love of his dad, Roman spoke about how their mum and dad met.</p>
      <p>‘My mother always said that she said to George Michael at a party that she was going to marry [Martin],’ he revealed.</p>

      <p>‘They were at some party and she didn’t want to speak to [Martin] and one of George’s friends brought him over,’ he continued.</p>
      <p>‘They started talking and my dad gave my mum his phone number and my mum went back to George’s house and George forced my mum to call him.’</p>

      <p>While George’s wingman skills are certainly not to be questioned here, he took his duties too far when Shirlie asked him to help out over nerves on the date when Martin finally asked her out.</p>
      <p>‘Their first date, George went with them,’ Roman laughed. ‘My mum didn’t want to go on her own.</p>
      <p>‘They went to see Sade at the Camden Palace. My dad spent the whole date trying to get rid of him!’</p>

      <p>Despite that one faux pas, George’s friendship was clearly important to the Kemp family, and after they got married and had children, George became Roman’s godfather.</p>
      <p>Which for him comes with two major positives – having an absolute legend as a godfather, and getting some killer Christmas gifts every year.</p>
      <p>‘One year, I must have been four or five, and my dad bought me a bike, a Raleigh bike,’ he said.</p>

      <p>‘I remember George came round to the house and brought in my present and he’d gone to Harrods and bought one of those electric cars but not just that… it was a Batmobile! I’ve still got it.’</p>
      <p>‘Memories like that, they’re so nice to have, but it’s strange because for me it was just my mum’s best mate,’ he added of the late star.</p>
