      <p>Some Universal Credit claimants will notice a special <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a> bonus in their bank accounts this winter. </p>
      <p>The one-off payments will appear in the accounts of those claiming certain kinds of benefits.</p>
      <p>Below is everything you need to know about the Christmas Bonus for 2019 - who's eligible, how much it's worth and how to claim.</p>
      <p>Also, find out the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/uk-news/benefit-payments-universal-christmas-2019-17086710">benefit payment dates this Christmas.</a></p>
      <h3>What is the Christmas Bonus?</h3>
      <p>The Christmas Bonus is a one-off £10 payment that will land in the accounts of those eligible to receive it in December.</p>
      <p>The bonus is usually paid in the first week of December, and is given to households claiming specific benefits.</p>
      <h3>Am I eligible to receive the Christmas Bonus?</h3>
      <p>To be eligible for the bonus, you'll need to be claiming one of the following benefits when December pay week falls:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Armed Forces Independence Payment</li>
        <li>Attendance Allowance</li>
        <li>Carer’s Allowance</li>
        <li>Constant Attendance Allowance (paid under Industrial Injuries or War Pensions schemes)</li>
        <li>Contribution-based Employment and Support Allowance (once the main phase of the benefit is entered after the first 13 weeks of claim)</li>
        <li>Disability Living Allowance</li>
        <li>Incapacity Benefit at the long-term rate</li>
        <li>Industrial Death Benefit (for widows or widowers)</li>
        <li>Mobility Supplement</li>
        <li>Pension Credit - the guarantee element</li>
        <li>Personal Independence Payment (PIP)</li>
        <li>State Pension (including Graduated Retirement Benefit)</li>
        <li>Severe Disablement Allowance (transitionally protected)</li>
        <li>Unemployability Supplement or Allowance (paid under Industrial Injuries or War Pensions schemes)</li>
        <li>War Disablement Pension at State Pension age</li>
        <li>War Widow’s Pension</li>
        <li>Widowed Mother’s Allowance</li>
        <li>Widowed Parent’s Allowance</li>
        <li>Widow’s Pension</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Those on <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/universal-credit">Universal Credit</a>  won't be automatically entitled to the bonus, and must meet one of the categories outlined above to receive it.</p>
      <p>Couples who are married, in a civil partnership or are living together will both receive the bonus if they both fall under one of the categories outlined above.</p>
      <h3>How do I claim the Christmas Bonus?</h3>
      <p>If you're eligible, you won't need to do anything as the money will be automatically transferred into the same account that your usual benefits are paid into.</p>
      <p>If you do receive it, the Christmas Bonus may show up with a transaction ID of  'DWP XB'  in your bank account.</p>
      <h3>When does Universal Credit get paid over Christmas?</h3>
      <p>Benefits paid on a bi-weekly basis include support allowance, income support, or jobseekers' allowance.</p>
      <p>Universal Credit and all other benefits are usually paid into accounts every two weeks.</p>
      <p>Due dates differ for each individual, so check if your usual payment date falls on a Wednesday or a Thursday.</p>
      <p>If so your payment should be due on Christmas or Boxing Day, meaning you can expect it to hit your account on Tuesday, December 24.</p>
      <p>If your due date falls on New Year's Day (Wednesday, January 1), you can expect your payment to go in on Tuesday, December 31.</p>
      <h3>Tax Credit payment dates for Christmas and New Year 2019</h3>
      <p>Due date: December 25, 2019 | Actual pay date: December 24</p>
      <p>Due date: December 26, 2019 | Actual pay date: December 24</p>
      <p>Due date: January 1, 2020 | Actual pay date: December 31</p>
      <h3>Child Benefit payment dates for Christmas and New Year 2019</h3>
      <p>The usual pay dates should stay the same, as neither Christmas nor New Year falls on a Monday or a Tuesday (the usual days Child Benefit is paid) this year.</p>
      <p>Child Benefit is usually paid every four weeks in England.</p>
