      <h1>A Yelling Fan Cost a Pro Golfer a Shot At a Tournament Win. His Response Is a Masterful Lesson in Emotional Intelligence</h1>
      <h2>A fan distracted Brandon Matthews as he tried to make a playoff-saving putt. What he did next displayed exceptional empathy and class.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T09:15:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 09:15</time> by <a rel="author">Jeff Haden</a></address>
      <p>Brandon Matthews desperately needed to make his putt. He and Ricardo Celia had finished the <a href="https://www.pgatour.com/la/en/news/2019/11/17/celia-ends-drought--wins-playoff-in-argentina.html">Open de Argentina</a> (Argentine Open) in a tie, forcing extra holes. On the third playoff hole, Celia drained a 30-foot putt.</p>
      <p>Matthews needed to make his to stay alive and extend the two-man playoff to a fourth hole. </p>
      <p>Pressure? Absolutely. Not only was the tournament victory on the line, so was guaranteed entry in next year's Open Championship.</p>
      <p>So he took a deep breath, settled himself, lined up the putt... </p>
      <p>And during his backswing a fan yelled and Matthews, distracted, missed the putt.</p>
      <p>"I got over the putt, took the putter back and heard kind of a yelp or a scream," <a href="https://www.golfchannel.com/news/after-playoff-loss-brandon-matthews-embraces-fan-who-yelled-his-backstroke">Matthews said</a>. "At that stage, any minute noise resonates."</p>
      <p>Matthews naturally assumed the fan had distracted him on purpose; galleries at the Open de Argentina tend to be considerate and respectful. </p>
      <p>"I was obviously frustrated about it," he said. "I gave it a little too much right hand, missed it and turned around and said, 'Come on guys, seriously?!'"</p>
      <p>Celia celebrated on the green. </p>
      <p>Matthews stewed in the locker room... until Claudio Rivas, a PGA tour official, told him the fan who had yelled has Down Syndrome.</p>
      <p>He hadn't tried to distract Matthews; he had just gotten excited. </p>
      <p>Matthews' response? He wanted to meet the fan.</p>
      <p>"I was around mental disability growing up, and I have a soft spot in my heart for it," Matthews said. "Those are really special people. I felt so terrible that I was even upset. I just wanted to make sure that he didn't feel bad."</p>
      <p>Matthews spoke with the fan, gave him a signed golf ball and glove, and gave him a hug.</p>
      <p>As <a href="https://www.golfchannel.com/news/after-playoff-loss-brandon-matthews-embraces-fan-who-yelled-his-backstroke">Matthews said</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>I gave him a hug and I asked him, 'Hey, are you doing OK? Are you having fun?'<br/><br/>I just wanted to make sure he was enjoying himself, that he had no hard feelings, that he didn't feel bad about what happened. I didn't want to anyone to be mad at him. I didn't want him to be mad at himself. I wanted to make sure he knew that I wasn't mad. That's all I wanted to do.<br/><br/>There are some things in life that are just bigger than golf. And this was one of them.</blockquote>

      <p>As my Inc.com colleague Justin Bariso writes, <a href="https://www.inc.com/justin-bariso/what-is-emotional-intelligence-heres-answer-in-1-simple-sentence.html">emotional intelligence is</a> the ability to identify, understand, and effectively manage emotions -- both your own, and those of others. </p>
      <p>Emotional intelligence is the ability to make emotions work for you, instead of against you.</p>
      <p>And to use that ability to not only help yourself, but to help others.</p>
      <p>That's what Matthews did. In the moment, he couldn't control how he felt. He was frustrated and angry -- and it showed.</p>
      <p>But once he had context for what happened, once he understood what happened, and why... he used that knowledge to mange his emotions. </p>
      <p>And to help the fan manage his emotions, an often-forgotten component of emotional intelligence. </p>
      <p>Emotionally intelligent people are socially aware. They're empathetic. They see things from another's perspective.</p>
      <p>Even in the face of crushing disappointment, Matthews was concerned about how the fan felt. He couldn't control or change the result of the tournament -- but he could control how he dealt with the result.</p>
      <p>And Matthews could help the fan deal with his own feelings about what happened.</p>
      <p>Managing your emotions. Making them work for you, not against you. Being empathetic enough to help others do the same.</p>
      <p>If that's not emotionally intelligent... nothing is.</p>
