      <p>Songwon Industrial Co., Ltd. (Ulsan, South Korea; <a href="http://www.songwon.com/">www.songwon.com</a>), the second largest manufacturer of polymer stabilizers in the world and a key global player in the polyvinyl chloride (PVC) stabilizer industry since 1965, has entered into a strategic co-operation agreement with JiangSu Uniwel Chemistry Co., Ltd., effective as of July 2019, to meet the ever-increasing need for PVC stabilizers. Both Songwon and Uniwel will develop and manufacture the products, which will be sold under the companies’ respective brand names.</p>
      <p>“This partnership will provide us with immediate access to state-of-the-art production of liquid and solid mixed-metal stabilizers and competitive Chinese raw materials,” says Philippe Schlaepfer, executive vice president, Performance Chemicals Division, at Songwon. He continues: “We will retain PVC-stabilizer production in South Korea, and be able to cover rising demand, especially in South-East and South Asia. As a global leader in tin stabilizers, catalysts and intermediates as well as PVC stabilizers, Songwon will also continue to serve these markets via the Korean site.”</p>
      <p>“With more than 25 years of experience in the field, Uniwel has become a leading supplier of PVC stabilizers in China,” says Mr. Jiang, president of Uniwel. “We are therefore well-placed to manufacture high-quality products for Songwon and looking forward to our cooperation.”</p>
      <p>Uniwel produces a broad range of PVC heat stabilizers for a wide variety of end products, including window profiles, pipes &amp; pipe fittings, indoor decoration boards, rigid foam boards, stone-plastic-composite floorings, films, leathers, wires &amp; cables and much more. With their excellent heat stability and processability, strong adaptability and suitability for numerous processing techniques, Uniwel stabilizers provide PVC with outstanding physical and mechanical properties, says the company.</p>
      <p>Uniwel has acquired a number of invention and utility model patents and its six major ranges, which use advanced chemical technology to provide high-performance products for PVC, have all received high-technology awards.</p>
      <p>“With the combined strengths of our two companies, we will be able to meet customer demand and requirements now and in the future,” concludes Schlaepfer.</p>
