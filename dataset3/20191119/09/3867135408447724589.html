      <p>MONROE — The magnitude <a href="https://www.heraldnet.com/news/early-wake-up-call-twin-quakes-in-monroe-rattle-region/">4.6 Monroe earthquake</a> felt by thousands of Puget Sound-area residents in July is helping scientists assess how future quakes will impact the region.</p>
      <p>The relatively tame event was serendipitous for a group of scientists from Harvard, the University of Washington and the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network.</p>
      <p>Just over a week before the earthquake hit, the group placed seismometers throughout the Seattle-Tacoma area to record how background noises like traffic or swaying trees interacted with the area’s geology.</p>
      <p>The scientists planned to study the Seattle and Tacoma sedimentary basins — depressions filled with soft sediment, rather than rock — to learn more about how they’re shaped.</p>
      <p>But when the Monroe earthquake hit, they got more data than they bargained for.</p>
      <p>Seattle, Tacoma and Everett all lie within some of Puget Sound’s largest basins. These areas magnify how much the ground shakes in an earthquake.</p>
      <p>“You can think of a basin as a bowl of Jello-O,” said Alex Hutko, a project lead with the Seismic Network.</p>
      <p>If the bowl is shaking, the stack of Jell-O inside it shakes even more.</p>
      <p>Everett’s basin is centered under Hat Island in Possession Sound and extends north to Marysville, east to Granite Falls and west past Whidbey Island.</p>
      <p>With the data retrieved during the Monroe earthquake, U.S. Geological Survey geophysicist Erin Wirth said scientists are now able to study just how much basins amplify ground shaking.</p>
      <p>The amount a basin increases shaking is the same regardless of an earthquake’s magnitude, so the data will help them determine how future, bigger quakes will impact Puget Sound’s urban areas, Wirth said.</p>
      <p>But each basin is unique. The Seattle Basin won’t magnify shaking the same way Everett’s will.</p>
      <p>Scientists are still combing through the data, and results won’t be published for months to a year. In the meantime, Wirth said, they’re learning just how crucial it is to know how urban basins will respond to larger-magnitude earthquakes.</p>
      <p>The amplification will affect tall structures the most, she said, so the research could inform how buildings are built to withstand shaking.</p>
      <p>“This has driven home the need to have these (instruments) in these basins permanently,” Wirth said.</p>
