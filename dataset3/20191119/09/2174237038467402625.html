      <p><a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/hollywood-vampires-the-unlikeliest-soberest-supergroup-ever">Hollywood Vampires</a> have announced a European tour which will take place in August and September 2020.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/every-alice-cooper-album-ranked-from-worst-to-best">Alice Cooper</a>, <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/heavy-load-joe-perry">Joe Perry</a> and <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/johnny-depp-is-just-killing-time-until-his-band-gets-back-together">Johnny Depp</a> will play a total of 11 shows in support of their latest studio album <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/reviews/hollywood-vampires-rise-album-review"><i>Rise</i></a>, which launched back in June through earMUSIC.</p>
      <p>And to mark the announcement, the band have released a video for their <i>Rise</i> track <i>I Want My Now</i>, which features live footage cut with backstage film.</p>
      <p>Speaking about the follow-up to their <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/reviews/hollywood-vampires-hollywood-vampires">self-titled 2015 album</a>, <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/aerosmith-a-guide-to-their-best-albums">Aerosmith</a> guitarist Perry said: “<i>Rise</i> came from pure creative energy, which is just like playing live with the Vampires. The record showcases everyone doing what they do best without anyone looking over our shoulders. </p>
      <p>“There was no pressure or deadlines, allowing us to write and record an album that is one of the freest and most honest sounding records I’ve been part of.”</p>
      <p>Tickets will go on general sale this coming Friday (November 22) along with VIP packages which will include meet and greet opportunities.</p>
