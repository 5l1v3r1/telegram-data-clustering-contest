      <h3>Just days after launch.</h3>
      <p>A modder has added cut Pokemon to Nintendo’s <i><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/pokemon-sword-and-shield/">Pokemon Sword and Shield</a> </i>just days after launch.</p>
      <p>Modder ScriesM has taken to Twitter to show cut Pokemon Omastar inside <i>Sword and Shield </i>after importing the character’s model from the Switch’s <a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/pokemon-lets-go/"><i>Pokemon Let’s Go</i></a>.</p>

      <p>ScriesM confirmed that “obviously stats are broken (didn’t fix the personal entry yet), and this was originally an edited yamper that I didn’t bother giving legitimate moves,” later further clarifying “yamper is still in the game with this edit. This is a new entry inserted into the model table using Omastar’s species ID (139). The one in my party/shown in battle was a yamper that I just lazily edited the species of with PKHeX.”</p>
      <p>The modder concluded that “bringing back old pokemon seems hard but doable to me.”</p>
      <p>It’s been a rough start for <a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/pokemon-sword-and-shield/"><i>Pokemon Sword and Shield</i></a>, with <a href="https://stevivor.com/news/future-pokemon-games-will-also-feature-reduced-pokedex/">Game Freak recently confirming it and future titles will run with a cut back Pokedex</a>. Fans are also <a href="https://stevivor.com/news/gamefreaklied-trending-alleged-3ds-switch-model-comparison/">insistent that Game Freak has re-used old 3DS character models in this new Switch game</a>.</p>
