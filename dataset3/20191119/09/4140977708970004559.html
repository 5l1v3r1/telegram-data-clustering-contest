                      <h3>Eden Hazard issues response to Arsene Wenger’s overweight criticism</h3>
                      <p>Eden Hazard has claimed that he is in good shape despite the criticism aimed at him. In an interview with SkySports, Hazard said:</p>
                      <p>
                        <i>“For the last month I’ve been in good condition with no injuries.”</i>
                      </p>

                          <p>
                            <i>“I’m in good shape. When I’m on the pitch I will always try to do my best, with Real Madrid or Belgium. I just want to keep this momentum.” </i>
                          </p>

                            <p>Eden Hazard starred in Belgium’s 4-1 win over Russia in the Euro 2020 qualifying match by scoring two goals. Hazard will look to add to his tally when Belgium face Cyprus in their final game. With Belgium already qualified, this match is only off academic interest. Although, to Hazard, this is an opportunity to party with the fans.</p>
                            <p><i>“It’s good to play our last game at home, especially when you have qualified already,” </i>Hazard added.<i> “You have nothing to play, but you hope for a party with the fans against Cyprus.</i></p>
                            <p>
                              <i>“We had a problem with winning away so it won’t be easy but hopefully we can score some goals, keep a clean sheet and keep the fans happy.”</i>
                            </p>
                            <p>Eden Hazard joined Chelsea for £32m from Lille in 2012. He made 352 appearances for Chelsea, scoring 110 goals. Hazard won two Premier League titles, two Europa Leagues, the FA Cup and League Cup during his time at Stamford Bridge. Real Madrid next play Real Sociedad when La Liga returns at the weekend.</p>
