      <h1>Quality Street's personalisation service coming to Bristol as it tours the country</h1>
      <h2>The offer is free with the purchase of a 1kg Quality Street tin</h2>

      <p>There's just five weeks to go until Christmas Day which means festive shopping has started in earnest.</p>
      <p>And for those stuck when it comes to stocking fillers, or just want to treat someone they love in the run-up to <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas</a>, the personalised Quality Street tins are proving a big hit.</p>
      <p>So far this year they have only been available in branches of <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/john-lewis">John Lewis</a>, including the <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/cribbs-causeway">Cribbs Causeway</a> store, but for one weekend only a pop-up personalisation service will be coming to Bristol.</p>
      <p>Touring the country, visiting 16 branches of <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/sainsburys">Sainsbury's</a>, next weekend (Nov 30- Dec 1) will be the turn of Castle Court, in St Philips Causeway.</p>
      <p>To customise their tin, customers just need to choose a name or word - maximum of nine letters - which will be laser-engraved on the lid while they wait.</p>
      <p>The offer is free with the purchase of a 1kg Quality Street tin.</p>
      <p>Ellie Worley, senior brand manager for Quality Street, said: “Our much-loved Quality Street brand is all about bringing families and friends together. Sharing Quality Street favourites at Christmas is a festive tradition – now we’re offering the chance to make the tins unique and collectible too.</p>
      <p>“Whether you choose to customise your tin with your name, that of a loved one or even your own street, we’re delighted to be partnering with Sainsbury’s again so that fans can pick up a personalised tin along with their weekly shop.”</p>
