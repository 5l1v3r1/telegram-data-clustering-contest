      <p>SEATTLE (AP) — A supervisor for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives in Seattle is receiving a $450,000 settlement after complaining of racial harassment from a co-worker with a Nazi tattoo.</p>
      <p>The Seattle Times <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/atf-pays-450000-to-settle-discrimination-lawsuit-involving-a-boss-with-a-nazi-tattoo/">reports</a> Cheryl Bishop, a senior supervisory agent who is black, complained of harassment from Bradley Devlin, the bureau’s resident agent in charge in Eugene, Oregon.</p>
      <p>Devlin has a “German Eagle SS Lightning bolt” tattoo he says he got infiltrating a white supremacist biker gang in Ohio.</p>
      <p>Bishop sued the ATF in 2018, saying the agency retaliated and scuttled her appointment to work at headquarters after she filed a discrimination complaint against Devlin.</p>
      <p>Devlin said in court documents he is not racist and called Bishop’s complaints absurd.</p>
      <p>He described their conflict as based on personality, not race.</p>
