      <h1>First Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order Update released, addresses texture flickering &amp; loading times</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T09:58:54+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 09:58</time> by <a rel="author">John Papadopoulos</a></address>
      <p>Respawn has released the first update for Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order in just under three days. This patch is 550MB in size on the PC, and addresses the texture flickering issues while driving the AT-AT on Kashyyyk.</p>
      <p>Moreover, this patch addresses the slow loading times that players have reported. Unfortunately, though, there is no word on whether this update resolves the stuttering issues from which all versions suffer. Also, and apart from addressing the aforementioned flickering issues, there is no word on whether it will fix some texture streaming issues.</p>
      <p>But anyway, this patch also improves the responsiveness of the input from the arrow keys within menus. Furthermore, it brings improvements to the dynamic resolution settings.</p>
      <p>As always, Origin will download this patch the next time you launch its launcher. Below you can also find its key features.</p>
