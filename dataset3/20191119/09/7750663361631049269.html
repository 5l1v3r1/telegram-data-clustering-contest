      <h1>Age Hareide: 'Denmark lucky to get away with draw against Ireland'</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/age-hareide/"><b>Age Hareide</b></a> has tipped the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/republic-of-ireland/"><b>Republic of Ireland</b></a> to join <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/denmark/"><b>Denmark</b></a> at the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/euro-2020/"><b>Euro 2020</b></a> finals after seeing his side edge across the finishing line in Dublin.</h2>

      <p>A 1-1 draw at the Aviva Stadium on Monday evening was enough to send the Danes through automatically at Ireland's expense, leaving <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mick-mccarthy/"><b>Mick McCarthy</b></a>'s men to fight it out in next March's play-offs.</p>
      <p>However, Hareide admitted his team was fortunate to emerge with the point they needed on a night when the Republic threatened to secure their first competitive win over Denmark since 1979.</p>

      <p>He said: "We didn't play well and are lucky to get away with a draw. Ireland played well and if they keep going like that, they will probably come through the Nations League play-offs and qualify."</p>
      <p>Hareide's comments may come as little comfort to his opposite number, who saw his team turn in arguably their best performance of the Group D campaign when they needed it most, but ultimately fail to find the cutting edge to make it count.</p>
      <p>They fell behind to Martin Braithwaite's 73rd-minute strike, which came against the run of play, but ensured that the result remained in doubt all the way to the whistle when full-back Matt Doherty levelled with five minutes of normal time remaining.</p>
      <p>Asked what he thought of the performance, McCarthy said: "I said before the game if they leave everything on the pitch and give everything for me, I would take that, so I've got to take the result.</p>
      <p>"I'm disappointed with that, but that is the only thing I am disappointed with in the whole week.</p>

      <p>"How many goals have we scored, seven? Out of eight games? That's quite clearly not clinical enough. But we don't get beat in too many games, and maybe a bit of luck, a bounce of the ball at the end, we nick it.</p>
      <p>"Who knows? Had we nicked it, we'd have deserved it."</p>
      <p>Ireland will discover on Tuesday who their semi-final opponents will be – Slovakia and Wales seem the most likely candidates – but McCarthy is confident they will give anyone a game if they play as they did against the Danes.</p>
      <p>He said: "I have three months to prepare for that. We'll see who we get and I'll plan for it when we get it.</p>
      <p>"If we play the way we are playing and play as well as that against other teams, we can beat them."</p>
