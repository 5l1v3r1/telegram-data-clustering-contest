        <b>Manchester United are reportedly hoping that Mauricio Pochettino is sacked by Tottenham for one very good reason.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Argentine has been under pressure since the start of the season after a poor start to the new campaign.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/tottenham-hotspur"><b>Spurs</b></a> have been wildly inconsistent, with two strong showings in the Champions League against Red Star recently not hiding the fact that they currently sit 14th in the Premier League table with just 14 points from their 12 games so far.</p>
      <p>Rumours have been circulating that <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/tag/mauricio-pochettino"><b>Pochettino</b></a> could be on the brink of the sack in north London, something that was unthinkable when he guided the club to their first Champions League final back in June.</p>
      <p>But with <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/redknapp-urges-pochettino-to-wield-the-axe-on-wantaway-star-eriksen"><b>several star men looking to leave on free transfers next summer</b></a>, the harmony in the Spurs squad has clearly been affected and Pochettino has admitted that he needs to rebuild to challenge regularly for the top four again.</p>

      <p>Despite his struggles this season, the former Southampton boss is still regarded as one of the top managers in European football, with United, Bayern Munich and Real Madrid all known to be admirers.</p>
      <p>And according to <i>The Sun</i>, all three clubs are hoping that Pochettino is shown the door so that they do not have to fork out the Â£30million in compensation that Daniel Levy would demand if the Argentine wanted to leave of his own accord.</p>
      <p>United have had a recent upturn in form under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer but are only ever a few bad results away from calls for the Norwegian to be replaced, while Bayern are chasing a new boss after Niko Kovac was sacked and reports claim that Real chiefs are not convinced that Zinedine Zidane is their best long-term option.</p>
