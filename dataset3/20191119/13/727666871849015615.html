      <p>The star of the upcoming movie 'The Photograph' portrays CTG as Sambo.</p>
      <p><b>(AllHipHop News)</b> Lakeith Stanfield and Charlamagne Tha God are officially in a rap beef. The <i>Atlanta</i> actor dropped a diss track directed at the Power 105.1 radio show host.</p>
      <p>Stanfield fired the first shot when he posted on Instagram that <i>The Breakfast Club </i>and several other media outlets were "anti-black." Charlamagne responded by blasting Lakeith during his "Donkey of the Day" segment.</p>
      <p>"Lakeith Stanfield, don't you ever fix your raggedy-ass mouth to call the author of <i>Black Privilege - </i>because I truly believe it is a privilege to be Black - anti-Black," stated the South Carolina native on November 14.</p>
      <p>Two days later, Stanfield released a tune titled "Automatic" which calls out Charlamagne. The song's cover art depicts CTG as a "Black Sambo" character à la "Mantan" in Spike Lee's 2000 satirical film <i>Bamboozled</i>. </p>
