        <b>Robbie Henshaw is looking forward to a hectic few weeks, starting with Leinster's first away trip of the Heineken European Champions Cup this weekend in Lyon. </b>
      </p>
      <p>The away day in France marks the start of a busy period for the province that includes three interprovincial derbies and three rounds in Europe before Little Christmas.</p>
      <p>Centre Robbie Henshaw got back to work a little earlier than expected against Treviso last Saturday. The Buccaneers club man was making a first appearance since the disappointment of the Rugby World Cup.</p>

      <p>Henshaw says getting out on the pitch for the upcoming busy period is the best way to get over the disappointment in Japan.</p>
      <p>"I think it's about 8 or 10 games back to back now. It's full all-hands-on-deck so it's the best way.</p>
      <p>"I suppose the best way to get over a disappointment is just to get back on the pitch and roll your sleeves up and get going again.</p>
      <p>"I think that will be the mindset for a lot of the players returning. It's just getting back and enjoy your work.</p>
      <p>"Enjoy being back to work in our province, enjoying the lads' company. It's just positive and moving forward.</p>
      <h3>Preparation</h3>
      <p>Despite the last-minute change of plans for Henshaw and being named on the bench after Joe Tomane was ruled out, the Ireland star was happy with his preparation.</p>
      <p>"I was good come Tuesday, I was training with the boys. It was good to get  15-20 minutes under the belt, good to be back in the RDS in front of a home crowd.</p>
      <p>The bonus-point win was a perfect way to start the European campaign said Henshaw:</p>
      <p>"It's a good way to get the ball rolling for us, just to have the whole group back together.</p>
      <p>"We'd been back training about a week before that, so everyone was back on the same page.</p>
      <p>The centre, who came on for Rory O'Loughlin after 63 minutes, was pleased with the team's reward:</p>
      <p>"To put the hard work we've put in over the last few weeks (materialise) on the pitch on Saturday was brilliant.</p>
      <p>"I think Bennetton were always going to be a tricky side. They have improved a massive amount over the last few seasons.</p>
      <p>"They showed that and fought to the bitter end.</p>
      <p>"For us, it was a good physical challenge and it's just good to build momentum coming into the season."</p>
      <h3>Lyon</h3>
      <p>The trip to the Stade de Gerland should see Henshaw get more pitch time this weekend, he admits it's an exciting prospect.</p>
      <p>"Away days in France are always a massive challenge, so I think everyone's we're going to be on our work this week.</p>
      <p>"We had a glance at Lyon over that last few weeks. We've seen they are a tricky side and they are top of the French league at the moment.</p>
      <p>"They have great quality individuals and play a good brand of running rugby."</p>
      <p>After the perfect opening chapter in round one of the pool games, Henshaw knows this weekend will be very different:</p>
      <p>"Playing away on French soil is always tough because the crowd is always on top of you, it just feels different."</p>
