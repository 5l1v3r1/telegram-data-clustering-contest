      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/mcdonalds">McDonald's</a> Ireland has launched its new festive menu and the highly-anticipated Matchmakers Cool Mint McFlurry is sure to be a hit with customers.</p>
      <p>The ice-cream treat consists of soft dairy ice cream swirled with Matchmakers, topped with a chocolate mint sauce and is available in mini and regular sizes.</p>
      <p>The fast food giant is also encouraging customers to embrace the spirit of sharing with their Cheese Melt Dippers Sharebox.</p>
      <p>Bound to be a big hit with cheese-lovers, the Cheese Dippers are made with Camembert and come with a tomato dip.</p>

      <p>Among the other tasty treats making a return to McDonald's restaurants are the Big Tasty® and Big Tasty with Bacon®, along with the all-new Chicken Deluxe with a zesty tomato relish.</p>
      <p>The festive fare will be available in stores from Wednesday, November 20.</p>
      <p>Ben Fox, Marketing Director, McDonald’s UK and Ireland said: “We’re all about making people’s lives easier at Christmas and having familiar favourites like the Big Tasty and Matchmakers McFlurry on menus does just that, when the festive season can feel so chaotic.</p>
      <p>"For 2019 we are excited to be combining these firm favourites with the all-new Chicken Deluxe too - a delicious new addition to the menu which we know our customers will love."</p>
