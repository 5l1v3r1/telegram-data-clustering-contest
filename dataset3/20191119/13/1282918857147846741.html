      <p>The next Samsung Galaxy S phone, likely to be called the Galaxy S11, is rumoured to pack a whopping 108MP camera and support for 8K video recording and now it seems it may also pack a bunch of new camera modes. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/samsung-camera-directors-view-night-hyperlapse-single-take-photo-vertical-panorama-custom-filters/">Folks at XDA-developers</a> have unearthed a slew of information buried in the beta code of Samsung’s in-house camera app. Be that as it may, because we’re dealing with beta code here, not everything reported is expected to come as is on the next high-end Samsung Galaxy S phone. </p>
      <h3>Samsung Galaxy S11 camera modes leak</h3>
      <p>As mentioned earlier, Samsung is said to be working on a bunch of new camera modes that should theoretically debut in Galaxy S11. These include “Director’s View, Night Hyperlapse, Single Take Photo, Vertical Panorama, and custom filters.” </p>
      <p>While Director’s View is said to allow users to access multiple cameras and switch between them while recording video, Night Hyperlapse is presumably hyperlapse with some sort of night mode thrown in. Single Take Photo is said to allow users to simply pan their phone around for 15 seconds as it shoots a series of photos and short videos, while custom filters will reportedly allow users to turn their captured stills into filters. Vertical Panorama is meanwhile said to allow for, well as the name suggests, vertical rather than just horizontal panoramas. </p>
      <p>With the iPhone finally catching up with the Google Pixel in photography in more ways than one this year, Samsung clearly needs the next Galaxy S phone to deliver on that front. While the rumoured 108MP camera and Samsung’s seemingly under-the-works camera modes do sound exciting, only time will tell how good they are in real world usage. More details are awaited. </p>
      <p>Elsewhere, the Galaxy S11 is also rumoured to come in three sizes and as many as five variants, according to serial tipster Evan Blass. Additionally, the top-tier Galaxy S11+ may come in only 5G. Samsung is expected to launch the Galaxy S11 in February 2020. </p>
