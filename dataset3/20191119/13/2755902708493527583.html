      <h1>Illegal Forex Dealers Now Paying “CHEGUMI” Daily To ZRP Officers So That They Don’t Get Busted</h1>

      <p>Illegal forex dealers in the capital city have claimed that they are now being forced to pay daily protection fees to police officers so that they can operate in peace. The forex dealers have termed the daily protection fee “Chegumi” meaning Tithe. The amount for the Tithe demanded by the police officers is typically US$5 per day.</p>
      <p>One of the dealers who spoke to the <a href="https://zimmorningpost.com/rogue-zrp-officers-charging-protection-fees-for-illegal-forex-dealers/">Zimbabwe Morning Post</a> told the publication,</p>
      <aside>I make sure every morning I give them US$5 for me to operate my business freely and to avoid my customers being harassed. Without paying, one risks losing their money and going to prison.<br/>“The system is well choreographed; they have allocated themselves positions around the CBD and know exactly which team operates around the Copacabana area, Fourth Street or Gulf areas. This is more of a cartel within the police force. Once you pay a service fee (mutero/chegumi), you will be free for the day and no one will arrest you, neither will your customers be harassed.</aside>
      <p>The dealers stressed that if they did not play ball with the police, they would be arrested as punishment for not acknowledging the ‘protection’ they received from the police. A dealer who narrated her ordeal at the hands of these rogue police officers told the publication,</p>
      <aside>Once you are arrested, they won’t take you to a police station, rather to some secret places, alleys popularly know as mukoto, where they will count your money and you will be forced to split with the team all the money that will have been confiscated.<br/>In some cases, if you are caught by one or two officers, we pay them ZWL150 or ZWL300, depending with the rank of the officer.</aside>
      <p>When reached for comment, ZRP national spokesperson Assistant Commissioner Paul Nyathi said the police would launch investigations and urged members of the public as well as forex dealers to report the corrupt officers. Said Nyathi,</p>
      <aside>The public should report any demand of bribery from our officers as we cannot just investigate without a report. Many people have claimed that there are corrupt elements within the police force but very few want to report those occurrences, and we end up having few prosecutions.</aside>
      <p>President Emmerson Mnangagwa’s has previously threatened to go tough on the illegal forex dealers and even passed a law which would<a href="https://iharare.com/illegal-money-changers/"> see dealers getting 10 years in prison and losing all their money to the state</a>.  However, that does not seem to have deterred the dealers.</p>
