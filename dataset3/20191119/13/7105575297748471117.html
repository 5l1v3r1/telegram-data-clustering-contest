      <h1>Bella Hadid Reportedly "Went Out of Her Way" to Reach Out to Selena Gomez After Instagram Deletion Drama</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:08:06+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:08</time> by <a rel="author">Alyssa Bailey</a></address>
      <p>Selena Gomez <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29835076/selena-gomez-bella-hadid-instagram-comment-drama-response/">made clear</a> on Instagram yesterday that there really is no drama between her and Bella Hadid after <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29819563/selena-gomez-bella-hadid-instagram-comment/">Hadid deleted a post</a> Gomez commented on and got the attention of fans and media for doing so over the weekend. But there's a backstory that led to Gomez making her final statement defending Hadid: <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/18/bella-hadid-selena-gomez-instagram-deletion-no-feud/">TMZ</a> reports the two privately talked things out.</p>
      <p>Multiple sources connected to Hadid told the outlet that the model "actually went out of her way to reach out to Selena this weekend to squash any potential beef." Gomez and Hadid had public drama in 2017 when Gomez started dating Hadid's ex-boyfriend The Weeknd. Both women <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/news/a44029/selena-gomez-the-weeknd-unfollow-bella-hadid-on-instagram/">unfollowed each other on Instagram</a> and got the attention of fans and the media for doing so. Gomez and The Weeknd <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a12115489/selena-gomez-and-the-weeknd-relationship-timeline/">broke up</a> in October 2017.</p>
      <p>This November, Gomez <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29702891/selena-gomez-bella-hadid-instagram-refollowing/">re-followed Hadid</a> on Instagram. She commented "Stunning üòç" on one of Hadid's Instagrams this weekend, Hadid took the post down shortly after, and when a Selena Gomez Instagram fan account pointed out Hadid deleted the Instagram, Gomez commented "That sucks üò¢"</p>

      <p>TMZ's sources said the two chatted after Hadid took the post down when there was speculation it could be a jab at Gomez. It wasn't. "Bella told Selena it was never about taking a shot, the model simply deleted because she didn't like the pic," TMZ wrote its sources informed them.</p>

      <p>After their conversation, Gomez commented a second time on a fan account's Instagram to explain she never should have spoken out without getting Hadid's side of the story and implored fans to not bully Hadid. "I shouldn't of spoken without knowing the truth. I'm sorry," Gomez wrote. "Please don't be hurtful. She is a wonderful person, and it was all a misunderstanding."</p>
