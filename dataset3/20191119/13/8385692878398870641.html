      <p>Amazon has a <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/best-cell-phone-deals">great deal</a> on the <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2019/11/top-10-reasons-roborock-is-better-than-irobot-roomba.html">Roborock E35 robot vacuum</a> and mop today. Bringing the price down to just $239.99 in its Gold Box Deal of the Day. But there is also a 5-percent off coupon you can clip on the page, dropping it even further to just $227.99. Now that is an all-time low price for this robot vacuum.</p>
      <p>The Roborock E35 is a really good robot vacuum, even for its regular price of $349. Now that it is just $228, it makes it an absolute steal. But remember, this price is going to be good today only, and will expire at midnight.</p>
      <p>The E35 is great because it uses a dual-gyro system to map out your home and navigate around everything. Instead of using lasers like the S-series from Roborock uses. This means that it is still precise about where it has cleaned and where it still needs to clean. Without worrying about it missing a spot.</p>

      <p>This also sports some really strong suction, we're talking about 2000Pa. That is strong enough to pick up a AAA battery. So yeah, it's going to get up all of that dirt around your home. On top of that, it's going to be great at getting up all of that pet hair from your dogs and cats in your home. Making it a really great robot vacuum for pet owners.</p>
      <p>Finally, the Roborock also supports Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant. This allows you to ask your favorite assistant to tell Roborock to start cleaning. It's a really cool feature to use with a robot vacuum. Especially if you've spilled something and still have your hands full, really great while you're cooking Thanksgiving Dinner.</p>
