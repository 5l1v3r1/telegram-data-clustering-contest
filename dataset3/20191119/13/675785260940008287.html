      <p>Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn have spent the day preparing for their first TV debate - in very different ways.</p>
      <p>As the Prime Minister got into a boxing ring this afternoon while on a visit to Manchester, Corbyn took a more relaxed approach and headed for a "quick trim" at the barbers.</p>
      <p>The Labour leader took to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> where he uploaded a clip of him in the barber shop chair, captioning it: "Quick trim before the first TV debate of the #GE2019. You can watch it tonight at 8pm on ITV. #RealChange."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile on his visit to the Manchester boxing gym, Boris said he "loves" the sport.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister entered the ring with the head coach of Jimmy Egan's Boxing Academy in Wythenshawe to practice his punches.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson, who removed his suit jacket and rolled up his sleeves for the occasion, donned a navy blue pair of "Get Brexit Done" gloves in the ring.</p>

      <p>The PM said he should not be "aggressive" and instead said it was "more therapeutic boxing" as he joked about punching photographers on the side.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson left the ring as two more serious boxers entered, saying he would "quit while he's ahead".</p>
      <p>Steve Egan, the boxing coach who sparred with the Prime Minister in the ring, told PA news agency Mr Johnson was "strong" but a "bit rusty".</p>
      <p>Tonight's debate will be hosted by ITV regular host  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/julie-etchingham">Julie Etchingham</a> , who previously hosted the Conservative party leader debate between Johnson and  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-hunt">Jeremy Hunt</a>  .</p>
      <p>Corbyn and Johnson will each have a minute for opening statements and then 45 seconds for closing statements, but in between they will be asked questions from ITV viewers from varying political beliefs and socio-economic backgrounds.</p>
      <p>It is the first time the leaders of the two main parties have squared off since 2015 - and it is set to be dramatic.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a>  , the NHS, the economy, relations with the US, and each of the pair's own personal leadership troubles will likely be up for debate.</p>
      <p>The Lib Dems and  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/snp">SNP</a>  took legal action against ITV for keeping them out of its first debate. - but lost their court battle yesterday.</p>
      <p>Two leading judges ruled there was "no arguable breach of the Broadcasting Code".</p>
      <p>Lord Justice Davis, sitting with Mr Justice Warby, said: "The clear conclusion of both members of this court is that, viewed overall, these claims are not realistically arguable.</p>

      <p>"It follows that the television debate scheduled for tomorrow evening between the leader of the Conservative Party and the leader of the  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a>  Party may lawfully go ahead."</p>
      <p>ITV said that following the debate between <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a> it will broadcast a live programme where Jo Swinson, Nicola Sturgeon, Nigel Farage and Sian Berry will be interviewed in consecutive face-to-face interviews.</p>
      <p>Scottish First Minister Ms Sturgeon said last week that it is "fundamentally unfair" for other parties to be cut out of the debate.</p>
      <p>Sky News has proposed a November 28 date for its debate, while the BBC has confirmed it will host two debates, on November 29 and December 6, in addition to a series of Question Time specials.</p>
