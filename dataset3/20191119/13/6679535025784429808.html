      <h1>Lake View Road cries for an overhaul</h1>
      <h2>Residents complain that the stretch has remained so bad for long</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:42:07+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/B-Tilak-Chandar-11449/" target="_blank">B. Tilak Chandar</a></address>
      <p>Madurai</p>
      <p>Lake View Road at K.K. Nagar that connects Mattuthavani with Anna Nagar has turned into an arterial road.</p>
      <p>People travelling to the southern districts of Sivaganga, Ramanathapuram, Thoothukudi and Tirunelveli use this stretch. However, the road has turned nightmarish for vehicle users. Riddled with potholes and dust, the road has become difficult to use, complain vehicle users.</p>
      <p>The residents of K.K. Nagar complain that for long the road has remained in such a bad state. Repair works were carried out by the Corporation on several occasions.</p>
      <p>However, they have not been fruitful as the potholes on the road have returned, they say.</p>
      <p>The Lake View Garden Residents’ Welfare Association, which held a residents’ meeting recently, has passed a resolution to take up the issue with the Corporation.</p>
      <p>Pointing out the increase in the number of people using the road, advocate Thirumurugan, who resides in K.K. Nagar, said that there are hospitals, schools and other commercial establishments nearby.</p>
      <p>Also, a large number of people, including the elderly and children, visit the Vandiyur tank. Yoga, silambam and skating classes are being conducted for children in the park.</p>
      <p>When this is the case, the authorities concerned have to address the issue promptly.</p>
      <p>Also, the recent rains have exposed the shoddy repair works on the road.</p>
      <p>The potholes have come back and people find it difficult to use, especially, when they are filled with rainwater. When we pay road tax we expect the government to ensure good quality roads, he says.</p>
      <p>Overflowing garbage bins have added to the problem. Instead of indulging in blame game, the authorities should deploy more personnel in thickly populated wards and ensure cleanliness, he adds.</p>
      <p>K.P. Samuel, a retired teacher, says that several petitions have already been submitted to the Corporation Commissioner.</p>
      <p>However, he says that the issue has not been addressed and if at all repair works are being carried out, they are just for namesake and the problems return. Even the inner roads are in a bad state. Mere filling the potholes with gravel has not addressed the issue, he complains.</p>
      <p>The residents of the area have come together and a meeting on the problems has been held recently. The bad state of Lake View Road and the inner roads have been discussed. Also, the residents have faced problems during the recent rains which have left the roads clogged.</p>
      <p>“We have decided to hold another meeting and then petition the Corporation to look into our problems”, says S. Kanagavel Manoharan, president, Lake View Garden Residents’ Welfare Association.</p>
      <p>“I have been using the road for over 20 years. Houses and commercial establishments have mushroomed along the road and with the opening of the central market, traffic on the road has certainly increased”, says S. Selva Gomathi, Managing Trustee, Justice Shivaraj V. Patil Foundation.</p>
      <p>However, the condition of the road for long has remained bad. Recently a lorry has got stuck after the road has been dug up for some civic works, throwing traffic out of gear.</p>
      <p>She laments that the road has been dug up by various departments for providing different amenities. They should work in tandem and ensure public money is not wasted, she says.</p>
      <p>She adds that in the absence of elected civic body members, people do not know whom to approach to redress their grievances.</p>
      <p>Complaining about the pathetic state of the road, two-wheeler riders say that this has also led to health issues.</p>
      <p>“We have to manoeuvre the potholes on the road, which leads to severe backpain,” says S. Murugan, a two-wheeler rider, who frequents the road.</p>
      <p>He adds that whenever it rains, the width of the road reduces due to water stagnation on the sides, and there should be a proper mechanism to drain rainwater.</p>
      <p>When asked about the state of the road, Corporation officials say that they have received complaints from the residents. We will be addressing the issue soon.</p>
      <p>“We will take measures to see that the potholes are filled. First, we’ll will be doing temporary patch works to address the issue as an urgent measure.”</p>
