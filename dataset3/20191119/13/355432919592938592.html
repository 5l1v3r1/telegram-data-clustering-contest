      <h1>Majority of Democrats emphasize electability in 2020 candidate: poll</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:08:59+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/rachel-frazin" target="_blank">Rachel Frazin</a></address>
      <p>A majority of voters who identify as Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say they would want the party's nominee to be someone who has the best chance of defeating <a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a> rather than one who most closely aligns with them on the issues, a new poll has found. </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/268448/democrats-thinking-strategically-2020-nominee-choice.aspx?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=morelink&amp;utm_campaign=syndication">Gallup survey released Tuesday</a> found that 60 percent of Democrats and Democratic leaners said that they would prefer a candidate who has the best chance of beating Trump compared to 38 percent who said they would prefer a candidate who agrees with them on most issues they care about.  </p>
      <p>The survey also found that out of a series of top contenders, former Vice President <a href="https://thehill.com/people/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a> was perceived as having the best chance to beat the president. </p>
      <p>A total of 51 percent said Biden has the best chance to beat Trump, while 16 percent said Sen. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/bernie-sanders">Bernie Sanders</a> (I-Vt.) has the best chance to beat him. Fifteen percent said the same of Sen. <a href="https://thehill.com/people/elizabeth-warren">Elizabeth Warren</a> (D-Mass.) and just 3 percent said the same of South Bend, Ind., Mayor <a href="https://thehill.com/people/peter-pete-buttigieg">Pete Buttigieg</a> (D) </p>
      <p>The poll also found that half of Democrats and leaners prefer a moderate nominee, while 33 percent prefer a liberal one and 17 percent want a conservative nominee. </p>
      <p>Researchers surveyed 437 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents between Nov. 1 and Nov. 11. Their responses have a margin of error of plus or minus 6 percentage points. </p>
