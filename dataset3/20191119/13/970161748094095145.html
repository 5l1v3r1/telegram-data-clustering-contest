        <b>Emmerdale star James Moore has called for a wider knowledge and awareness of the way disability can impact motor skills after he was mistakenly pulled over by police, suspected of drink driving. The disabled star, best known for playing Ryan Stocks in the show, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/01/23/james-moore-emmerdale-character-age-said-disability-8379321/">suffers from ataxic cerebral palsy, which impacts his movement and speech.</a></b>
      </p>
      <p>He took to Twitter to share a story with his followers which saw him reported by a member of the public who saw him making his way to his car with his girlfriend. He was later pulled over by police and had to undergo a breathalyser test to confirm that he wasn’t driving under the influence of alcohol.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘So @AtaxiaUK are running a campaign called disordered not drunk, where disabled people recount their stories of mistakenly being labelled drunk. Tonight I seem to have a new one.</p>
      <p>‘I went for a meal with my girlfriend, and as I was walking back to my car, someone apparently unbeknownst to me, called the police. I was pulled over half an hour later and was told a concerned citizen rang claiming that I was DUI.</p>

      <p>‘I took a breathalyser, proving I was sober – but it really makes you think- there needs to be more awareness for this because disability can affect balance and motor skills. It’s hard to tell sometimes. But maybe the easiest thing to do is ask.</p>

      <p>‘The police were fantastic- really understanding, and they let me go on my way very quickly, but it could have easily been avoided with a simple question.’</p>
      <p>The actor, who won the Best Newcomer Prize at the National Television Awards, was flooded with supportive messages and, in response, he admitted that he is just waiting for the situation to happen again.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘However, now I can’t help wonder when it will happen again. Because it’s happened before, and it’s just slightly disheartening to be under more scrutiny than an able bodied person because of my walking.’</p>
