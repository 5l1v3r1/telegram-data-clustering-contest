      <p>Late October, both Conor McGregor and the UFC came out saying that they’re <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/10/31/20940990/dana-white-ufc-looking-at-conor-mcgregor-vs-donald-cerrone-for-january-ufc-246-mma-news">“looking at” possibly having his return bout in January against Donald Cerrone</a>.</p>
      <p>When reports of <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/10/19/20922382/report-conor-mcgregor-investigation-second-sexual-assault-allegation-ufc-news">another sexual assault investigation</a> came out about the Irishman though, Dana White seemed to have pumped the brakes on the bout. He said it obviously <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/4/20948101/dana-white-ufc-president-comments-conor-mcgregor-sexual-assault-allegations-mma-news">wasn’t “stuff that we’re excited to hear” and that “there’s literally nothing going on”</a> in negotiations for McGregor’s return bout.</p>
      <p>A few weeks later, and McGregor’s team is still angling for a return bout against “Cowboy,” but called the negotiations a “work in progress.”</p>
      <p>“I would say that talks have been progressing,” McGregor’s manager Audie Attar told the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/sport/martial-arts/mixed-martial-arts/article/3038335/ufc-conor-mcgregors-manager-says-talks">South China Morning Post</a> about a return bout against Cerrone. “We’ve met them, we’re in close communication with them. I would hope that an announcement could happen in the coming weeks, but at the end of the day, it’s still a work in progress.”</p>
      <p>Attar states that while McGregor has made his money, he still plans to start being more active and wants compete often in the coming year.</p>
      <p>“He never has to fight one fight more in his life,” Attar added. “At the end of the day, that’s the thing people forgot about him; he actually is a competitor. He dares to do things differently.</p>
      <p>“I don’t see him slowing down,” he said. “I think that fighting once a year for the last couple of years, it’s almost like it’s grown his appetite to stay active. In any sport, the more reps you take, the better you get. He’s no stranger to becoming a world champion multiple times over. He knows what it takes.”</p>
      <p>Cerrone is coming off two losses to Tony Ferguson and Justin Gaethje, who also recently <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/10/25/20931582/ufc-justin-gaethje-conor-mcgregor-fight-january-show-the-world-the-little-coward-you-are-mma-news">called McGregor a “coward” for calling out the person he just knocked out.</a></p>
      <p>McGregor became a two-division UFC champion <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/13/20963296/bellator-double-champion-patricio-freire-trashes-conor-mcgregor-world-champ-champ-day-mma-news">over three years ago</a>. He hasn’t won a bout since.</p>
