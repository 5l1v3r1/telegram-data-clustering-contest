      <p>Torbay Council is planning to use the profits from running the Fleet Walk shopping centre in Torquay to fund improvements.</p>
      <p>The money will go into restoring and improving the centre and car park and then into regeneration of the wider shopping area.</p>
      <p>The deal to buy the centre for a sum believed to be approaching £20m has now been finalised.</p>
      <p>The 32 shops at Fleet Walk include some of the top high street names including TK Maxx, Sports Direct, JD Wetherspoon and Starbucks.</p>
      <p>It is understood the centre management has had interest from businesses in the three currently empty units.</p>
      <p>The purchase of the centre was made under the council’s £100m Economic Regeneration Fund created this year.</p>
      <p>The current management team is expected to stay in place.</p>
      <p>Fleet Walk forms a key part of Torquay’s shopping centre and the council aims to use its ownership to support the vitality of the area by improving the offer and attracting more visitors.</p>
      <p>The high street has suffered from the departure of big names, with New Look leaving in April and H&amp;M announcing its store in the former Woolworths building was for sale and expected to close.</p>
      <p>The switch to more leisure use received a boost in August when <a href="https://www.devonlive.com/news/devon-new-13-screen-cinema-3204685">Merlin Cinemas</a> was given planning permission to convert the empty former BHS store in Union Street into a new 13-screen cinema.</p>
      <p>Other regeneration schemes under way include the £32m redevelopment of Torwood Street near Torquay Harbour.</p>
      <p>The project will see the creation of a 130-bed Hilton Hotel, new offices, bars and restaurants.</p>
      <p>Torbay Council is funding the £11m build of a Premier Inn hotel on <a href="https://www.devonlive.com/news/devon-news/weeks-traffic-disruption-second-new-3449497">The Terrace car park</a> above the harbour.</p>
      <p>Work has started to prepare the site ahead of the main construction work on the six-floor 120-bed hotel.</p>
      <p>Along the seafront, the council is working with tenant the Venus Cafe on plans to convert the empty Old Toll House into a restaurant and bar.</p>
