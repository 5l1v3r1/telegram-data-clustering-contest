      <p>Nov. 19 (UPI) -- <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Martin_Scorsese/?tps=1">Martin Scorsese</a>'s <i>The Irishman</i> was turned into a Marvel film on<i> <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Jimmy_Kimmel/?tps=1">Jimmy Kimmel</a> Live</i> as part of a mash-up trailer.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-u0NmSAoLs">comedic clip</a> was inspired by Scorsese's previous comments that Marvel movies are not cinema.</p>
      <p>The filmmakers name was transformed into the Marvel logo for the trailer which featured <i>Irishman</i> star <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Robert_De_Niro/?tps=1">Robert De Niro</a> donning a magic ring and becoming an Irish-themed version of Iron Man.</p>
      <p>De Niro's co-star <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Al_Pacino/?tps=1">Al Pacino</a> is also featured as The Hulk.</p>
      <p>Scorsese was on hand to discuss with Kimmel the filming of <i>The Irishman</i> and how he utilized CGI effects to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N80s8hBLaJM">de-age his actors</a>. <i>The Irishman</i> takes place over decades, causing its characters to age throughout the film.</p>
      <p>"We were doing this youthification and it was an experiment. The whole thing was an experiment," he said.</p>
      <p>"There was a certain point after we finished the script, that we could have probably had them play younger, but I waited too long," he said. "By the time we got around together, they were too old to play young."</p>
      <p><i>The Irishman</i>, which also stars <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Joe_Pesci/?tps=1">Joe Pesci</a> and <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Ray_Romano/?tps=1">Ray Romano</a>, is coming to Netflix on Nov. 27.</p>
