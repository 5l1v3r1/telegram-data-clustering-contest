      <p>PlayStation 4 adventure Detroit: Become Human comes to PC on 12th December, developer Quantic Dream has announced.</p>
      <p>It'll be priced £29.99 on the Epic Games Store, where some of the studio's other games - Heavy Rain, Beyond: Two Souls - have already launched. A free demo will also be available at the same time.</p>
      <p>This PC version will offer 4K 60fps visuals and a new interface designed for mouse and keyboard, as well as gamepad controls.</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2018-05-24-detroit-become-human-review-clumsy-yet-effective-robot-rights-thriller">Eurogamer's Detroit review</a>, Oli Welsh dubbed it a "glib, rabble-rousing and admittedly enjoyable thriller" on PS4, despite the game's clumsy handling of its bigger themes.</p>
