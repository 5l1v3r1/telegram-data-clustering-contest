      <p>The new Pulse 4 differs from the Pulse 3 with its sound. The sound is improved further with a new PartyBoost mode which allows multiple speakers to be connected to each other creating a louder, fuller sound. The new louder and better sound can be controlled via the JBL Connect+ app.</p>
      <p>The Pulse 4 brings a full device speaker and light show and is visually stunning. For those who enjoy an outdoor party this is something that could light up the party making it a memorable night. The light show is provided by the 360 degree high-resolution LED lights underneath the surface of the device.</p>
