        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 18 – Education Cabinet Secretary Prof George Magoha has urged textbook suppliers to ensure affordability of course books in bookstores across the country.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Speaking during the opening of a modern Text Book Center bookstore in Nairobi, Magoha commended the book-seller for supporting the government’s quest for quality and universal access to education.</p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>“Ensure you make books affordable for majority of Kenyans to access,” he said.</p>
      <p>First Lady Margaret Kenyatta who graced the official opening of the bookstore at the Sarit Center Mall with amenities which include kid’s area urged the supplier to strive towards bridging the gap for access to quality learning material.</p>
      <p>She acknowledged efforts by the Ministry of Education to ensure a successful implementation of the new competency-based curriculum saying it will empower children as well as give them adequate skills for the future.</p>
      <p>“Ensure you make books affordable for majority of Kenyans to access,” she said.</p>
      <p>Text Book Center Managing Director Armand Houahu said the supplier intends to provide quality education to all children across the country</p>
      <p>‘‘As we expand within the country to better serve the devolved county structures, our key focus is to become the leading bookstore in the East African region and eventually a Pan-African powerhouse in the bookstore space,’’ Houahu said.</p>
      <p>He further stated the new modern store meets the demands of the changing education and technology landscape.</p>
      <p>With a new e-commerce platform, customers will now have access to all books and stationery from all over the world.</p>
      <p>The new store is set to revolutionize the educational, corporate and the general consumer sectors in Kenya by integrating offline and online book shopping, while giving customers an opportunity to preview books before purchase, and not after, as it has been with many bookstores.</p>
      <p>The store will provide a wide variety of office materials, professional books, novels, computers and accessories, art supplies, greeting cards, children’s books and stationery items among others.</p>
