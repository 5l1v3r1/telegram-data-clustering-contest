      <p>Dhaka - The Bangladesh Cricket Board on Tuesday banned former national team fast bowler <b>Shahadat Hossain </b>for three years after he assaulted a teammate in a match.</p>
      <p>The temperamental Shahadat was reported by umpires after he was seen to slap and kick a teammate during a National Cricket League match on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The national federation imposed a five-year ban but suspended two years of the punishment. Shahadat, who admitted a charge of "physical assault", was also fined 300,000 taka ($3,540), the board said.</p>
      <p>The 33-year-old bowler condemned the ban as "too harsh" and said it would effectively end his controversial cricket career.</p>
      <p>Shahadat attacked young bowler Arafat Sunny Jr during a game between Dhaka and Khulna after an argument over how to shine the ball, a board official said.</p>
      <p>"Considering his past behaviour we decided to punish him for five years. The last two years of his ban will remain suspended," said BCB technical committee chief Minhajul Abedin.</p>
      <p>Shahadat, who played 38 Tests and 51 one-day internationals for Bangladesh, spent nearly two months in detention in 2015 after he and his wife were accused of torturing an 11-year-old girl they employed as a maid.</p>
      <p>The couple originally went into hiding after police raided their house in September 2015 when the girl alleged they had beaten and tortured her.</p>
      <p>Police said that one of the girl's hands had been burnt with a hot cooking implement.</p>
      <p>Shahadat and his wife were cleared however when the case came to trial.</p>
      <p>The bowler told AFP the showdown with his teammate "happened in the heat of the moment" and denied that he slapped or kicked Arafat.</p>
      <p>"I only pushed him, I did not hurt him. But I agree it's a mistake. As a Test player I should not have done this. I will appeal," Shahadat said.</p>
      <p>"A five-year ban is too harsh for me. I would have accepted a six-month ban or some fine."</p>
      <p>"My mother is a cancer patient. She stopped eating after the news. If I am banned for five years it will take away my livelihood," he said.</p>
      <p>Shahadat also hit the headlines in 2018 when he allegedly beat a rickshaw driver for hitting his car in Dhaka.</p>
