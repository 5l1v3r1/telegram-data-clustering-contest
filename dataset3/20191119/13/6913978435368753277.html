      <p><b>PALERMO, Italy —</b> Ciro Immobile and Nicolo Zaniolo scored a brace each as Italy wrapped up their perfect Euro 2020 qualifying campaign with a crushing 9-1 win over Armenia in Palermo on Monday.<br/><br/>Already-qualified Italy registered an 11th straight win under coach Roberto Mancini, as the four-time world champions showed they were back on track after failing to qualify for last year's World Cup for the first time since 1958.<br/><br/>Mancini's side have won all 10 of their Group J matches and are assured of a seeding in the Euro 2020 draw on November 30 in Bucharest.<br/><br/>"Let's enjoy these 10 games won, it had never happened and it's an extraordinary thing," said 54-year-old Mancini.<br/><br/>"We had the right approach to the game and you don't score nine goals by chance.<br/><br/>"We have six months to prepare for the European Championship, we need to improve a few things, then the difficulty will be to leave some players at home, they all deserve to be there.<br/><br/>"They are all young lads who are improving game after game, it just takes time. Every player gave everything they had, I had the answers I wanted from them."<br/><br/>Immobile, 29, started the goal-spree on eight minutes in Sicily, adding a second in the 33rd minute.<br/><br/>Roma midfielder Zaniolo, 20, scored his first goal for the national side on nine minutes, completing a brace on 64 minutes.<br/><br/>Nicolo Barella, 22, also scored in the first half on front of a crowd of nearly 28,000 on the Mediterranean island.<br/><br/>Alessio Romagnoli, Jorginho's 75th-minute penalty, and goals from Riccardo Orsolini and Federico Chiesa concluded the hammering.<br/><br/>Edgar Babayan pulled a goal back for Armenia 10 minutes from time in a rout which could have been heavier with the Azzurri rattling the woodwork on multiple occasions.<br/><br/>"We have beaten several records but we know that June next year is the only thing that counts," said captain Leonardo Bonucci.<br/><br/>"Honestly, I have never had so much fun with the national team, we dominated every game."<br/><br/>"We are aware of our strengths, we have the right mentality and a very good, united group," said Immobile.<br/><br/>"There are all the ingredients to do well but we have to keep our feet firm on the ground and continue to work hard."<br/><br/>Zaniolo added: "I've made another dream come true tonight, but I realize it must be just the beginning..."<br/><br/>"A call-up for Euro 2020 is another dream and I hope to make that come true as well."<br/><br/>This was not quite either Italy's biggest international score or their largest margin of victory.<br/><br/>They beat Egypt 11-3 in the bronze-medal match at the 1928 Olympics in Amsterdam and the USA 9-0 at Brentford in the first round at the 1948 Olympics. In 1920, they beat France 9-4 in a friendly.<br/><br/>Italian football federation president Gabriele Gravina hailed Mancini from reviving enthusiasm in the Azzurri after the low of their World Cup qualifying disaster.<br/><br/>Italy will target their second European title after 1968 next year, with the opening game of the tournament in Rome.<br/><br/>"We rounded off an extraordinary journey this evening," said Gravina.<br/><br/>"It's a special vintage, a 2019 to frame. This is a team that has shown its true value, launching many young players.<br/><br/>"Mancini has put Italy back on the path of success." — AFP</p>
