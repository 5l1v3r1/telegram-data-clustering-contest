        <b>Daniel James might be the quickest player in world football, with only Kylian Mbappe able to challenge him for pace, reckons Hungary manager Marco Rossi.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hungary are preparing to take on Wales in an all-important Euro 2020 qualifier in Cardiff on Tuesday night, with the winners qualifying for the tournament next summer.</p>
      <p>A draw could be no good for either side, as if Slovakia can beat Azerbaijan then they will overtake both Hungary and Wales to grab second place.</p>
      <p>Rossi will be looking for all three points in Cardiff, but is well aware of the threat that James poses, having been very impressed with the flying <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a> winger.</p>
      <p>‘James is a player that is playing with a motorbike because he is really fast,’ said Rossi ahead of the Wales clash.</p>
      <p>‘I have never seen someone in the last period as fast as him, maybe Mbappe. He’s unbelievable.</p>

      <p>‘If we leave him space to run he could be dangerous. This could be the key, but we work a lot on the defensive line and will try to give confidence to our players.’</p>

      <p>James arrived at Old Trafford from Swansea for £15m and has made an impressive step up in his first season in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old has featured in all 12 of Manchester United’s Premier League games this campaign, scoring three goals and registering two assists.</p>
      <p>He has also been key for Wales, starting all seven qualification matches, and scoring the crucial only goal in their 1-0 win over Slovakia in March.</p>
      <p>Wales boss Ryan Giggs is a big fan of the winger, and even compared him to another former Manchester United superstar, Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>
      <p>‘Dan takes a lot of knocks but gets up, gets on with it and demands the ball back,’ said Giggs.</p>
      <p>‘Ronaldo, especially earlier on in his career, took a lot of knocks and would still demand the ball. It shows huge bravery.</p>
      <p>‘United fans like players who like to attack, who gets the fans off their feet — and he’s somebody who does that.</p>
      <p>‘With the form he’s in, he has been outstanding and a constant threat. He’s added goals and assists, which is a wingers’ game. He will get better and better — and I’m pleased for him.’</p>
