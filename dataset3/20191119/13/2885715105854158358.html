      <h1>Emraan Hashmi: If I’m readily available on web, why will people watch me in theatres</h1>
      <h2>Emraan Hashmi, who was last seen in Bard of Blood, says he wants to strike a balance between films and web.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:35:55+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/pti/" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>Actor <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/emraan-hashmi/">Emraan Hashmi</a> says he wants to strike a balance between films and web, and says he hasn’t given much thought about working more on streaming platforms.</p>
      <p>This year, the actor made his digital debut with Netflix’s Bard of Blood.</p>
      <p>Emraan played Indian intelligence agent Kabir Anand in the series, based on Bilal Siddiqi’s novel of the same name.</p>
      <p>“But as far as doing a lot of OTT, that’s something I haven’t given much thought. I am selective about it as you have to balance it out. If you’re so readily available on OTT platforms then why would someone come and see you in a cinema hall?” Emraan told PTI in an interview.</p>
      <p>The 40-year-old actor said the second season of the espionage drama is currently in the scripting stage and it is the only show he is committed to on the digital medium.</p>
      <p>“For me, ‘Bard’ was about exploring this worldwide audience with Netflix. I got a lot of offers for OTT platforms during that time. I get them even today. But I’ll only be committed to the second season, whenever it happens. It is still being written, I don’t know when it’s going to start.”</p>
      <p>The show, backed by Shah Rukh Khan’s Red Chillies Entertainment, also featured Sobhita Dhulipala, Viineet Kumar, Kirti Kulhari, Jaideep Ahlawat, among others.</p>
      <p>Bard of Blood was met with mixed reception upon its debut but Emraan said he is happy with the audience response.</p>
      <p>“Where probably that bit of criticism came in… By design the show was made to cater to a certain audience and penetrate into the mass centres too. We were juggling with two things… But what we were setting out to do, we accomplished that.”</p>
      <p>Despite a “few critics” who weren’t impressed with the series, the actor said he was flooded with texts and calls after people watched the series.</p>
      <p>“I get a lot of positive response when I go out and people say the show was amazing, that they binge-watched it. People I haven’t heard from in 10 years suddenly start messaging me saying they’re hooked.</p>
      <p>“I take that as a sign of a hit show. There are a few critics who would shoot holes, but the audience doesn’t see it that way. A lot of people have liked it. They don’t sit down to find things in it. They enjoy the journey,” he added.</p>
      <p>Emraan will next be seen in Jeethu Joseph’s The Body, featuring his Bard of Blood co-star Sobhita, veteran actor <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/rishi-kapoor/">Rishi Kapoor</a>, among others.</p>
      <p>The Hindi remake of the Spanish film of the same name, The Body is scheduled to be released on December 13.</p>
