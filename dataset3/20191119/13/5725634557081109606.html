      <h1>Top Merger Stocks Held By Fund Managers, Mid-Q4 2019</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:30:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:30</time> by <a rel="author">Special Situations and Arbs</a></address>
      <p>Summary</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Form 13F filings show fund managers' top arbitrage stocks.</li>
        <li>Top M&amp;A stocks of the 41 funds I follow.</li>
        <li>Celgene remains the number one arbitrage stock.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Four times a year, I spend several hours combing through Form 13F filings from the hedge funds that specialize in M&amp;A. I document and analyze which merger stocks the funds have bought and which ones they haven't. I then compile the top 10 stocks held in these funds and share it with everyone on Seeking Alpha.</p>

      <p>My rules:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I only count a stock if it is at least 1% of the fund's portfolio.</li>
        <li>I only include stocks that are still actively trading.</li>
        <li>I only choose funds where the vast majority of the positions are merger-related.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The top two arbitrage stocks are the same as last quarter. Celgene (NASDAQ:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CELG">CELG</a>) is tops, sitting in 34 of the 41 funds. Their deal with Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BMY">BMY</a>) is in the process of wrapping up with closing expected on Wednesday. It has been my largest position for some time now.</p>
      <p>Allergan (NYSE:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AGN">AGN</a>) is once again in the second spot but now 31 arb funds hold it in their portfolios, up from 24 last quarter. AbbVie (NYSE:<a href="https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ABBV">ABBV</a>) is buying Allergan in a cash and stock deal expected to close in the first quarter of 2020.</p>

      <p>Some arb funds oversize the positions that they have great conviction in. As of the end of Q3, there were six positions of 20% or more in a single stock.</p>

        <b>Conclusion</b>
      </p>
      <p>While there is no substitute for doing one's own work and developing one's unique trading/investing style, looking at what some of the top arb hedge funds are doing with their money is quite valuable. These funds have more resources, staff and contacts that an individual investor can possibly have.</p>
      <p>While there is no guarantee that the above deals will close the fact is more than 90 percent of all mergers do close and when the specialists allocate their money to an arb position the odds even get better.</p>
