      <p>Actor Jeff Goldblum has hinted Robert Downey Jr might be reprising his Iron Man role in Marvel Studios’ upcoming animated series What If…?.</p>
      <p>Downey Jr ended his stint as the beloved superhero with summer blockbuster Avengers: Endgame after playing the part in several Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films such as Iron Man, The Avengers, Captain America: Civil War and Spider-Man: Homecoming.</p>
      <p>Goldblum, who played The Grandmaster in Thor: Ragnarok, said an episode of the series will feature his character, Taika Waititi’s Korg and Iron Man, which Downey Jr will be voicing.</p>
      <p>“I played the part again a couple of days ago. I went to the Disney Studios and I recorded The Grandmaster’s voice for an episode of a show that’s gonna be on Disney+ that’s called ‘What If…?’,” the veteran actor told BuzzFeed in a video.</p>
      <p>“It’s an animated version of all the characters we know and love from Marvel and this episode included the Grandmaster and Iron Man, so Robert Downey Jr will do a voice for that, and Korg… Taika Waititi had already recorded his voice for that, so yeah, for a couple hours I enjoyed doing that,” he added.</p>
      <p>What If…? is based on a past Marvel Comics series that featured out-of-continuity stories with unusual team-ups or alternate versions of previous tales.</p>
      <p>Westworld star Jeffrey Wright is voicing The Watcher, an extraterrestrial being who narrates the series.</p>
      <p>It will premiere on Disney+ in 2021.</p>
