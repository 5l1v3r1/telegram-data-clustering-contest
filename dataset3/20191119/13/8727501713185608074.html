        <i>Put your money away! Here are the week’s best free events</i>
      </p>
      <h3>Leo Villareal</h3>
      <p>American artist Leo Villareal has already brightened up the city with his installations on four London bridges as part of ‘Illuminated River’. Now, he’s bringing his light installations to Pace Gallery in Mayfair. The LEDs in his artworks flicker and move in a way that’s mesmerising – and way more aesthetically pleasing than any festive light display. <i>Pace Gallery. Tube: Green Park. Fri Nov 22-Jan 18 2020.</i></p>
      <h3>Taiwanese fried chicken</h3>
      <p>New eatery Mr Ji aims to bring the buzz of Taiwan’s Shilin Night Market to Soho. Specialising in fried chicken, it opens this week and is giving away 100 Big Jis (its signature fried chicken breast): 50 from noon and 50 from 6pm. <i>Mr Ji. Tube: Leicester Square. Fri Nov 22.</i></p>
      <h3>Haymarket Wine House</h3>
      <p>Fancy a glass of wine? It’s on the house at newly opened Haymarket Wine House, which is handing out 60 free glasses from 6pm to 7pm today. It’s even throwing in snacks of cheese and popcorn. We’ll drink to that! <i>Haymarket Wine House. Tube: Piccadilly Circus. Tue Nov 19</i>.</p>
      <h3>Nail salon launch</h3>
      <p>Spruce up your talons at the opening of Shoreditch Nails’ Dalston branch. The new salon is offering free file-and-polish manicures plus snacks and wine while you get pampered. It’s first come, first served, so get down there early. <i>Shoreditch Nails Dalston. Dalston Junction Overground. Tue Nov 19, 11am-6pm.</i></p>
      <h3>Espresso and brioche</h3>
      <p>It’s National Espresso Day on Saturday (that’s in your diary, right?) and Chez Antoinette is celebrating early with free espressos between 7.30am and 10am this Friday. The first 50 people will get a gratis mini praline brioche too. Sweet! <i>Chez Antoinette Victoria. Tube: St James’s Park. Fri Nov 22.</i></p>
