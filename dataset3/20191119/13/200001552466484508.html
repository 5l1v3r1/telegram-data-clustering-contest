      <h1>“They come second” – Journalist makes clear Liverpool can beat club in transfer chase</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:33:38+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://sportwitness.co.uk/author/annie/" target="_blank">Sport Witness Team</a></address>
      <p>Ciro Venerato, a journalist for Italian agency RAI, spoke to CalcioNapoliTV on Monday and delivered some uncomfortable truths about the club’s potential transfer business.</p>
      <p>Napoli are currently seventh in Serie A and there’s a real crisis situation around the club, with Carlo Ancelotti’s position already coming under threat.</p>
      <p>Some fans are looking towards the January window as a time to solve problems, yet Venerato, who covers the Naples club, has insisted the issues won’t be solved with signings.</p>
      <p>Having dampened those hopes, he then proceeded to throw a bucket of cold water over ideas of signing Sander Berge… because of Liverpool.</p>
      <p>Berge, a 21 year old midfielder, has been impressing for Genk this season and recently received praise from Jurgen Klopp. There’s been repeat links with Liverpool and Venerato explained there’s no way Napoli would be able to compete against the Reds.</p>
      <p><a href="http://sscalcionapoli1926.altervista.org/?p=260016">CalcioNapoli</a> quote him as saying: “<i>Berge? If Napoli goes for a player stalked by Liverpool, they come second. It is well known that there are major clubs in the world. They like Berge, but I don’t know if he will come.”</i></p>
      <p>The youngster is unlikely to move during the January window, with his continued development being the most important thing right now.</p>
