      <p>Germany coach Joachim Low has insisted his side are not favourites to win the upcoming 2020 UEFA Championship, and named six teams he thinks have a better chance, but snubbed defending champions Portugal.</p>

      <p>The 59-year-old guided Die Mannschaft to victory at the 2014 FIFA World Cup, and also reached the semi-finals of the past three European Championships.</p>
      <p>However, their shocking group-stage exit from the 2018 World Cup still hangs like a cloud over Low's side, which has since been revamped by the coach.</p>
      <p>Germany have already qualified for Euro 2020 with a game to spare, but Low has now insisted they are not among the favourites for the tournament, with 2016 winners Portugal also not among his picks.</p>
      <p>"Teams like England, France, Spain, Italy, Belgium and Holland are ahead of us," he said, as quoted by <i>Marca</i>.</p>
      <p>"They've had a generational revamp. But I don't see us as favourites for the Euros."</p>

      <p>Low, though, did express his satisfaction with Germany's performances in the qualifiers, which saw them win six and lose just one game ahead of their final qualification match against Northern Ireland on Tuesday night.</p>
      <p>"I want to congratulate my players," he added.</p>
      <p>"We have a revamp and then a series of revamps inside a revamp because more than 10 players got injured.</p>
      <p>"Despite all this, we qualified comfortably."</p>

      <p>Germany have won the European Championship three times so far, their last triumph dating back to 1996.</p>
