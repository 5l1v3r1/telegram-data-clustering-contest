      <p>Funded by Comic Relief and inspired by the BBC programme Our Dementia Quoir, the care homes taking part include Seckford Almshouses, Jubilee House and Grove Court.</p>
      <p>Alongside pupils from Barnabus pre-school, Woodbridge Prep School, St Mary's Primary and Saxmundham Free School, the choir will belt out festive favourites for the community.</p>
      <p>The event is free to attend.</p>

      <p>Residents, relatives, friends and staff will also be joining in the fun to create a joyful Christmas atmosphere for people in care homes who share the same interests or may be experiencing similar situations.</p>
      <p>Trish Middleton, manager at Glebe House, said: "The uplifting effect the choir generates is remarkable.</p>
      <p>"It's brought residents who are usually quiet out of themselves, everyone enjoys singing along and even after the session residents are laughing and smiling all afternoon."</p>
      <p>The concert will take place on Wednesday December 4 at 11.30am and any donations received will go to St Elizabeth Hospice.</p>
