      <p><a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Ulster">Ulster</a> outhalf <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Billy+Burns">Billy Burns</a> has signed a new deal with the province, keeping him in Belfast until the summer of 2022.</p>
      <p>Burns joined Ulster from Gloucester in the summer of 2018, and has become the first choice number 10 at Ravenhill.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old has made 28 appearances for the province, forming a potent halfback partnership with <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=John+Cooney">John Cooney</a>, and has extended his contract by two years.</p>
      <p>On the confirmation of his new deal, Ulster boss Dan McFarland said: “It is great news that Billy has committed to Ulster. He is still a young man who is desperate to keep learning and developing both as a player and athlete.</p>
      <p>“He has already contributed hugely on the pitch throughout last year’s campaign, and has demonstrated an excellent ability to lead a team. We’re all looking forward to Billy being a driving force in our group into the future.”</p>
      <p>Meawhile, Burns said: “Since joining Ulster last summer, I’ve made it my home and have really enjoyed my time here. The support I’ve had has been incredible and we have a great group of players, so it was a no-brainer for me to extend my contract.</p>
      <p>“Kingspan Stadium is a great place to play rugby and I’m really pleased that I’ve got at least another couple of years of that to look forward to.”</p>
