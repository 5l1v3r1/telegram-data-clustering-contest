      <h1>New high school plan pushes ahead for rundown secondary despite funding knock back</h1>
      <h2>The campus could cost up to £20 million</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:28:03+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:28</time> by <a rel="author">Sarah Hilley, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/sarah-hilley/</a></address>
      <p>A potential £20 million replacement school for rundown Doon Academy is still on the table despite a funding knock back.</p>
      <p>East Ayrshire Council leader Douglas Reid has been in touch with Scottish Cabinet Secretary Derek Mackay to make the case for the new Dalmellington high school.</p>
      <p>The campus proposal would also see the construction of a new primary for the town.</p>
      <p>SNP Councillor Reid said he has written and spoken to the finance minister and received a positive response.</p>
      <p>He said: “The council have put quite a bit of money towards a new school. We are hoping the Scottish Government will assist with funding as well.”</p>
      <p>It is hoped another wave of potential Holyrood funding would include cash for the new secondary.</p>
      <p>Council officials now plan to submit a second bid since the first one was rejected.</p>
      <p>Councillor Reid continued: “Fingers crossed for Doon Academy. This would ensure a secondary provision in the Doon Valley.”</p>
      <p>There are hopes for a “definitive answer” in the new year, he added. <br/>He described the secondary plans as the  final piece of the jigsaw for the area considering Patna's new school and the construction of Bellsbank Primary getting underway.</p>
      <p>Highlighting the importance of the high school, he stressed it shouldn't miss out on facilities just because it is small.</p>
      <p>Doon Valley Councillor Drew Wilson said it would be one of the largest investments in the area.</p>
      <p>The independent politician said: "It will be a new modern facility that can only boost the attainment of our young people for the future." <br/>A council paper presented to cabinet councillors recently said the Doon Academy “building continues to deteriorate.”</p>
      <p>It said the “initial bid for Scottish Government funding (for the school) has been unsuccessful.”</p>
      <p>It is understood refurbishment is not a feasible option because of asbestos.</p>
      <p>The secondary’s main building has been rated as amber by the council - which means it needs work. <br/>The race is now on to get the cash secured and the new school plan back on track. <br/>The council’s property management plan report said: “progress to finalise a</p>
      <p>scheme  will be  required within  2020 with a further  bid for funding to be submitted at the next stage of the New Learning Estate Investment Programme.”</p>
      <p>The new school could cost between £15 million to £20 million.</p>
