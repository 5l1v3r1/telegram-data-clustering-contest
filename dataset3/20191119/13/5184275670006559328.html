      <p>Awaiting the official announcement of the project soon!</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Kangana Ranaut, who will next be seen playing former Tamil Nadu chief minister, the late J. Jayalalithaa, in the forthcoming multilingual biopic “<a href="https://www.koimoi.com/bollywood-news/thalaivi-arvind-swamis-new-look-as-mgr-from-kangana-ranauts-jayalalithaa-biopic-goes-viral/"><i>Thalaivi</i></a>“, admits finding it difficult to learn the Tamil language. She added that she is learning the language as per the demand of the film’s script.</p>
      <p>“I am finding it difficult to learn Tamil. This film will be released in Hindi and Tamil, so we will do something about it. Obviously, I have to mug up those dialogues because Tamil is not an easy language. Earlier, I was trying to learn the complete Tamil language because I have learned English as well, but now I am learning Tamil as per the demand of film’s script,” said Kangana, while interacting with the media at the launch Beauty Studio salon in Mumbai.</p>
