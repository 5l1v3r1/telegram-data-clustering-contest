      <h1>Former England player Joe Worsley is back coaching in France</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:52:06+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:52</time> by <a rel="author">Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>England World Cup winner Joe Worsley has <a href="https://castres-olympique.com/actualite/joe-worsley-arrive-au-co-en-qualite-dentraineur-de-la-defense/">landed himself a new coaching role</a> – coaching defence at Top 14 outfit Castres.</p>
      <p>The 42-year-old, who was part of Clive Woodward’s all-conquering squad of 2003 in Australia, had recently been a technical adviser with <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/georgia">Georgia</a> at the World Cup in France.</p>
      <p>After spending his entire playing career at Wasps, Worsley’s coaching career took off in <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/six-nations/teams/france">France</a> where he spent seven years involved at Bordeaux, initially as defence coach before <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/news/elite-coaching-is-increasingly-no-country-for-old-men-but-68-year-old-alan-solomons-is-bucking-that-trend/">climbing the ranks into the head coaching role</a>.</p>
      <p>He stepped away from them earlier this year but now, following a hiatus with the Georgians in Japan, he has arrived back in France for a job at Castres, who were beaten last weekend in the Challenge Cup at Dragons.</p>
      <p>Worcester are next up for <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/castres">Castres</a> in Europe, but it is on the domestic front where the club will be hoping for Worsley to have an immediate impact having joined on a deal that will take him through to the end of this season.</p>

      <p>After nine rounds in this year’s Top 14, Castres, now coached by former <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/internationals/teams/argentina">Argentina</a> prop Mauricio Reggiardo, are struggling in ninth place with just four wins and a points differential of -17.</p>
      <p>They resume their league schedule at <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/top-14/teams/la-rochelle">La Rochelle</a> on November 30 having lost all five away games this season, four in Top 14 and one in Europe.</p>
