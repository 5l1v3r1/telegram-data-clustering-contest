      <h3>Bitcoin Price Analysis (Daily Chart)</h3>
      <p>At the end of the October 2019, bitcoin started a sharp increase from the $7,283 low against the US Dollar. BTC surged above the $8,000 and $9,100 resistance levels. Moreover, there was a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/10/27/bitcoin-btc-price-weekly-forecast-is-this-real-bullish-break/">nasty spike above the $10,000 resistance area</a>.</p>
      <p>However, the price failed to settle above the $10,000 resistance and the 100-day simple moving average. A high was formed near $10,576 before the price started a fresh decline.</p>
      <p>This month, the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/10/bitcoin-btc-price-weekly-forecast-more-downsides-likely/">price lost almost all its gains</a> and traded below the key $9,100 pivot level. Besides, the price broke the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the October’s rally from the $7,283 low to $10,576 high.</p>
      <p>It is now trading well below the $8,500 support and the 100-day simple moving average. An immediate support is near the $8,060 level since it coincides with the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the October’s rally from the $7,283 low to $10,576 high.</p>
      <p>If there is a downside break below the $8,060 and $8,000 support levels, bitcoin is likely to slide towards the $7,400 support area or the $7,283 low. In such cases, the price mostly breaks the last swing low ($7,283).</p>
      <p>In the mentioned case, the <b>price may perhaps test the $6,500 support</b>. It represents the 1.236 Fib extension level of the October’s rally from the $7,283 low to $10,576 high.</p>
      <p>On the upside, there are many resistances for the bulls, starting with $8,500. Additionally, there is a crucial bearish trend line forming with resistance near $8,880 on the daily chart of the BTC/USD pair.</p>
