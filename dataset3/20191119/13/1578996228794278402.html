      <h1>Kate Middleton Revealed Princess Charlotte Is Already a Musical Theatre Kid</h1>

      <p>Musical theatre kids, rejoice: There's a four-year-old princess among you. Kate Middleton revealed last night at the Royal Variety Performance that her daughter Princess Charlotte is super into shows. George is too, but not like Charlotte.</p>
      <p><i>Mary Poppins </i>West End actress, Nuala Peberby, 14, told <i><a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/royalty/2019111980769/kate-middleton-princess-charlotte-loves-performing/">Hello!</a> </i>that "[Kate] said that her children love performing at home, particularly Charlotte. She told us how lucky we were to be on stage in the West End and asked how we managed to do it with all our schoolwork. I can’t tell you how exciting it was to meet them."</p>
      <p>Charlotte's love of theatre isn't too surprising given her personality. A <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a29640237/prince-george-princess-charlotte-louis-home-life-details/">source told <i>Us Weekly </i>last month</a> that “Charlotte’s extremely confident and loves attention, whereas George is more reserved, although he is starting to come out of his shell." Confident and loves attention? Yeah, she'll be the star of a school play in no time.</p>
      <p>Kate also revealed her children are into gymnastics. She told six-year-old Aurelia from acrobatic group Zurcarohc that George and Charlotte love doing acrobatics at home, particularly handstands and cartwheels.</p>
      <p>George and Charlotte weren't impressed with their parents' decision not to take them to their event last night.</p>
      <p>Kate said during the Royal Variety Performance that at first George and Charlotte had been excited about their parents going to watch an evening of dancing and singing for charity. Then they asked if they could come, and Kate told them "not on a school night!" and some of their excitement died down. Maybe next year.</p>
