      <p>We have always heard that drinking hot water has a number of health benefits. Of course, it does! The fact is true to quite an extent. Most people who drink hot water as a holistic health benefit do so first thing in the morning or right before they go to sleep, for optimal health benefit. It is essential to know that the temperature of hot water should not be too high to scald your taste buds. However, there are also some side effects of drinking too much warm water. Let's take a look at the benefits and side effects:</p>
      <h3>Benefits</h3>
      <p>According to the National Institutes of Health, drinking hot water is known to relieve nasal congestion and aids digestion. Inhaling warm, moisture-rich air (vapour) while holding a cup of hot water in front of your face can help loosen clogged sinuses and even relieves headache. We know that water is a lubricant that keeps your digestive tract smooth and glossy.<br/><br/>As the hot water passes through your stomach and intestines, digestive organs are better hydrated and are able to eliminate waste. Studies have proven that drinking hot water calms down the central nervous system. When your nervous system is primed for healthy and controlled reactions, you will find that you will feel fewer aches and pains in the body. It also helps relieve constipation. Many people also believe that drinking hot water helps lose weight. However, medical practitioners say that it depends on one’s body’s metabolism.<br/>As hot water temporarily begins to raise your internal body temperature, it helps in getting rid of toxins in the body. This is because when you drink hot water or take a hot bath, your body’s endocrine system activates and you start to sweat releasing toxins from the body.</p>

      <h3>Side effects</h3>
      <p>It is said that drinking too much hot water, even when not thirsty, can cause an imbalance in the water concentration in the body. Also, too much water at a time can cause swelling of brain cells. There are also chances of burns and scalds due to hot water.<br/>Consumption of water which is too hot can scald lips, tongue or the inner lining of the mouth. It can cause blisters or ulcers in the mouth, making it difficult for one to chew or drink for a few days. Hence, always check temperature before gulping. It is better to keep it warm rather than hot.  </p>
