      <p>Essex County Council's task and finish group is hoping to work with religious groups to aid their efforts in the New Year.</p>
      <p>The group's chairman councillor Carlo Guglielmi has met several times to discuss the idea with authorities across the county and will report back on Monday, January 13.</p>
      <p>County lines gangs force vulnerable individuals - including children as young as 11 - into trafficking drugs from large cities to rural areas.</p>
      <p>Mr Guglielmi recently spoke to the Bishop of Colchester, Rt Rev Roger Morris, about the possibility of the church's involvement.</p>
      <p>He said: "We would look to work together with the Rt Rev Morris in the future and he is a fantastic bishop to engage with us.</p>
      <p>"Essex is a county which is looking to use the resources we have and not to duplicate if we can."</p>
      <p>He confirmed that Â£70,000 of funding has been allocated to the Police, Fire and Crime Commissioner and he is keen for it to be well spent.</p>
      <p>The idea is for religious groups to assist in early prevention and education alongside councils, health and voluntary bodies.</p>
      <p>The Bishop Roger recently spoke to the councillor about the possibility of working with him at a university conference on young people and knife crime.</p>
      <p>"I welcome councillor Guglielmi's suggestion of approaching Faith Groups and Community Groups to help tackle county lines," he said.</p>
      <p>"He will know that I am personally and professionally committed to seeing our young people flourish and to help them live lives that are free from exploitation and violence."</p>
      <p>He noted a recent report from charities examining cuts to children's services which halved their funding.</p>
      <p>He added: "These dramatic cuts were inextricably linked to a rise in youth knife crime and the criminal exploitation of children by county lines gangs.</p>
      <p>"If we as a county are truly serious about tackling issues such as county lines, then we will commit to supporting a properly funded youth service as well as strengthening those organisations like the Children's Society who already do so much in this area."</p>
