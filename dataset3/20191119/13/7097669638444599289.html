      <h1>Policeman faces manslaughter charge over death of Ethiopian Israeli</h1>

      <p>Jerusalem (AFP) - An Israeli policeman is to be indicted for "manslaughter" over the killing of a young man of Ethiopian origin in June, an incident that sparked widespread protests, police said Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Solomon Teka, 19, was killed by an unnamed off-duty policeman in Kiryat Haim, near the northern port city of Haifa on June 30.</p>
      <p>Teka's death sparked three days of nationwide protests that were often violent over longstanding grievances of Ethiopian-Israelis, who say they are discriminated against and targeted by police.</p>
      <p>The policeman, who was placed under house arrest in the weeks following the killing, is accused of manslaughter, according to the findings of a police investigation.</p>
      <p>"He used his weapon in a way that put the victim's life in danger," the findings said.</p>
      <p>"He did not just fire a warning shot in the air to neutralise the danger he faced."</p>
      <p>Initially, the police reported that the policeman had come across a fight between young men and had tried to intervene.</p>
      <p>After the officer identified himself, the youths threw stones at him and he opened fire after feeling his life was in danger, the police statement said.</p>
      <p>But the other young men and a passer-by said the policeman was not attacked, Israeli media reported.</p>
      <p>"The policeman involved in the incident has been relieved of his duties in the police force," police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said Tuesday, indicating the killing was not motivated by racism.</p>
      <p>There are some 140,000 Ethiopian-Israelis, of whom around 50,000 were born in the Jewish state. They are Jewish, but say they are in many cases still seen as outsiders.</p>
      <p>Most are descendants of communities cut off from the Jewish world for centuries, who were belatedly recognised as Jews by Israeli religious authorities.</p>
      <p>Israel took in tens of thousands of them in the 1980s and 1990s.</p>
      <p>The community has consistently complained of institutionalised racism.</p>
      <p>Thousands of Ethiopian-Israelis took to the streets of Tel Aviv in January after a young community member was shot dead by a police officer when he allegedly rushed at him holding a knife.</p>
