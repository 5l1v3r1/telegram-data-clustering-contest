      <p>With Christmas just 36 days away now, your diary is likely getting filled up with late night festivities.</p>
      <p>These late nights can play havoc with the amount of sleep you get, and now a new test could shed light on the effect this sleep deprivation could have on your reaction times.</p>
      <p>Hillarys has developed the <a href="https://www.hillarys.co.uk/static/christmas-alertness-test/game.html">reaction time test</a>, which reveals whether you’re as alert as an athlete, a well-rested person, a drunk person or an elderly person.</p>
      <p>Lucy Askew, a spokesperson for Hillarys, said: “Losing a little sleep here and there might not seem a big deal, but it dramatically affects our reactions, with studies showing that a lack of rest can have more of an impact on our reaction times than alcohol.</p>

      <p>“Anyone in their mid-twenties scoring an unusually large number of scores describing their reaction times as that of an ‘OAP’ might want to consider going to bed a little earlier tonight and repeating the quiz again tomorrow!”</p>
      <p>The test challenges you to watch an on-screen cannon animation, and click your mouse or press any button on your smartphone or keyboard as soon as Santa is fired out of a cannon.</p>
      <p>Based on how quickly you react, you’ll then be given a rating as an athlete (up to 0.155ms), a well-rested person (0.156 to 250ms), a tipsy person (250 to 280ms) or an elderly person (280ms upwards).</p>
      <p>So far, over 3,028 people have tested their reaction times on the site.</p>
      <p>The results have revealed that only 8.79% are as alert as an athlete, while 24.01% are as alert as a well-rested person.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, 14.33% are as alert as a drunk person, and the majority (29.47%) have the reaction times of an OAP!</p>
