        <b>A Swedish prosecutor has confirmed the alleged rape investigation involving WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is currently in prison in Britain, has been dropped.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Deputy Chief Prosecutor Eva-Marie Persson offered the update on the Swedish case on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>In June, a Swedish court ruled that Assange shouldn't be detained. This meant that a preliminary investigation in Sweden continued, but he could be questioned in Britain.</p>
      <p>Assange had been evicted from the Ecuadorian embassy in London two months beforehand.</p>
      <p>The 48-year-old is currently serving a 50-week sentence in Britain for jumping bail in 2012.</p>
      <p>He's also fighting extradition to the US, where he's accused of publishing secret documents.</p>
