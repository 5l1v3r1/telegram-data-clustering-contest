      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:51:47+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:51</time> by <a rel="author">James Rodger, https://www.facebook.com/jamesrodgerjournalist</a></address>
      <p>Liam Gallagher has revealed what happened to a former bandmate who left Oasis during the 1990s.</p>
      <p>Paul McGuigan, better known by his nickname Guigsy, was one of the five founding members of the Britpop icons.</p>
      <p>He was the group's bassist from 1991 to 1999.</p>
      <p>On his current tour, Liam has been reunited with fellow founding member Paul 'Bonehead' Arthurs.</p>
      <p>The duo were reunited on-stage last week in Birmingham as Liam played the city's Arena.</p>
      <p>They tore through a host of Oasis classics together - from Rock'n'Roll Star and Supersonic to Roll With It, Champagne Supernova and Cigarettes and Alcohol.</p>

      <p>As his Why Me? Why Not tour continues, one social media follower was quick to ask Liam what became of 'Guigs'.</p>
      <p>"Hey @liamgallagher do you ever know where Guigsy was? It could be best if you bring him to your gigs," asked one Instagram follower.</p>
      <p>McGuigan presently lives in Mill Hill, North London with his wife and son.</p>
      <p>And Liam duly replied to the fan, writing: "Not seen him since he left the band and he only lives up the road."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Angry Noel, meanwhile, has revealed every tweet from his brother Liam is a "nail in the coffin" of Oasis reunion hopes.</p>
      <p>The guitarist and songwriter said his younger sibling would put his life on hold to reunite the band. But Noel said he would not get back on stage with his "moron" brother.</p>
      <p>Liam became embroiled in a feud with his sister-in-law Sara MacDonald, and was alleged to have sent threatening messages.</p>
      <p>Noel, defending his wife, said his brother's comments were destroying the chances of an Oasis reunion.</p>
