      <p>It was almost impossible to reduce the refueling time, since the rate of fuel entry into the tank was limited. It was possible to win time only with a perfect connection and disconnection of the filling hose.</p>
      <p>To manage a successful pit stop, you need to have good equipment, discipline and constant training. Given that you can manage all of the above, it is still impossible to eliminate the nervous tension of the mechanics when they are waiting for the car on the pit lane. They know that in the next few seconds it depends on their work whether the pilot will possibly win a position or lose everything that was gained on the track.</p>
      <p>To that idea, last Sunday in Sao Paulo at Interlagos, on their way to victory, Red Bull Racing Honda updated its own record beating the time previously managed in the United Kingdom at Silverstone, and with a very significant margin for that matter. The first pit stop of Max Verstappen took only 1.82 seconds, a new all-time world record.</p>
      <p>Thanks to the new record, Red Bull prematurely guaranteed itself a victory in the unofficial championship of pit stops this season. The team has 479 points versus 429 for Williams and 305 for Ferrari. The crowned world champions Mercedes are only fourth here, with the slowest of the bunch being Haas and Racing Point.</p>
      <p>In this modern turbo-hybrid era of mega fast pit stops, this could probably be as fast as it gets since the 2021 Formula 1 regulations will see that the cars a tad heavier and the diameter of the wheels increased. üèÅ</p>

        <p>18 NOVEMBER 2019</p>
        <p>Red Bull have made history again in Brazil. For the third time in the 2019 season, they improved on the Formula 1 pit-stop record.</p>
        <p>Red Bull have written Formula 1 history in the pits for the third time in 2019 by pulverizing their own record for the fastest tire change of all time. In an almost incredible 1.82 seconds, they managed to change all four tires on Max Verstappen‚Äôs car when it came in for the first of its three pit stops at Interlagos. For the eighth time, the team has also delivered the DHL Fastest Pit Stop.</p>
        <p>DHL Fastest Pit Stop Award: All you need to know</p>
        <p>When Formula 1 switched to larger and heavier tires in 2017, it seemed improbable that the record stop of 1.92 seconds performed by Williams in 2016 would ever be undercut. But after two years of intense practice, the Red Bull crew cracked the record for the first time in 2019 during the pit stop of Pierre Gasly at Silverstone with a time of 1.91 seconds.</p>
        <p>A week later at Hockenheim, they went one better, servicing Max Verstappen in 1.88 seconds despite the wet conditions ‚Äì the first ever stop under 1.90 seconds. Now, in Brazil, they have proved that it can be done even faster, shaving a further six hundredths off to post a time of 1.82 seconds.</p>
        <p>Brazil was perfect for Red Bull in every way. Not only did they set a new world record in the pits; Max Verstappen, starting from pole position, drove an outstanding race, in which he comfortably held world champion Lewis Hamilton at bay and won with a three-stop strategy.</p>
        <p>Verstappen: ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt easy out there but the team made all the right calls, especially at the end to pit for the soft tires during the safety car which gave us the win today.‚Äù In addition to the record stop, the team put in the third quickest (2.12 seconds) and fourth fastest (2.17 seconds) of the race. Despite working under the mounting pressure of the battle for position on the track, they didn‚Äôt put a foot wrong.</p>
        <p>‚ÄúAs a team you always try and make everything perfect,‚Äù says Verstappen. ‚ÄúI focus on my job, and the team also try to do a perfect job in the pits and on the strategy, and clearly today it worked out pretty perfectly.‚Äù</p>
        <p>By virtue of their impeccable pit stops, Red Bull have now made themselves unassailable in the battle for the 2019 DHL Fastest Pit Stop Award. In the overall standings, they have 52 points ahead of second-placed Williams, with only the Abu Dhabi weekend remaining. They have also posted the five fastest stops of the year - 1.82, 1.88, 1.91, 1.93 and 1.96 seconds.</p>
