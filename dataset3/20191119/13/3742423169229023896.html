      <h1>What To Ask For If An Airline Changes Your Flight</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.lifehacker.com.au/author/josh-ocampo" target="_blank">Josh Ocampo</a></address>
      <p>If an <a href="https://lifehacker.com/what-to-ask-for-when-youre-bumped-from-a-flight-1836448891">airline involuntarily bumps you</a> from a flight, chances are you can ask for a whole more than you think, like meal vouchers, a hotel stay or just cold, hard cash. But what are your rights if an airline suddenly decides to change your flight’s departure time entirely? It happens; over on Reddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/airlines/comments/9xm5y4/frontier_airlines_changed_a_flight_by_more_than/">u/kaileen</a> shared their family member’s experience when an airline changed their itinerary last-minute.</p>
      <p>“My brother bought a ticket from Frontier Airlines back in August,” they wrote. “The original flight was for this Saturday at 5:45am. He just got an email for a new itinerary that has him leaving Sunday at 6:00am ... If this isn’t a mistake, is there anything that can be done to get a discount or some kind of compensation for the inconvenience? I know Frontier isn’t famous for being great to fly with, but this just seems ridiculous.”</p>
      <p>It is ridiculous—but don’t expect any compensation. Generally, in the best-case scenario, you can ask to be rebooked on a different flight for free or to just be given a refund, which you can use that to rebook on another airline, at least.</p>
      <p>Below are several policies for several major Australian airlines that you should definitely take a closer look at, so you can better understand what to ask for when your departure time changes in a major way:</p>
      <h3>
        <a href="https://www.qantas.com/au/en/book-a-trip/flights/compensation-and-refunds-policy.html">Qantas</a>
      </h3>
      <h4>Commercial overbooking</h4>
      <blockquote>We take the utmost care in managing each flight, but on rare occasions a flight may be overbooked and we may need to seek a volunteer to change to another flight. If there are no volunteers, we will choose passengers to change to another flight. If this happens to you, and you arrived on time for your confirmed flight with all required documentation, we will re-book you on the next available Qantas flight and provide you with the assistance (in accordance with the above table for a delay or cancellation within our control). If you are flying internationally and the next available flight departs over 4 hours after your scheduled departure time, you will also be given a Qantas travel voucher.</blockquote>
      <h4>Refunds for delays, cancellations and overbooking</h4>
      <blockquote>   •  If we cancel your flight and we cannot offer you suitable alternative arrangements.<br/>   •  If we delay your flight to the extent that you have to cancel your travel.<br/>   •  If we make a significant change# to the scheduled flight time and we are unable to book you on an alternative flight that is acceptable to you. <br/>   •  If we cause you to miss a connecting Qantas flight on which you have a confirmed reservation. <br/>   •  If we are unable to carry you and you have a confirmed reservation.</blockquote>

If your new flight is more than 2 hours from your original scheduled time of departure but you choose to accept your new flight, we will also provide you with a credit (other than if you are delayed in the USA, see below) for your inconvenience as follows:<br/><br/>   •  $50 for domestic and international short haul flights; and<br/>   •  $250 for international long-haul flights where you are delayed in Australia or Hong Kong.<br/>If the new flight time is not suitable to you, you may request a Travel Bank credit or a refund of the total price you paid for your impacted flight by contacting our Guest Contact Centre or your travel agent.

      <p>If you want to change your flight or request a refund, understand the policies that affect you and contact your airline immediately to request a change. It’s worth noting, however, that if a scheduled change affects your ability to make a layover, chances are the airline will try to better accommodate you (though there are no rules in place that point out specific time limits).</p>
      <p>Also, if you booked two legs of a trip on <i>separate</i> airlines, and might risk missing the connection, know that your second airline doesn’t owe you much of anything in this scenario.
