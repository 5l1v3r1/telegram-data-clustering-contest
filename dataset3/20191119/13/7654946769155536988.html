      <h1>Thousands of hacked Disney+ accounts are being sold on dark web</h1>

      <p>Hackers are selling thousands of Disney+ accounts on the black market following the streaming service’s error-plagued launch.</p>
      <p>Hacked accounts have appeared on the dark web for as little as $3 a pop — less than half the $6.99 monthly price of a Disney+ subscription — in the week since the site’s Nov. 12 debut, multiple news reports say.</p>
      <p>While some viewers’ old username and password combinations may have been poached from other sites, many say their stolen login credentials were unique to Disney+, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-50461171">according to the BBC</a> and the news site ZDNet.</p>
      <p>Disney+ fans complained about being hacked on Twitter last week amid other gripes about <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/12/disney-streaming-service-plagued-with-glitches-on-first-day/">technical glitches and poor customer service</a>.</p>
      <p>“2 days in and my @disneyplus account was already hacked and stolen!” Jack Steen <a href="https://twitter.com/jakcst/status/1195754631470747648">said on Twitter</a>. “And the hack is so stupid simple to perform.”</p>
      <p>A Disney spokeswoman did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment. But the company <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/19/hacked-disney-plus-accounts-said-to-be-on-sale-according-to-reports.html">told CNBC</a> that it “takes the privacy and security of our users’ data very seriously and there is no indication of a security breach on Disney+.”</p>
      <p>Hackers may have snagged some login credentials from other data leaks and gotten others from users “infected with keylogging or info-stealing malware,” according to ZDNet, which was <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/thousands-of-hacked-disney-accounts-are-already-for-sale-on-hacking-forums/">first to reveal</a> the sales of hacked accounts.</p>
      <p>Disney said its answer to Netflix beat expectations by <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/13/disney-nets-10m-subscribers-beating-expectations/">snapping up 10 million subscribers</a> in its first day despite the technical difficulties, which the company attributed to high demand. The Disney+ catalog includes content from Disney, Pixar, Marvel and the “Star Wars” franchise.</p>
