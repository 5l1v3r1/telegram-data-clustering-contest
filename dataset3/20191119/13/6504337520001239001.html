      </p>
      <p><b>LATEST: Nov. 19, 1 p.m.:</b> Because of a shift in the weather forecast, the number of Pacific Gas and Electric customers who may lose power beginning Wednesday has been revised down.</p>
      <p>“Because this weather event continues to change and conditions remain dynamic the 24-hour notice of a PSPS is now expected to go out to a total of 171,581 customers,” PG&amp;E spokesperson Tamar Sarkisfian said Tuesday afternoon.</p>
      <p>
        <span dir="auto">Earlier today the utility said the deliberate blackout would impact up to 264,000 customers in 25 counties including eight in the Bay Area.</span>
      </p>
      <p>
        <span dir="auto">PG&amp;E hasn't provided a new list of potentially impacted counties but said shutoffs are most likely in the North Bay, North Valley (Butte, Glenn, Tehama Shasta counties and parts of Plumas County.) and the Sierra Foothills. Bay Area counties outside the North Bay are being monitored.</span>
      </p>
      <p><b>UPDATE: Nov. 19, 5:45 a.m.:</b> Pacific Gas and Electric added Santa Clara, San Mateo and Santa Cruz counties to the list of areas where some customers may lose power this week to reduce wildfire risk during expected dry, windy weather.</p>
      <p>In total, PG&amp;E estimates 39,000 customers — or 117,000 people if you assume an average of three residents per household — could go in the dark in these three counties, according to a <a href="http://investor.pgecorp.com/news-events/press-releases/press-release-details/2019/Customers-Notified-That-High-Winds-and-Dry-Conditions-on-Wednesday-May-Prompt-PGE-to-Call-a-Public-Safety-Power-Shutoff/default.aspx">press release issued Monday night</a>. PG&amp;E notified customers about a potential Public Safety Power Shutoff (PSPS) in these counties yesterday.</p>
      <p>In addition, PG&amp;E  has already alerted 264,000 other California customers that the utility may begin cutting power early Wednesday. That brings the total impact up to 303,000 customers — or approximately 909,000 residents.</p>
      <p>The list of counties that may be affected now stands at 25 and includes: Alameda, Butte, Colusa, Contra Costa, El Dorado, Glenn, Lake, Marin, Mendocino, Napa, Nevada, Placer, Plumas, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, Shasta, Sierra, Solano, Sonoma, Sutter, Tehama, Trinity, Yolo and Yuba.</p>
      <p>Shutoffs will take place in phases from Wednesday morning through Wednesday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Blustery conditions are expected to develop early in the morning Wednesday (Nov. 20) and continue into Thursday morning with sustained winds of up to 25 mph and isolated gusts up to 55 mph at elevations above 1,000 feet in the hills. Northern California has seen well below-average rainfall this season and the concern is the winds can damage equipment and spark wildfires that spread quickly in a dry landscape.</p>
      <p>"Average precipitation in the Northern Sierra by this point in November is typically 5 inches; this year, that region has received 0.3 inches of precipitation," PG&amp;E said in a statement. "Temperatures in PG&amp;E’s service territory are 5 to 15 degrees above average for this time of year."</p>
      <p>PG&amp;E has begun notifying potentially affected customers by phone, text and email about the shutoff. The utility will alert them again 24 hours and 4 hours prior to when power is cut.</p>
      <p>PG&amp;E will begin to inspect equipment after winds have subsided on Thursday and hasn't released a timeline for when power will return.</p>
      <p>The news comes after PG&amp;E cut power three separate times in October to reduce wildfire risk. The utility says that since the last preemptive power outages, their site and call center have been bolstered to handle increased traffic; the PG&amp;E outage site repeatedly went down during previous PSPS events.</p>
