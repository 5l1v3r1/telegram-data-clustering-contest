      <h1>Seed farms being established in 450 hectares</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:44:29+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Special-Correspondent-Ramanathapuram-20639/" target="_blank">Special Correspondent Ramanathapuram</a></address>
      <p>As quality seeds have always helped farmers to increase the yield, the Agriculture department has identified 450 hectares for land for establishing seed farms of different paddy varieties to produce about 900 metric tonnes of quality seeds.</p>
      <p>Apart from various other activities, the Agriculture department has laid special emphasis on producing quality seeds by encouraging farmers to establish seed farms, employing efficient, effective and latest technologies to supply quality seeds to farmers.</p>
      <p>Deputy Director of Agriculture (State scheme) S. S .Shaiek Abdullah, who was looking after seed farms and area of cultivation, said the department after setting up a target of 450 hectares had already established seed farms in 383 hectares, spread over all the 11 blocks in the district.</p>
      <p>After the department distributed the foundation seeds of paddy varieties such as RNR 15048, NLR 34449, CO 51, ADT 45, Jothi, IR 64 and BPT 5204, farmers have raised the crops in the seed farms. About 50% of the crops had reached the flowering stage and they would be ready for harvest by the end of this year or early January, he said.</p>
      <p>To monitor the health of crops, Mr. Abdullah held a review meeting here on Monday with Assistant Seed Officers (ASO) and offered them field standard training. The ASOs have been asked to ensure the crops in the seed farms were weed and pests free and the farms were well maintained. They have been asked to visit the farms periodically and remove the off-type plants, he said. He along with Assistant Director (certification) Sakthi Ganesh and ASOs inspected the seed farms of Durai Pandi and Ramakrishnan at Valayanendal in Paramakudi block on Monday.</p>
      <p>“As the district has been receiving good rainfall during this north east monsoon, we are aiming to produce 900 metric tonnes of seeds,” Mr Abdullah said. After the harvest, the seeds would be certified and distributed to farmers at subsidised rates, he said.</p>
      <p>This year, farmers have shown interest in cultivating RNR 15048, the new variety developed by Indian Institute of Rice Research (IIRR) in Hyderabad. A large number of farmers in Thiruvadanai block have cultivated the medium duration (120 days) superfine variety, he said.</p>
