        <b>First published in the <i>Sydney Morning Herald</i> on June 9, 1959</b>
      </p>
      <p>The United Nations has now produced a draft Declaration of the Rights of the Child.</p>
      <p>The draft has been adopted by the Social Commission, the Economic and Social Council, and the Commission on Human Rights, and is now ready to go before the General Assembly.</p>

      <p>As might have been expected, the declaration has been drawn up in general rather than specific terms. There is, for example, no specific reference to the sort of situation which arose in Victoria recently when parents refused a blood transfusion for their dying son. But a child, according to the declaration, "shall have the right to adequate nutrition, housing, recreation and medical services."</p>
      <p>The General Assembly will be asked to proclaim this and other rights so that the child "may have a happy childhood and be enabled to grow up to enjoy for his own good and for the good of society the fundamental rights and freedoms, particularly those specified in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights." To this end, the child shall enjoy special protection by law, and the benefits of social security. During discussion in the Commission on Human Rights, the Soviet Union proposed that every child should be entitled to free medical services, but this amendment was rejected.</p>

      <p>The declaration proclaims that the child shall, save where his best interests require otherwise, grow up in the care of his parents, and that a young child shall not, save in exceptional circumstances, be separated from his mother. A child is entitled from birth to a name and nationality, and to receive free and compulsory education, at least in the elementary stages. He shall in all circumstances be the first to receive protection and relief, and shall be brought up in an atmosphere which will "promote understanding, tolerance and friendship among peoples and national, racial and religious groups and aversion for all forms of national, racial or religious discrimination."</p>
      <p>If he is physically, mentally or socially handicapped, the child shall be given the special treatment, education and care required by his particular condition. Finally, the child shall be protected against all forms of neglect, cruelty and exploitation. The Soviet union also proposed that "in particular the child shall not he subjected to corporal punishment in schools," But the motion was defeated.</p>
