      <h1>Sick pet owner who stabbed and drowned dog is nailed by forensics in UK first</h1>
      <h2>Brendan Murphy brutally stabbed his dog and tied her to a breeze block before throwing her into the canal in Cheshire</h2>

      <p>A sick dog owner who stabbed and drowned his dog was busted by forensic evidence testing in an RSCPA investigation.</p>
      <p>Brendan Murphy, 52, claimed his Japanese Akita dog Tara died of natural causes and he buried the body in woodland.</p>
      <p>But Tara’s body was found floating in a canal and chained to a breeze block, prompting the RSPCA to launch an investigation into the death of the dog.</p>
      <p>Forensic tests on the dog’s bone marrow showed Tara had died as a result of drowning.</p>
      <p>A postmortem examination showed the dog had been stabbed twice before her body entered the canal.</p>

      <p>It also showed Tara had been suffering from an untreated lung disease for a number of weeks.</p>
      <p>Chester Magistrate's Court heard Tara's body was discovered in the Shropshire Union Canal near Nantwich, Cheshire, on October 6 last year.</p>
      <p>In a witness statement the vet told the court:  "It is my expert opinion that Tara was suffering as a result of underlying ill health at the time of her death.</p>
      <p>"It is further my expert opinion that Tara was alive when she was placed in the canal and that she was deliberately anchored down with a length of chain.</p>

      <p>"The cause of death in Tara is hence in my expert opinion drowning.</p>
      <p>"She was then stabbed in the abdomen twice before being thrown alive into the canal, where she drowned.</p>
      <p>"It is upsetting to think about what she must have endured during her final moments."</p>
      <p>The forensic evidence - used for the first time by the RSPCA - led to Murphy admitting three counts of unnecessary suffering to Tara.</p>
      <p>Murphy claimed his pet dog had died from natural causes and that he discovered her body had been dug up when he went to pay his respects around two weeks later.</p>
      <p>However, tests showed algae was present in the dog’s bone marrow indicating it had drowned around August 20 last year.</p>
      <p>Chester Magistrate's Court charged Murphy with a ten-week prison sentence, suspended for 12 months, banned from keeping animals for ten-years and ordered to pay £300 costs and a £115 victim surcharge.</p>
      <p>He was also convicted for failing to provide proper veterinary care.</p>
