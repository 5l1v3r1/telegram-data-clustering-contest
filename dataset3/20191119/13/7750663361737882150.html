      <p>The midfielder has enjoyed an excellent 2019-20 campaign with Liverpool, featuring in all but one of the club's Premier League games this term.</p>
      <p>However, Fabinho has struggled for constant starts at international level, receiving 11 caps since 2015, but did feature during Brazil's <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/argentina/result/result-lionel-messi-returns-as-argentina-defeat-brazil-in-saudi-arabia_379140.html">recent friendly with Argentina.</a></p>
      <p>Reflecting on the performances of Fabinho, Tite told <i>Goal</i>: "Fabinho has built a positive growing. All the times he played, he played very well.</p>
      <p>"And he brings confidence from his club to the Brazil national squad. In a natural way, and we can feel it. It's not that you can only see it, you can feel it. Fabinho is playing his normal football in a role that he also has at Liverpool."</p>
      <p>Former Liverpool defender <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jamie-carragher/"><b>Jamie Carragher</b></a> has claimed that Fabinho is currently the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/liverpool/news/carragher-hails-fabinho-as-best-in-league_370131.html">best defensive midfielder in the Premier League.</a></p>
      <p>The Brazilian will be expected to start for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jurgen-klopp/"><b>Jurgen Klopp</b></a>'s side when they resume domestic action against Crystal Palace on Saturday.</p>
