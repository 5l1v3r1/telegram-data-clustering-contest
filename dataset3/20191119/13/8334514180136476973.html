      <p>MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Tuesday that a U.S. decision to effectively back Israel’s right to build Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank undermined the legal basis for a settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>
      <p>U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Monday abandoned Washington’s four-decade-old position that such settlements were “inconsistent with international law.”</p>
      <p>Russia’s Foreign Ministry condemned the change of policy in a statement on Tuesday, warning the move would escalate tensions in the region.</p>
      <p>Moscow’s stance is that such settlements on Palestinian territory are illegal under international law, it said.</p>
