      <p>Shares of <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/hd-stock">Home Depot</a> fell as much as 7.5% in early trading Tuesday after the company reported third-quarter earnings results that missed Wall Street’s expectations.</p>
      <p>Here’s what the company reported versus what analysts at Bloomberg expected:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Earnings per share:</b> $2.53 reported versus $2.53 (expected)</li>
        <li><b>Revenue:</b> $27.22 billion reported versus $27.72 billion (expected)</li>
        <li><b>Same-store sales:</b> +3.6% reported versus 4.6% (expected)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The company also cut its full-year outlook for the rest of 2019, saying that some of its business investments, including updates to its online shopping experience, haven’t yet benefited sales.</p>
      <p>Home Depot now expects full-year comparable sales to grow about 3.5%, where it previously had forecast about 4%. The company also trimmed its revenue outlook to growth of 1.8% from 2.3%, but maintained its expectation of earnings per share of about $10.03.</p>
      <p>“Sales were below our expectations driven by the timing of certain benefits associated with our One Home Depot strategic investments,” said Craig Menear, CEO of Home Depot, <a href="https://ir.homedepot.com/news-releases/2019/11-19-2019-110010761">in a press release</a>.</p>
      <p>He continued: “We are largely on track with these investments and have seen positive results, but some of the benefits anticipated for fiscal 2019 will take longer to realize than our initial assumptions.”</p>
      <p>It’s the second time that Home Depot has trimmed its full-year outlook recently. In its second-quarter earnings release, the company lowered its guidance, citing <a href="https://ir.homedepot.com/news-releases/2019/08-20-2019-110043066">continued lumber-price deflation and potential tariff impacts</a>.</p>
      <p>Shares of home-improvement competitor <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/low-stock">Lowe’s</a>, which is set to report earnings Wednesday, fell as much as 2.2% in early trading Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Home Depot hit a 52-week high of $239.31 during the day on Monday. It has a consensus target price of $235.70 and 19 “buy” ratings, 14 “hold” ratings, and two “sell” ratings, according to Bloomberg data.</p>
      <p>Home Depot is up <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/hd-stock">39% this year through Monday’s close.</a></p>
