      <h1>Victoria youth can pick up free December bus passes starting today</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:48:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:48</time> by <a rel="author">Lindsay Kines</a></address>
      <p>Victoria youth 18 years and younger can start picking up their free December transit bus passes from city hall beginning today.</p>
      <p>The program is only available to Victoria residents, so youth or their parents and guardians will have to provide documents that confirm their age and address.</p>
      <p>By next September, the city hopes to have a U-Pass program in place where young people will be able to use their student identification cards as bus passes, the way college and university students do.</p>
      <p>But, until then, youth will have to supply proof of age and residency in order to pick up their bus passes every month at city hall from Monday to Friday, 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.</p>
      <p>Victoria will spend $972,000 a year to buy passes for an estimated 7,200 youth in the city at a cost of $11.25-a-month each — whether they pick up their passes or not.</p>
      <p>City council plans to cover part of the cost with revenue from Sunday parking fees that took effect in May and are expected to bring in about $500,000 to $600,000 a year.</p>
      <p>Mayor Lisa Helps has said the program will encourage transit ridership and promote low-carbon transportation.</p>
      <p>“If we get kids riding transit, they’ll become lifelong transit riders and then they’ll encourage their parents and their grandparents and their elders to take the bus as well,” she told the Times Colonist after securing approval for the program from the Victoria Regional Transit Commission this month.</p>
      <p>“It’s a sustainable mode of transportation. It’s probably the most sustainable mode we have. The more people moving on the bus, the less people congesting the roads, and the better for everybody.”</p>
      <p>City officials said each monthly pass will permit unlimited rides on B.C. transit buses and handyDART services for registered handyDART customers. Replacements will not be provided for lost or stolen cards.</p>
      <p>The city says the following forms of identification are acceptable to confirm both age and City of Victoria residency:</p>
      <p>•B.C. Health Services Card with current address</p>
      <p>•B.C. Identification Card with current address</p>
      <p>•B.C. Driver’s Licence with current address</p>
      <p>If a youth does not have one of the above with a Victoria address, the following documents are accepted to prove age and residency.</p>
      <p>Proof of Age:</p>
      <p>• Birth certificate</p>
      <p>• Passport</p>
      <p>• Indigenous and Northern Affairs Status Card</p>
      <p>• International Student Identification Card</p>
      <p>Proof of Residency:</p>
      <p>Any two (2) of the following documents:</p>
      <p>• Current property tax statement</p>
      <p>• Current home owner insurance documents</p>
      <p>• Current renter insurance documents</p>
      <p>• Current Utility Bill with address (City of Victoria, B.C. Hydro, Shaw, Telus, etc.)</p>
      <p>• Current Canadian bank statement with address</p>
      <p>• Current credit card statement with address</p>
      <p>• Current B.C. Vehicle registration with address</p>
      <p>• Valid B.C. Driver’s license with address</p>
      <p>• Valid B.C. Identification card with address</p>
      <p>• Purchase agreement for home</p>
      <p>• A rental agreement or lease signed with landlord’s contact phone number</p>
      <p>• Current year property Notice of Assessment (B.C. Assessment)</p>
      <p>• Income tax notice of assessment issued in current year</p>
