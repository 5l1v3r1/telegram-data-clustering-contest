      <h3>Seagate Storage Discounted on the Microsoft Store Ahead of Black Friday</h3>
      <p>By <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/author/Sam+Quirke">Sam Quirke</a>, 19 Nov 2019<br/>Comments<br/>Black Friday hasn't officially kicked off for most retailers yet – the Xbox Black Friday 2019 event doesn't start until Thursday November 21st, and even then the deals are only available for Gold subscribers. Yet we've picked up some <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/products/hardware">hardware deals</a> ahead of the busiest shopping spree of the year. Specifically, Seagate storage solutions have had a price cut. They're not the most significant price drops we've seen – more on that after the Seagate deals table – but if you really want to be kitted out with the latest Xbox branded options, Seagate's official SSD range is probably the way to go.</p>

      <p>Of course, it's always worth shopping around. Even though we're ahead of Black Friday, Amazon is already beating the Xbox discounts on a few of these – provided you don't mind missing out on the specific Xbox decal. You can get a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Game-Drive-Green-STEA2000403/dp/B01065S79E?SubscriptionId=AKIAIR4HVRUPV72R52YQ&amp;tag=trueachi0b-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953">Seagate Xbox branded 2TB Game Drive for $77.99</a>, already a couple of dollars cheaper than Microsoft's offer if you don't mind green instead of white.</p>
      <p>You can go a step further and go for an external drive that's not specifically tailored for game use – with a little setup savvy, we've had no issues using the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Portable-External-Hard-Drive/dp/B07CRG94G3?SubscriptionId=AKIAIR4HVRUPV72R52YQ&amp;tag=trueachi0b-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=2025&amp;creative=165953">Seagate Portable 2TB External Hard Drive</a> or the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Western-Digital-Elements-Portable-External/dp/B06W55K9N6">Western Digital 2TB Elements Portable External Hard Drive</a>, both of which are only $59.99 on Amazon US. Once again, bearing in mind that we're not even into Black Friday yet, we personally think it's worth holding out for better deals away from the Xbox branded stuff – unless the brand is really your thing. We're not going to judge!</p>
      <p>We recently received word of the full <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/n39731/xbox-black-friday">Xbox Black Friday plan</a> from the publisher themselves – Xbox Live Gold members can expect discounts on the digital game store from Thursday 21st, with everyone else piling in on the 24th. Microsoft are planning on discounting consoles and controllers on that Sunday too, for the duration of the Black Friday period – which ends with Cyber Monday on December 2nd.</p>
