      <p>ULSTER HAVE CONFIRMED a number of injury setbacks following their Champions Cup opener on Saturday. </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.the42.ie/ulster-beat-bath-champions-cup-4894248-Nov2019/">The province claimed a 17-16 win over Bath at The Rec last weekend</a>, to begin their Pool 3 campaign on a positive note. </p>
      <p>However, prop Jack McGrath is set to undergo surgery on a thumb injury and the Ireland international’s availability to play will be “monitored over the coming weeks”. </p>
      <p>Lock Sam Carter was substituted off after 26 minutes after suffering a dislocated shoulder, which will put him out for approximately three months after he goes under the knife. </p>
      <p>A shoulder injury sustained in the same game will see winger Rob Lyttle miss between six and eight weeks, while back-rower Marcus Rea is also set to be sidelined for around six weeks after fracturing his jaw playing for Ballynahinch. </p>

      <p>Meanwhile, fly-half Billy Burns has signed a two-year contract extension with Ulster, keeping him at Kingspan Stadium until the summer of 2022. </p>
      <p>“Since joining Ulster last summer, I’ve made it my home and have really enjoyed my time here,” Burns said. “The support I’ve had has been incredible and we have a great group of players, so it was a no-brainer for me to extend my contract.</p>
