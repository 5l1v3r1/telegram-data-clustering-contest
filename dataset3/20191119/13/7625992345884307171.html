      <p>"Sunday Morning" contributor Faith Salie offers a holiday recipe from her mom:</p>
      <p>"My mother used to faithfully deliver loaves of this bread during the holiday seasons to the local jail when I was a child. The prisoners, possessing gratitude but not overly discriminating taste buds, nicknamed my young mom 'The Gingerbread Lady.'</p>
      <p>"As regular as the leaves falling from the trees, the smells of her pumpkin bread filled our home for months during the fall and winter. I think of her every time I bake it, especially with my kids – the grandchildren she never got to meet, but who know it's 'GG's pumpkin bread' that we're baking together."</p>
      <h3>Gail's Pumpkin Bread</h3>
      <p>
        <i>Ingredients:</i>
      </p>
      <p>4 cups all-purpose flour<br/>3 cups sugar<br/>1 can pumpkin (15 oz.)<br/>4 eggs<br/>2/3 cup water<br/>1 cup oil (I use vegetable oil)<br/>1 teaspoon cinnamon <br/>1 teaspoon allspice<br/>1 teaspoon cloves<br/>1 teaspoon ground ginger<br/>1 teaspoon nutmeg<br/>1 teaspoon baking powder<br/>2 teaspoons baking soda<br/>1 1/2 teaspoon salt</p>
      <p>[I throw caution to the wind and measure all my spices as heaping teaspoons.]</p>
      <p>
        <i>Preparation:</i>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Throw it all in a mixer into a single big bowl and mix until just blended.</li>
        <li>Spray baking pans and bake at 350°. Time it depending on size of pan – the small size loaf pan is about 35 minutes of baking; the larger loaf pans are closer to 50 minutes. (I just keep checking for doneness – or let my kids use the cake tester, which they find very exciting.)</li>
      </ul>
