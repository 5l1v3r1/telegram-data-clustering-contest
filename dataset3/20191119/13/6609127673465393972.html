        <b>LOUIS SAHA has revealed Gary Neville predicted he'd miss from the spot against Celtic in the Champions League.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The duo were starring for Manchester United on that famous night in 2006 that <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/">Hoops</a> fans will never forget.</p>

      <p>Shunsuke Nakamura netted an unforgettable free-kick before a late Artur Boruc penalty save secured three huge European points at Parkhead.</p>
      <p>Glasgow's East End was rocking as 60,000 fans celebrated the missed effort from 12-yards.</p>
      <p>And Saha admits he was raging after reading what his team-mate has said in the newspaper.</p>
      <p>He told <a href="https://www.fourfourtwo.com/">FourFourTwo:</a> "The worst memory about it is that my own team-mate, Gary Neville, actually predicted I'd miss the penalty!</p>

      <p>"He said that to someone, then I read it in a newspaper - I was fuming!</p>
      <p>"But with Gary, we argued a lot, so no change there.</p>
      <p>"It's about how you react, and the following weekend I scored against Chelsea , one of the best goals I scored in my career."</p>
      <p>That last-minute penalty save earned Gordon Strachan's men a place in the Champions League knockout stages.</p>
      <p>And 13 years on from the cagey affair at Parkhead, Saha has praised Boruc for his stop.</p>
      <p>He added: "Of course, I have to credit Celtic 's goalkeeper for the penalty.</p>
      <p>"It was a good save."</p>
