      <p>An update to Sony’s patent has offered new clues as to what the PS5’s mysterious cartridge is and it may be an expensive propriety storage medium.</p>
      <p>Patents have revealed a lot of interesting details about the PlayStation 5 so far, including a pretty comprehensive look at the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/ps5-controller-patent-reveals-dualshock-5-gamepad-no-light-bar-11176991/">DualShock 5 controller</a>, but the one for what looks like an <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/11/ps5-will-use-cartridges-reveals-unlikely-new-patent-11078727/">old school game cartridge</a> has been a bit of a mystery.</p>
      <p>It’s obviously not for games in the retro sense of the concept but the best guess up till now is that it’s some kind of storage expansion for when the console’s internal SSD just isn’t enough.</p>
      <p>Thanks to a new update to the patent that theory seems to have been reinforced, although it doesn’t appear to be anything directly to do with the SSD but instead a separate, propriety technology.</p>

      <p>The translation of the new information, according to <a href="https://www.psu.com/news/ps5-ssd-expandable-storage-likely-confirmed-new-information-added-to-existing-patent/">PlayStation Universe</a> is as follows, with renders of what the final cartridge might look like by <a href="https://nl.letsgodigital.org/spelcomputers-games/sony-playstation-5-ssd-opslagmedium/">LetsGoDigital</a>:</p>

      <p>‘This is a recording medium which can record various data, such as a character, an image, an animation, a sound and a program. By loading the opening provided by the game console with the tip end part by which a variety of pins of this cartridge were provided, the various data recorded on this cartridge can be read.’</p>
      <p>Sony has never used cartridges before in its consoles but it has used all manner of bespoke memory cards, most of which have been stupidly expensive – the worst examples being the ones for the PS Vita that were so costly they put people off the whole console.</p>
      <p>You would’ve hoped they learned their lesson with that one but going by the, possibly incomplete, information in the patent, extra storage for the PlayStation 5 could end up being unwelcomingly expensive.</p>
