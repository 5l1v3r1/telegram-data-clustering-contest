      <h1>Gender equality scorecard shows health and caring jobs not highly valued</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:36:51+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/alison-branley/6470766" target="_blank">Alison Branley</a></address>
      <p>Watching her grandfather die of cancer, Elena Singh knew she had found her calling in nursing.</p>
      <h3>Key points:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>National report shows the difference between men's and women's pay continues to narrow slowly, but is still $25,679</li>
        <li>Experts are concerned the pay gap in the health and caring sector is stubbornly sitting at 15.9 per cent</li>
        <li>Potential solutions include a workplace pay gap analysis, training and flexibility in managerial roles</li>
      </ul>
      <p>"As a family, we sort of helped care for him," she said.</p>
      <p>"I started working in aged care and that's when I found my passion."</p>
      <p>With a bachelor's degree and two years of work behind her, she takes home about $75,000 annually with penalty rates.</p>
      <p>But if the 25-year-old stays on the wards for the next decade, her experience, annual training updates and hard work won't add up to much more than $90,000 a year plus penalties.</p>
      <p>"The work that we do is perhaps not as appreciated as what it should be," she said.</p>
      <p>"The reason why we do what we do is because we love it and we have a passion for it."</p>
      <p>Ms Singh is one of the many nurses and carers who represent the industry with one of the most stubborn gender pay gaps in Australia.</p>
      <h3>The Gender Divide:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Australia's Gender Equality Scorecard is based on data from 40 per cent of the workforce, specifically private sector employers with more than 100 workers</li>
        <li>The Health and Social Assistance gender pay gap closed by 0.2 percentage points in 2019 but has stagnated at about 16 per cent for six years</li>
        <li>There's been growth in workplaces with parental leave for male, or secondary, carers (43.8 per cent) and those with a flexible working strategy (72.7 per cent) but the number setting targets for engaging men in those strategies was just 2.3 per cent</li>
      </ul>
      <p>An annual report card that looks at nearly half of Australia's workplaces has found across all industries that men are still taking home, on average, $25,000 more a year than women.</p>
      <p>The Gender Equality Scorecard by the Workplace Gender Equality Agency this year found the pay gap in the health and social assistance sector is at 15.9 per cent.</p>
      <p>The health care and social assistance sector is Australia's largest employer and includes men and women working in the health and caring sector, including aged care, private hospitals, senior medical roles in those hospitals and management.</p>
      <p>It also takes into account private GP clinics, disability support providers and even child care.</p>
      <p>Experts say a key contributing factor is that in an industry made up of 80 per cent women, women make up only 65 per cent of its well-paid senior managers and 40 per cent of its chief executives.</p>
      <p>But others question why those working on the front line — including nurses, social workers and even childcare workers — should be earning less than those in managerial positions.</p>

      <h3>Women shouldn't have to stop caring to earn more: nurses</h3>
      <p>Ms Singh is just returning to work after having her first child and says she does not want her career to go beyond the wards of aged care homes.</p>
      <blockquote>"I wouldn't like to see myself lose too much contact with the patients because, at the end of the day, that's where my passion is," she said.</blockquote>
      <p>The young mother has considered going back to university to increase her chances of moving up the ladder.</p>
      <p>Living on the outskirts of Adelaide while at university, she recalls how she had to take a two-and-half-hour commute to get to the required clinical placements, without pay.</p>
      <p>Now, she would have to balance it with child care and her partner's hours.</p>

      <p>As such, balancing shift work and family responsibilities made going into the higher ranks of the health sector seem out of reach.</p>
      <p>"It's been a challenge to be able to make our lives fit around work," she said.</p>
      <p>"I don't want to study to take even more time away from my family."</p>
      <h3>Women don't have the market cornered on caring</h3>
      <p>Workplace Gender Equality Agency director Libby Lyons said the stubbornness of the gender pay gap in the health and caring sector worried her.</p>
      <p>"We really need the health sector to have a good hard look at themselves," she said.</p>
      <blockquote>"I think perhaps the sector believes that because it's female dominated, it doesn't have to do anything."</blockquote>
      <p>Ms Lyons also had a unique solution for the industry, saying getting more women at the top also involved having more men at the bottom.</p>
      <p>"Women don't have the market cornered on caring," she said.</p>
      <p>"The sector needs to start attracting men into the lower levels rather than just at management."</p>
      <p>This was because it enabled more women to return to the workforce if their partner contributed to caring responsibilities.</p>

      <p>"We know that men are the key to flexible work here and gender balance in our workplaces," she said.</p>
      <p>Ms Singh said the reason moving up the executive chain was also unappealing to her, and some of her colleagues, were issues like lack of flexible work, which was identified in this year's report.</p>
      <p>"We look after people 24 hours a day and at any time managers might be called upon for any particular reason," she said.</p>
      <p>The Adelaide woman warned people should not interpret women's career choices as a lack of ambition.</p>
      <p>"Women are ambitious, but I think that perhaps women still think 'well, I wouldn't be considered because I've got a family'."</p>
      <h3>From renal nurse to responsible for renal clinics</h3>
      <p>Jodie Cooper understands the need for this flexibility in order to move up the career ladder.</p>
      <p>Like many in health care, Jodie Cooper started out more than two decades ago as a graduate nurse working the wards in St Vincent's Hospital in Melbourne.</p>
      <p>Newly married and finding it "tough financially" she quickly moved into dialysis and it was this expert knowledge that eventually saw her become a Nurse Unit Manager (NUM).</p>
      <p>"I never wanted to be anything but a nurse," she said.</p>
      <p>"It was just being with and looking after people."</p>

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>By the time her two daughters, Kayla and Ebony, were in primary school, the long hours and responsibility of running a ward became too much.</p>
      <p>"I missed so much of their school activities and sports days because my job was very regimented," she said.</p>
      <p>Ms Cooper also identified one of the sticking points for women in the health sector: as a manager who worked during the day, her pay packet did not attract the penalty rates her nurses did.</p>
      <p>So she made the switch to the private sector of the health industry where her nursing background equipped her to sell dialysis machines to hospitals.</p>
      <blockquote>"Moving into industry gave me a lot more flexibility, being able to plan my appointments around what suited me," she said.</blockquote>
      <p>In her 13 years at Baxter, she says flexible working has also included being encouraged to move around the company, take part in training and even salary sacrifice so she could take more leave to look after her daughters on school holidays.</p>
      <p>Now, aged 47, Ms Cooper is the operations and business development manager at Baxter Health Care and oversees some dialysis clinics the company is involved with.</p>
      <p>"I think for women to be successful you need to give them that flexibility."</p>
      <h3>Industry starting to slowly respond</h3>
      <p>Australian Healthcare and Hospitals Association chief executive Alison Verhoeven said the industry recognised the gap was a problem and there were projects underway to deal with it.</p>
      <p>It included a program in Victoria that was promoting diversity on health boards.</p>
      <blockquote>"It's not just about women, it's about men as well. We need to be encouraging men to undertake part-time work," she said.</blockquote>
      <p>"The second mechanism is being open to supporting women coming back to work."</p>
      <p>Ms Verhoeven would also like to see the industry do more reporting about the pay gap.</p>
      <p>She said offering managers the opportunity to continue to be part of the clinical setting could also help.</p>
      <p>"Some of that does happen but there's much more to do."</p>
