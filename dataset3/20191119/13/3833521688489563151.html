      <h1>The Daily Chase: CN Rail workers walk off the job; TSX hot streak snapped</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:49:30+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/talent/noah-zivitz-1.451955" target="_blank">Noah Zivitz</a></address>
      <p>More than 3,000 conductors and railyard workers at CN Rail walked off the job shortly after midnight; in a brief statement, Teamsters Canada said negotiations to resolve the dispute are continuing. BNN Bloomberg's Paige Ellis is gathering reaction from major Canadians industries that rely on CN to haul their goods, and will find out what some top economists have to say about when the strike could dent GDP. We’ll also keep tabs on CN management comments at a Scotia conference this morning.</p>

        <b>TSX STREAK SNAPPED</b>
      </p>
      <p>The TSX Composite’s winning streak was brought to a halt yesterday after 11 straight days of gains that propelled the index above 17,000 points. While not the biggest drags, pot producers weighed on Bay Street as Aurora Cannabis, Aphria and Hexo suffered double-digit declines Monday. </p>

        <b>CIBC LEAVES BAY ST. 'SCRATCHING THEIR HEADS'</b>
      </p>
      <p>Great piece from Doug Alexander at Bloomberg News today on how Victor Dodig’s CIBC has struggled to deliver a message that resonates with investors. “People are scratching their heads, trying to figure out exactly where things are heading,” is what Analyst John Aiken told Doug. We’ll explore what it’ll take to swing sentiment.   </p>

        <b>TC ENERGY SEES SLOWER DIVIDEND GROWTH</b>
      </p>
      <p>The pipeline operator said today it expects average dividend growth to slow to a 5-7 per cent annual rate after 2021 from its target of 8-10 per cent annual payout growth up til that point. The company formerly known as TransCanada said it’s “methodically” advancing the Bruce Power extension and Keystone XL and says those projects would bolster the company’s growth outlook if they see the light of day. We’ll monitor developments at TC’s investor day, which could be overshadowed to a certain extent by the recent Keystone spill in North Dakota and renewed political pressure in the U.S. as a pair of top Democrats call for a formal regulatory review of TC in the wake of that incident.</p>
