      <p>Tottenham are reportedly in talks over a stunning swap deal to sign Karim Benzema from Real Madrid.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/1206355/Tottenham-Real-Madrid-Transfer-Karim-Benzema-Harry-Kane-Premier-League">According to reports in Spain, as cited on the Express</a>, Harry Kane could head to the Bernabeu as part of a deal that would see the Frenchman join the Premier League side.</p>
      <p>Chelsea and Tottenham have both been <a href="https://readchelsea.com/2019/11/12/chelsea-and-tottenham-linked-with-surprise-benzema-moves/">linked</a> with possible January moves to sign Benzema recently, but it looks like Spurs could be stepping up their interest.</p>
      <p>There is still some way to go for a deal to be done, however, with the report adding that Florentino Perez believes the striker is only worth £120 million, a fee lower than the asking price that has been set by the London club.</p>

      <p>Both Chelsea and Tottenham have been linked with moves to reinforce their striking options in recent months, with concerns that Kane may leave at the end of the season.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Chelsea appear keen to add some competition for Tammy Abraham in the final third.</p>
