      <h1>Careem to launch bicycle-sharing system across Dubai</h1>
      <h2>New deal with RTA will bring 3,500 bicycles to Dubai</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:27:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:27</time> by <a rel="author">Darragh Murphy</a></address>
      <p>Not in the mood for traffic? Careem’s new transport system with <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/news/423025-dubai-named-the-worlds-second-best-city-to-drive-in">Dubai's Road</a>s and Transport Authority (RTA) means you can wave those worries away.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/news/422673-rta-to-bring-faster-hala-e-hailing-service-to-dubai-this-december">ride-hailing app</a> recently signed a deal with RTA to launch a new <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/things-to-do/407013-cycle-at-al-qudra">bike</a>-sharing system, bringing 3,500 bicycles across 350 smart docking stations throughout Dubai.</p>
      <p>The service, which is the first bicycle-pool phased programme of its kind in the <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/things-to-do">city</a>, can be used through the Careem Bike app, where cyclists can hire and pay for <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/things-to-do/407013-cycle-at-al-qudra">bike rides</a>.</p>
      <p>A smart system will be used to track <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/attractions/397663-where-to-cycle-skate-and-scoot-in-dubai-2019">bicycles</a>, see high occupancy areas and connect all bikes through GPS.</p>
      <p>Where can you find them? Solar-powered bike racks will be placed in Dubai Marina, throughout Jumeirah, the Dubai Water Canal, Deira, Al Khawaneej and Al Qudra.</p>
      <p>That’s not all though, as they’ll also be found along safe roads in Al Qusais, Al Mankhoul, Al Karama, and Al Barsha district areas.</p>
      <p>To start, Careem will operate 1,750 bikes and install 175 stations during the first two years, and add up to 3,500 bicycles across 350 smart docking stations in the following five years.</p>
      <p>Dubai currently has cycling tracks extending 274km, and RTA will continue to construct a total length of 631.7km by 2023. That’s a lot of ground to cover.</p>
      <p>“Careem Bike offers mobility means to riders of buses, metro and tram in Dubai covering the first and last mile. Moreover, biking is a healthy practice that eases the congestion in the city and pro-motes healthy lifestyles,” said co-founder and CEO of Careem Mudassir Sheikha.</p>
      <p>“Careem’s new partnership with RTA will be a great and exciting addition to the local transit net-work with the launch of Careem Bike service.”</p>
