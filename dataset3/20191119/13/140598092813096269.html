      <h1>Sweden drops rape investigation into Wikileaks founder Julian Assange</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:19:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/richard-orange/" target="_blank">Richard Orange</a></address>
      <p>Swedish prosecutors have dropped their long-running investigation into sexual offences allegedly committed by Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, judging that witnesses' memories are too hazy to corroborate his accuser's account after nine years. </p>
      <p>"After completing the investigation over the summer and autumn, it is now clear that oral testimony supporting the claimant's account has weakened," Eva-Marie Persson, Deputy Director of Public Prosecution, told a press conference in Stockholm on Tuesday afternoon. </p>
      <p>"This is mostly due to the length of time that has passed since the events. Naturally, memories fade." </p>
      <p>Since reopening the case in May, Ms Persson had interviewed seven witnesses but had yet to question Mr Assange himself.  </p>
      <p>The decision not to press charges comes as the 48-year-old activist remains in London's Belmarsh prison awaiting a hearing next February over possible extradition to the US, where he faces 18 criminal charges related to Wikileaks' 2010 release of thousands of classified documents detailing US military activity in Iraq and Afghanistan. </p>
      <p>After the announcement, Nils Melzer, UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, called for an urgent investigation into Sweden's treatment of Mr Assange, arguing that it had always been "inevitable" that the investigation would be discontinued, given "its gross arbitrariness". </p>

      <p>In a press release announcing her decision, however, Ms Persson stressed that she had found the account given by Mr Assange's accuser “credible and reliable” and her statements “coherent, extensive and detailed”. </p>
      <p>However in cases where guilt comes down to whose account is more credible, the accuser's or the alleged perpetrator's, she explained, additional corroborative evidence is required under Swedish law. </p>
      <p>The case was first launched in August 2010 after two women visited a police station to report the Australian for sexual offences.  </p>
      <p>Anna Ardin, who had helped arrange Mr Assange's trip and allowed him to stay in her Stockholm apartment, accused him of "doing something" to a condom so that it ripped while they were having sex. </p>
      <p>The second woman, whose name has yet to be made public, accused Mr Assange of having unprotected sex with her while she was sleeping next to him, even though she had previously insisted on him using a condom. Under Swedish law, this is classed as "minor rape". </p>
      <p>Mr Assange has always denied both allegations. The statute of limitations on Ms Ardin’s allegation expired in 2015, and in 2017, a Swedish prosecutor closed the second case, only for it to be reopened again following Mr Assange's arrest by UK police earlier this year. </p>
      <p>Elisabeth Massi Fritz, the lawyer for Mr Assange's unnamed accuser, said she disagreed with the decision to lay down the case. </p>
      <p>"Both my own and my client's judgement is that that my client's account is supported by solid written evidence," she said in a statement sent to Sweden's TT newswire.  </p>
      <p>"If the former prosecutors in the case had held deeper and more thoroughgoing interviews, we would have had high-quality interviews we could still use today. Sadly, that wasn't the case." </p>

      <p>Mr Assange's Swedish lawyer Per E Samuelson said that he believed Mr Assange's high profile at the time the case was launched had skewed the way he was treated. </p>
      <p>"It went awry from the start and I can't think of any other reason than that he was so famous," he told TT.</p>
      <p>"They delayed this investigation by many years," Mr Samuelson said. "Considering the situation he's in today I'm not sure if this plays such a big role anymore. He is completely focused now on resisting the extradition request from the USA. And I think his faith in the Swedish justice system disappeared many years ago."</p>
      <p>The case was launched a month after Wikileaks released 92,000 documents related to the Afghan War. </p>
      <p>A month after the case was launched, Wikileaks leaked 400,000 documents relating to the Iraq war, and the following month released a massive trove of US diplomatic cables.</p>
      <p>The first prosecutor to open the investigation laid it down after a few weeks, citing lack of evidence, only for a second prosecutor to reopen the investigation a month later, meaning this is the third time the case has been discontinued. </p>
