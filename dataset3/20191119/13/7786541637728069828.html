      <p><b>GENEVA (AP)</b> - The U.N. human rights office says it's "very concerned" about U.S. President Donald Trump's exoneration of three U.S. servicemen accused of war crimes, calling one pardon in a pending case "particularly troubling."</p>
      <p>Office spokesman Rupert Colville said Tuesday the moves "run against the letter and the spirit of international law" requiring accountability for such violations and send a "disturbing signal" to military forces worldwide.</p>
      <p>One of the pardons announced Friday went to Maj. Mathew Golsteyn, a former Green Beret accused of killing a suspected bomb-maker in Afghanistan in 2010. Golsteyn believed the man was a legal target and was responsible for an explosion that killed two U.S. Marines.</p>
      <p>Colville called that pardon "particularly troubling" because it cut short judicial processes. Golsteyn was to stand trial by court-martial in February.</p>
