      <p>Apart from a few tiny revisions in iOS 7 and later, iOS’ <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/notifications/">notification</a> badge system has appeared mostly unchanged since its conception. Jailbreakers seeking a fresher take on notification badges would do good to check out a newly released <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/jailbreak-apps-tweaks/">jailbreak tweak</a> called <b>CozyBadges</b> by iOS developer <i>NoisyFlake</i>.</p>
      <p>As depicted in the multitude of screenshot examples above, CozyBadges replaces the traditional red circular notification <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/badge/">badge</a> with something much more subtle — an updated icon label that appears highlighted or colorized when there are missed notifications. Moreover, the label can be configured to display alternative text, assuming the user wants this.</p>
      <p>The concept should be vaguely familiar because CozyBadges is a lot like one of NoisyFlake’s previous tweaks called <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/04/10/goodges-2/">Goodges2</a>. Worthy of note is that CozyBadges seems to have slightly different configuration options, and is fully-compatible with iOS 13 pwned with <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/checkra1n/">checkra1n</a>.</p>
      <p>Upon installing CozyBadges, users will find a new preference pane in the Settings app where they can configure it to their liking:</p>

      <p>Here, you can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Toggle CozyBadges on or off on demand</li>
        <li>Hide application labels</li>
        <li>Enable the tweak for <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/tag/dock/">Dock</a>-based icons</li>
        <li>Hide Dock application labels</li>
        <li>Enable or disable label background color (highlighting)</li>
        <li>Automatically color label backgrounds based on the app icon</li>
        <li>Manually configure a specific color for label backgrounds if automatic coloring doesn’t float your boat</li>
        <li>Enable or disable text color</li>
        <li>Automatically color label text based on the app icon</li>
        <li>Manually configure a specific color for labels if automatic coloring isn’t your cup of tea</li>
        <li>Enable or disable label text replacement system-wide or on a per-app basis</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The developer provides a Respring button at the top right of the preference pane to help you save any changes you make.</p>
      <p>Those interested in trying CozyBadges can <a href="https://repo.packix.com/package/com.noisyflake.cozybadges/">purchase the tweak for $1.99 from the Packix repository</a> in their package manager of choice. The tweak is only compatible with <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/jailbreak/">jailbroken</a> iOS 13 devices, so anyone on a previous version of iOS may want to use Goodges2 instead.</p>
