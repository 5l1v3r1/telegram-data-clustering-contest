      <h1>Irish-designed headguard is the first approved for World Rugby's new trial</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:13:47+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:13</time> by <a rel="author">Online Editors</a></address>
      <p>An Irish-designed headguard has become the first to be approved by World Rugby for its five-year trial designed to help reduce injury risk.</p>
      <p>World Rugby’s trial has been devised to allow approved manufacturers to gather further scientific evidence during games and the N-Pro has been approved for use after it was scientifically proven it can provide significant impact protection.</p>
      <p>Utilising defentex technology, N-Pro is designed to reduce the g-force energy transferred to a player’s head during impact, which is one of the major factors in sports-induced brain injury. N-Pro manages g-force impact energy through its multi-layer construction. The product has undergone extensive testing.</p>
      <p>This includes bench testing, simulated conditions-of-use tests, simulated ageing tests, fatigue tests, biomechanical tests, three-dimensional finite element computational modelling, pre-clinical studies and clinical feasibility studies by independent experts and independent test laboratories.</p>
      <p>Professor Michael Gilchrist, a biomechanics expert from University College Dublin, who has been leading an independent finite element study on N-Pro, said: “Computational modelling has allowed us to advance testing beyond standard ‘drop tests’ by replicating the stresses and strains that a player’s brain tissue is subjected to during a game scenario in a more realistic way.</p>

      <p>“The initial results have shown that the N-Pro head guard will provide a clear and quantifiable level of protection against head impact if worn while playing a contact sport such as rugby.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.n-pro.com/">N-Pro founder Mark Ganly</a> added: “We are delighted to be working with World Rugby on this innovative global headgear trial. N-Pro has been designed to reduce the risk of injury to rugby players by efficiently managing head impact energy.</p>
      <p>“Our research and development has been built upon rigorous scientific data. This global trial allows us to observe the performance of N-Pro and gather live match data from all levels of the game.”</p>

      <p>World Rugby’s outgoing chief medical officer, Martin Raftery, added: “<a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/news/world-rugby-makes-startling-claim-regarding-on-field-concussion-surveillance/">Player Welfare is World Rugby’s number one priority</a>. Therefore we have developed a trial process to enable the assessment of headgear devices which, according to the manufacturers, have been designed to achieve specific, quantifiable medical purposes.</p>
      <p>“In order to maximise player safety, we have set the entry criteria for this trial at a very high standard to achieve specific, quantifiable medical advances, while aligning with Law 4 and Regulation 12 criteria.</p>
      <p>“Independent consultants will be examining the research and development data generated by N-Pro during the trial to understand effectiveness.”</p>
