      <h1>Property developer takes Victorian Planning Minister to Supreme Court</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Simon Johanson</a></address>
      <p>A property developer is taking Victoria's Planning Minister to the Supreme Court after the minister approved a planning amendment which resulted in the levies imposed on the developer's Footscray apartment project jumping from $400,000 to $3 million.</p>
      <p>Bensons Property Group has filed a writ against Victorian Minister for Planning Richard Wynne in a bid to have a C145 amendment to the Maribyrnong planning scheme set aside on the grounds it was “invalid” and the minister was acting beyond his powers.</p>
      <p>Local government planning schemes are usually amended after a process of community consultation followed by a formal vote at the council level and then a final approval or rejection from the planning minister.</p>

      <p>Contesting a planning amendment in court is an unusual move, although developers have been quick to take legal action over the imposition of new levies in the past.</p>

      <p>Mr Wynne approved the Maribyrnong planning amendment in September this year after the council adopted it in July.</p>
      <p>“The decision of the Minister to approve Amendment C145 ... was beyond power and of no legal effect,” Bensons’ writ states.</p>
      <p>The property group, run by <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-gdu19j.html">developer Elias Jreissati</a>, is in the initial stages of developing two apartment projects in Footscray’s Joseph Road precinct, an inner-west parcel bordered by Hopkins Street, the Maribyrnong river and Williamstown railway line.</p>
      <p>At least seven apartment projects with 3734 dwellings have gained planning approval in the former industrial precinct, including Bensons.</p>
      <p>Court documents filed by Mr Jreissati’s company show one of its projects, a tower with 198 units in Moreland Street, was required to pay a development levy of $140,000 when it was first given approval in 2011.</p>
      <p>The levy on another neighbouring Benson project, a 350-dwelling tower in Warde Street, was $269,850 when it was granted approval in 2016.</p>

      <p>The developer applied to get both its permits amended in April this year, but the council failed to approve them and instead went ahead with the C145 amendment for the Joseph Road precinct which significantly upped the developer’s levy.</p>
      <p>The higher development contributions apply to all permits, including those already approved.</p>
      <p>As a result of the new levy under the C145 change, Bensons will be required to pay $2,908,493 in contributions for both projects, court documents claim.</p>
      <p>Neither the minister nor Bensons would comment because the matter was in court.</p>
      <p>S.T.L planning lawyer Tom Bacon said if Bensons is successful, it might pave the way for other developers to also be exempt from the new levy.</p>
      <p>“This would be bad news for the council which is dependent on that revenue to fund its infrastructure and projects,” Mr Bacon said.</p>
