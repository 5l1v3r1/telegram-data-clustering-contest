      <h1>Deflation hits Australia’s residential land markets</h1>

      <p>Late last month, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) released its 2018-19 Australian System of National Accounts (ASNA) release, which provided a detailed presentation of annual national accounts data.</p>
      <p>Locked away on Table 61 was my favourite section of the release: data on aggregate land values at the state and national levels. This year’s release <a href="https://www.macrobusiness.com.au/2019/10/sydney-melbourne-land-values-bust/">confirmed</a> that, at a national level, the land values underpinning the Australian house prices fell heavily when measured against GDP.</p>
      <p>The release on Friday of the annual state accounts by the ABS has enabled me to calculate residential land values as a percentage of gross state product (GSP), which provides a measure of over/under valuation.</p>
