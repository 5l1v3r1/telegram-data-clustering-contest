      <h1>Updated: Satmar Rebbe Arrives in Israel for 10-Day Visit</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:50:38+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:50</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.jewishpress.com/author/hlj/" target="_blank">Hana Levi Julian</a></address>
      <p>The Grand Rabbi (Rebbe) of Satmar in Williamsburg, Rabbi Zalmen Teitelbaum, arrived Tuesday morning for a 10-day visit to the Holy Land, during which he is expected to distribute huge amounts of cash to his followers and institutions, which do not accept any funds from the State of Israel.</p>
      <p>Satmar Hassidim believe the Zionist movement is an attempt to force God into prematurely sending Moshiach (the Messiah) into the world, and therefore fiercely oppose the establishment of the state and all of its associated institutions, including any funding.</p>
      <p>The Rebbe is also scheduled to meet with other strictly Orthodox leaders as well during his stay, and is expected to travel to Mount Scopus in order to view the Western Wall and the Temple Mount, but will not visit either site.</p>
      <p>Beginning Tuesday at 4 pm, the following streets will be blocked in both directions:<br/>Malchei Yisrael and Sarei Israel<br/>Shamgar / Sarei Israel junction<br/>Rehov Yafo / Sarei Israel junction</p>
      <p>No vehicle will be allowed to reach any of the nearby streets or those leading in to these areas.</p>
      <p>Drivers will be redirected to main arteries such as Yirmiyahu and Shamgar, police said.</p>
      <p>Only public transportation will be allowed to access the Begin Highway and Rabin Boulevard.</p>
      <p>“Due to the anticipated heavy traffic, we recommend that the public plan and advance their travel accordingly, and use a GPS navigational app,” police said. “We urge the public to heed police instructions and above all, be patient.”</p>
