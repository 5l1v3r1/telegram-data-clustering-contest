      <h1>Julian Assange rape investigation dropped by Sweden</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:14:54+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:14</time> by <a rel="author">Travis Fedschun</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/sweden">Sweden</a> dropped a preliminary investigation Tuesday into an <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/crime">alleged rape</a> by WikiLeaks founder <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/julian-assange">Julian Assange</a>.</p>
      <p>Deputy Chief Prosecutor Eva-Marie Persson made the announcement as she gave an update on the <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/europe">Swedish</a> case, saying the rape investigation has been discontinued  because "the evidence has weakened considerably due to the long period of time that has elapsed since the events in question."</p>
      <p>Persson said the alleged victim, who accused Assange of raping her in 2010, "submitted a credible and reliable version of events."</p>
      <p>"Her statements have been coherent, extensive and detailed," Persson said.</p>
      <p>Assange, 48, who spent seven years in Ecuador's embassy in <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/united-kingdom">London</a> before he was dragged out in April, is still wanted in the U.S. to face 18 counts, including conspiring to hack government computers and violating an espionage law.</p>

      <p>In June, a Swedish court ruled that Assange should not be detained, meaning that while a preliminary investigation in Sweden shouldn't be abandoned, he wouldn't be extradited and could be questioned in Britain.</p>

      <p>Two months earlier, Assange was evicted from the Ecuador Embassy in London where he had been holed up since 2012. He was immediately arrested and is currently serving a 50-week sentence in Britain for jumping bail in 2012.</p>
      <p>Assange is also fighting extradition to the United States, which accuses him of publishing secret documents. Last month, Assange lost a bid in a U.K. court to delay proceedings as he fights extradition on espionage charges.</p>
      <p>In response to the Swedish announcement, Kristinn Hrafnsson, WikiLeaks editor-in-chief, said: “Let us now focus on the threat Mr. Assange has been warning about for years: the belligerent prosecution of the United States and the threat it poses to the First Amendment."</p>

      <p>The full hearing to decide his extradition is still set for a five-day period in late February, with brief interim hearings in November and December.</p>

      <p>U.S. authorities accuse Assange of scheming with former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to crack a password that provided access to classified material on a government computer.</p>

      <p>Assange's lawyer, Mark Summers, <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/wikileaks-julian-assange-appears-in-court">told a judge last month</a> that more time was needed to prepare his client's defense because the case has many facets -- including the very rare use of espionage charges against a journalist, as Assange defines himself -- and requires a "mammoth" amount of planning and preparation.</p>
      <p>"Our case will be that this is a political attempt to signal to journalists the consequences of publishing information," he said. "It is legally unprecedented."</p>
