      <p>Sara was present for a chat with Barkha Dutt where she spoke about body positivity, feminism and the gradual change in the film industry. What bought hate was her remark on colourism. She said, “If you wanna be tan, just put on some bronzer, and if you wanna be fair, put on some powder. It’s not the end of the world, and it shouldn’t define you at all. There is a higher probability and success rate for you to attempt to change yourself, than the world, because they are not going to change.”</p>
      <p>The statement triggered Twitterati and they pointed out at Sara using her privilege to sabotage a huge issue that is between us. A user wrote, “People with privileges may definitely find it difficult to relate to the current biases towards others. It’s only excruciating and disappointing #SaraAliKhan.”</p>
