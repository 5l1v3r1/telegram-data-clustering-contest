      <p>The Green Party has revealed the details of its General Election manifesto.</p>
      <p>Titled If Not Now, When?’, the left-wing party has announced 10 new laws that would be ready to be implemented if co-leaders Sian Berry and Jonathan Bartley won an against-the-odds majority on December 12.</p>

      <p>Here is an at-a-glance look at what is in the 89-page manifesto.</p>
      <p>
        <b>– Environment</b>
      </p>
      <p>The manifesto pledges an, already announced, £100 million per year investment plan to deliver a Green New Deal over the next 10 years.</p>
      <p>It would look to totally overhaul the use of fossil fuels by switching transport and industry to renewable energy sources, while upgrading household heating systems and planting 700 million trees within a decade.</p>
      <p>The party wants to use the measures to create a net-zero carbon economy by 2030.</p>

      <p>
        <b>– Brexit</b>
      </p>
      <p>The pro-European Union party has re-committed itself to a second referendum and to campaign for Remain.</p>
      <p>It says staying in the bloc would help “lead the fight against the climate emergency”.</p>
      <p>
        <b>– Crime</b>
      </p>
      <p>Restorative justice would be expanded to allow those affected by crimes to meet offenders as part of a bid to cut the prison population by 50%.</p>
      <p>Misogyny would be made a hate crime under a Green-led administration and the personal use of drugs, including some Class A substances, would be de-criminalised.</p>
      <p>Heroin would be available on prescription and cannabis clubs would be permitted, allowing marijuana to be grown and consumed by adults.</p>
      <p>
        <b>– Welfare</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Greens would introduce a universal basic income, providing every UK citizen with £89 per week in state funding.</p>
      <p>It would provide a boost to those in work and leave no-one on benefits worse off, according to the manifesto.</p>

      <p>
        <b>– Health</b>
      </p>
      <p>Party leaders have promised to increase funding for the NHS by at least £6 billion each year until 2030 – a 4.5% increase on the 2018/19 budget.</p>
      <p>Privatisation in the NHS would also be abolished, while mental health care would be put on an “equal footing” with physical care.</p>
      <p>
        <b>– Education</b>
      </p>
      <p>The party pledges to boost education funding by at least £4 billion per year and to lay down a long-term aim of reducing classes to 20 pupils and below.</p>
      <p>Ofsted would be replaced with a “collaborative system of assessing” schools and a new law would put onus on teaching children about climate change.</p>
      <p>In higher education, tuition fees would be scrapped and those who paid £9,000 a year to study would have their debt wiped.</p>
