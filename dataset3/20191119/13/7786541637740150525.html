      <p><b>MILANÂ (AP)</b> - Prosecutors in Sicily are investigating former Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini for not allowing a humanitarian rescue ship to enter Italian waters this summer.</p>
      <p>The news agency ANSA said Salvini was being investigated for abduction and dereliction of duty for the 20-day stand-off with a ship carrying 164 migrants operated by Spanish group Proactive Open Arms.</p>
      <p>Salvini, the leader of the right-wing League, has avoided trial for similar instances in the past when he was minister, because parliament refused to lift his immunity.</p>
      <p>He lost his ministerial role in August when his failed attempt at a power grab toppled the government.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors have two weeks to decide whether to proceed with the case.</p>
      <p>Salvini was dismissive of the investigation, calling it a waste of taxpayer money and judicial officials' time.</p>
