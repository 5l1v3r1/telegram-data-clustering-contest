      <h1>MEP quits Brexit Party over election candidate’s homophobic comments</h1>
      <h2>Scottish MEP says his ‘personal values’ are ‘now in direct conflict with those of the party.’</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:15:24+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:15</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Dallison</a></address>
      <p>A member of the European Parliament said he was leaving the Brexit Party over its decision to put forward for election a candidate “who has openly posted homophobic views across social media.”</p>
      <p>Louis Stedman-Bryce <a href="https://twitter.com/Lstedmanbryce/status/1196753546127069184?s=20">said on Twitter</a> Tuesday that the party’s decision “is not only a betrayal of the LGBT community but also a betrayal of everyone who believes that such divisive and hateful views have no place in our society.”</p>
      <p>That appeared to be a reference to Victor Robert Farrell, who was the Brexit Party's candidate in Glenrothes in the east of Scotland. Earlier this week, the member of the Scottish parliament for the region, Jennie Gilruth, posted what she said were <a href="https://twitter.com/JennyGilruth/status/1196350318994501632?s=20">screenshots</a> from Farrell's social media accounts, dating from 2017, in which he declared with reference to the LGBTQ community "WAR WITH YOU ALL" and called for the "Christ-rejecting swamps" to be drained and "the creatures therein ... making into shoes and handbags and buried with Hugh Heffner [sic]."</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the Brexit Party said Monday it "does not share these views. We have withdrawn our support for the candidate,” according to <a href="https://www.kingdomfm.co.uk/news/local-news/fife-brexit-party-candidate-dropped-by-party/">Kingdom FM radio</a>.</p>
      <p>Stedman-Bryce said his "personal values" were "now in direct conflict with those of the party," adding that he "cannot and will not compromise."</p>

      <p>He also accused the party of failing to deliver on its promises but said he remains "committed to Brexit" and "I will fight on, unhindered, as an independent MEP" for Scotland.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month, Stedman-Bryce stood down as a candidate in the December 12 general election because of <a href="https://www.politico.eu/pro/why-nigel-farages-brexit-party-uk-british-election-gift-isnt-a-game-changer-boris-johnson-tory-party/">Nigel Farage's decision</a> not to contest more than 300 seats held by the Conservatives for fear of splitting the pro-Brexit vote.</p>
      <p>Stedman-Bryce had been due to stand in Glasgow North East, which is a Labour seat. But he withdrew from the race, <a href="https://twitter.com/Lstedmanbryce/status/1194263566016233474?s=20">saying on Twitter</a>: “I joined the Brexit Party to change politics for good and uphold democracy and I do not trust Boris Johnson to deliver the type of Brexit I voted for. I believe that the deal he has proposed would be devastating to our country and our future prosperity.</p>
      <p>“So it is with a heavy heart that I have taken the decision not to run in the upcoming general election.”</p>
