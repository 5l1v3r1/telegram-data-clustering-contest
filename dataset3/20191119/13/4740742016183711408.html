      <h2>The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse is gearing up for the next stage of its investigation</h2>

      <p>Clifton College will be examined in a major inquiry into child sexual abuse, it has been announced.</p>
      <p>Evidence regarding child sexual abuse allegations at the fee-paying school are set to be heard at a public hearing in May 2020.</p>
      <p>The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse has urged anyone with first-hand knowledge of allegations of abuse at the school to get in touch.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/clifton">Clifton </a>College is one of three schools (two of them in the Bristol area) which will be put under the microscope as part of the second phase of the investigation into residential schools.</p>
      <p>In a statement released today (November 19), the inquiry wrote it “will take a broader look at safeguarding procedures within the schools sector in general, including day schools”.</p>
      <p>The statement added: “This will include an examination of culture, governance and management when allegations of child sexual abuse are made, while also hearing from teaching unions and the Teaching Regulation Agency.”</p>
      <p>In 2015, former Clifton teacher Jonathan Thomson-Glover was jailed after pleading guilty to 36 counts of taking, making and possessing indecent images of children.</p>
      <p>Allegations of abuse at Hillside First School in Worle, North Somerset, will also be considered in the public hearing.</p>
      <p>In 2011, Hillside teacher <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/pervert-teacher-who-filmed-himself-1980816">Nigel Leat</a>, of Bristol, was jailed indefinitely after admitting dozens of offences against children.</p>
      <p>Hillside First School has since been renamed Worle Village Primary School.</p>
      <p>The third school set to feature in the public hearing, due to take place in London from May 11-22, is Headlands School in East Yorkshire.</p>
      <p>In a statement, the inquiry wrote: “Anybody who has first hand knowledge of allegations of child sexual abuse at Clifton College, Headlands School [in Yorkshire] or Hillside First School can email the Inquiry on solicitors@iicsa.org.uk with Residential Schools investigation in the subject line, or telephone the Inquiry information line on 0800 917 1000.”</p>
      <p>A school spokesperson said: “Clifton College has been called to provide evidence to Phase Two of the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA).</p>
      <p>"The school’s participation relates to the conviction in 2015 of former housemaster, Jonathan Thomson-Glover, after which the school commissioned an independent and thorough investigation into its child protection processes.</p>
      <p>"This report was published in August 2016 and led to extensive changes in our safeguarding policies, procedures and practices.</p>
      <p>"A total commitment to safeguarding is at the very heart of the College and we hope that our assistance to the Inquiry will help to strengthen safeguarding across the sector.” </p>
