      <p>SAN FRANCISCO, Nov 19 — Google sets out to transform the video game world with its Stadia service crafted to let people access console-quality games as easily as they do email.</p>
      <p>With the Stadia launch today, the internet giant is aiming for a piece of a global video game industry expected to top US$150 billion (RM624 billion) this year by using its cloud computing technology offering rich features without the need for consoles.</p>
      <p>Stadia announced 10 more games yesterday to bring its lineup to 22 with more promised by year’s end.</p>
      <p>Google last month sold out of <i>Founder’s Edition</i> kits, which are priced at US$129. Some who ordered Stadia kits were grumbling online that they had yet to receive the hardware they need to use the service.</p>
      <p>Each kit contains a Stadia controller and a pendant-shaped Chromecast Ultra wireless connection device that plugs into television sets.</p>
      <p>Stadia games are also playable using Google Chrome web browser software on computers as well as with Google-made Pixel smartphones from the second-generation onward.</p>
      <p>Stadia Pro subscriptions, priced at US$10 a month in the US, will be available in 14 countries in North America and Europe.</p>
      <p>Subscribers will be able to buy games that will be hosted at Google data centres, but some free games will be available to them, starting with <i>Destiny 2: The Collection</i>.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Game on</b>
      </p>
      <p>Stadia on smartphones at the start will work with wifi connections rather than rely on mobile telecom services.</p>
      <p>Being able to play without lags or interruptions is paramount to gamers, and flawed internet connections could cause frustration. Internet speed will also determine how rich in-game graphics can be.</p>
      <p>Some promised features such as integration with YouTube will not be in place at launch.</p>
      <p>Google appeared to be committed to making Stadia a success, according to Ubisoft senior vice president of partnerships Chris Early.</p>
      <p>The French video game giant has been working with Google and its games are among titles coming to the service.</p>
      <p>“From what I have seen, their plans are too deep; they are too good, and they are too invested,” Early said. “They are not calling it quits any time soon.”</p>
      <p>He expects a long launch period during which Google will beef up Stadia.</p>
      <p>“If there is a one-day problem at launch, it isn’t the end of the world,” he said, stressing the potential for Stadia to let people play without investing in consoles.</p>
      <p>Stadia aims to lead the way to hosting titles in data centres, letting people use whatever gadgets they wish to access console-quality play.</p>
      <p>US technology veteran Microsoft has been testing a Project xCloud online game platform that it plans to make available on Windows-powered personal computers next year.</p>
      <p>Sony Interactive Entertainment has a PlayStation Now service that combines cloud gaming and title downloads that is synched to its latest-generation consoles and Windows-powered personal computers.</p>
      <p>Having titles sit on powerful servers in the cloud could allow for unprecedented features such as thousands of people playing simultaneously or environments as detailed as the real world.</p>
      <p>The Google move comes following the launch of the Apple Arcade mobile game service, which offers custom game apps downloaded to devices. A rival Google Play Pass charges the same US$4.99 monthly subscription price as that of Arcade, which focuses on games for Apple iOS devices. — AFP</p>
