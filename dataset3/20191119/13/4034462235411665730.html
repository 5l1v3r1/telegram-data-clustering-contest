      <h1>Exquisite 2019 Jaguar XJ Collection Marks End Of An Era</h1>
      <h2>Jaguarâ€™s flagship luxury sedan is bowing out with style.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:16:36+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:16</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Bigg</a></address>
      <p>This year marks the end of an era for Jaguar because the iconic <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/jaguar/xj">Jaguar XJ</a> luxury sedan is ending production after over 50 years. Replacing it will be a <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/all-electric-jaguar-xj-could-produce-over-800-horsepower">new flagship electric sedan</a>, but before then Jaguar is giving the combustion-powered model a special send-off.</p>
      <p>Joining the 2019 XJ lineup is the limited-edition XJ Collection Special Edition model designed to celebrate the current-generation XJ's legacy. Production will be limited to just 300 units representing the final examples of the current XJ that will roll off the production line and will be sold exclusively to US customers.</p>

      <p>Based on the long-wheelbase, rear-wheel drive Jaguar XJL Supercharged model, the XJ Collection is distinguished by a range of exterior enhancements and unique cabin details. Inside, the XJ Collection features door panels with a gloss rich oak veneer and a linear laser inlay not found in any other XJ model, as well as a wood and leather steering wheel and unique metal treadplates with 'XJ Collection' branding. Each model will also receive an 'XJ Collection One of 300' plaque on the leather-wrapped dashboard.</p>
      <p>Exterior highlights include 20-inch 5 split-spoke style wheels with a satin grey finish from the short wheelbase XJ Supercharged model and a 'Collection' badge on the decklid. A choice of exterior and interior color combinations will include a Yulong White or Santorini Black exterior paired with Ebony/Ebonyor Mineral/Ivory interiors as well as a British Racing Green exterior matched with an Ebony/London Tan interior.</p>

      <p>"The Jaguar XJ has always represented the pinnacle of Jaguar's model line-up," said Julian Thomson, Jaguar Design Director. "With its skillful blend of beautiful design, engaging performance and revered luxury, it has always proved a class apart, rewarding its driver just as much as it cossets and comforts the passenger. The limited-edition XJ Collection is the ultimate expression of refinement and timeless luxury."</p>
