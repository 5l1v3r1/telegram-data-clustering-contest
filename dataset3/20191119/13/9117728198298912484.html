        <b>After coming as close as ever to opening his points-scoring account in Formula 1, <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/williams">Williams</a> rookie <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/george-russell">George Russell</a> thinks it simply <i>"wasn't meant to be"</i> in Brazil as he remains the only driver to not score any points in the 2019 season.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Russell, who came into F1 as the reigning Formula 2 champion, winning seven races in the 2018 campaign, has had a very frustrating campaign so far for Williams. The Grove-based side have simply been too far off the pace, despite the 21-year-old's best efforts.</p>
      <p>Teammate <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/robert-kubica">Robert Kubica</a> has scored the team's only point so far this season in Germany, when both Alfas were disqualified post-race, bumping the Pole up to P10. It doesn't represent the rest of the season, however, as Russell has almost always been the driver setting the pace for Williams.</p>

      <p>Although he's been 11th before (in Germany as well), Russell was within touching distance of scoring points in Brazil after the late Safety Car drama, finishing 1.6 seconds behind 10th-placed <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/daniil-kvyat">Daniil Kvyat</a>.</p>
      <p><i>“It was quite a long lonely race to start with and then suddenly it was all kicking off in front,” </i>Russell told <a href="https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article.it-wasnt-meant-to-be-russell-on-missing-maiden-point-by-1-6s.6H2tGBFFgKV82JkqxbiFFX.html"><i>Formula1.com</i></a>.</p>
      <p>
        <i>"I gave it my everything to try and get an overtake here and there and try and salvage everything we could but it wasn’t meant to be and that was the maximum we could do.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>Although progress has been made since the start of the season, Williams are still a long way behind other midfield contenders.</p>
