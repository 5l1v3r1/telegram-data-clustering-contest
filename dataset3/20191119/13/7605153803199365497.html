        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 19 – Vitafoam Products Limited, a leading manufacturer of innovative foam based products has partnered with Lipa Later to offer a point of sale credit option that allows purchasers to buy merchandise in affordable monthly installments.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>This gives consumers fast access to reliable credit.</b>
      </p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>Sharad Barot the Chief Operations Officer of Vitafoam Products Limited said, “As a result of this partnership, there is instant approval for both salaried and unsalaried customers with credit worthiness.”</p>
      <p>“This saves our customers from missing to buy items they want due to limited available funds. It reduces the time that would otherwise be needed to accumulate funds over several months before buying and maintains our cash flow.”</p>
      <p>Eric Muli, the CEO of Lipa Later, “Through providing easily accessible payment plans, we are working on delivering our promise to help our customers achieve affordable living.”</p>
      <p>Vitafoam Products Limited specializes in manufacturing flexible polyurethane foam products. These include mattresses, foam sheets, cushions, carpet underlay, bolsters and pillows of different densities and sizes.</p>
      <p>Most of our mattresses carry a warranty of seven years. The organisation has showrooms on Mombasa Road, Muthithi Road in Westlands and at the Two Rivers complex.</p>
      <p>Launched in 2016, Lipa Later provides a payment option that allows consumers unlimited access to products and services as they pay for them over time. It is designed to meet customer needs through the use of technology and innovation and its wide partnership network in East Africa.</p>
