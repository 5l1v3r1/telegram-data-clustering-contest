      <h1>Joyce promises to 'focus on cost' in Qantas profit drive</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Patrick Hatch</a></address>
      <p>Qantas says fresh cost-cutting, new aircraft and revenue-raising initiatives such as giving individual customers "personalised" airfare offers will deliver it ambitious earnings improvements in its core airline business over the next five years.</p>
      <p>The plan that Qantas laid out to improve the profit margin in its domestic operation from 12 per cent to 18 per cent, and raise Jetstar's from 9 per cent to 22 per cent by 2024, saw its shares jump 2.15 per cent on Tuesday to close at an all-time high of $7.10.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.theage.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p52jho.html">Qantas last month signalled slowing global and domestic economies</a> were weighing on passenger numbers, and both it and its domestic competitor Virgin Australia had been keeping a tight rein on capacity amid slowing demand.</p>
      <p>“In the year ahead there will be a lot more focus on cost and in the next five years we think there is a path to achieve significant improvement in margins,” Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said at an investor day in Sydney.</p>
      <p>“We look around the world and we see that full-service airlines are getting to margins in the high-teens so we’ll continue to target that for Qantas domestic."</p>
      <blockquote>In the next five years we think there is a path to achieve significant improvement in margins.<cite>Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce</cite></blockquote>
      <p>Qantas domestic chief executive Andrew David said costs would come down from digital integration; better scheduling so that each of its planes spent more time in the air; fuel efficiency from flight planning tools, and changes to its engineering strategy.</p>
      <p>He also said targeting individual customers with offers and prices based on when and where an artificial intelligence program decides they may want to fly next would help improve revenue.</p>
      <p>Jetstar will, meanwhile, continue to drive "ancillary revenue" higher, Mr David said. About 17 per cent of Jetstar's revenue comes from the extras that customers pay for on top of their ticket, such as baggage allowances, food and other add-ons, and this is growing at about 8 per cent a year.</p>
      <p>The budget carrier will also be boosted by the introduction of the Airbus A321LRs to its fleet from next year, which are 23 per cent more fuel-efficient and carry 25 per cent more seats than the A320s they replace, and will also free up Jetstar's 787s to push further into Asian destinations such as South Korea and Japan.</p>

      <p>Mr Joyce said there was short-term volatility in Asia, with slower activity due to the US-China trade war. However, he said the region remained a long-term growth opportunity for the Qantas group, particularly through Jetstar and the subsidiary it has in Japan.</p>
      <p>"We are still seeing very significant growth in this region, [just] not as big as we were expecting a few years ago," Mr Joyce said.</p>
      <p>Qantas International has historically delivered the group's biggest losses but Mr Joyce said that part of the business had been "fundamentally transformed" and would continue to improve as the last of its fuel-guzzling Boeing 747s are replaced with 787s, and as it leveraged its newly formed partnership with American Airlines.</p>
