      <p>The DuckDuckGo Smarter Encryption feature will automatically give you the encrypted HTTPS version of websites as they are available.</p>
      <blockquote>It’s available on DuckDuckGo’s mobile browser for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duckduckgo.mobile.android&amp;hl=en_US">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/duckduckgo-privacy-browser/id663592361">iOS</a>, and through the company’s desktop browser extension for Firefox and Chrome. DuckDuckGo is also open sourcing the code behind the feature so other sites and platforms can adopt it as well. First up? Pinterest.</blockquote>
      <p>I especially like how they’re open-sourcing it for others to use.</p>
