      <p>If you read our <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/reviews/phone/oppo-reno-10x-review/"><b>review</b></a> of the <a href="https://www.talkandroid.com/339052-oppos-reno-10x-zoom-edition-ditches-the-notch-in-favor-of-a-wedge/">Reno 10x Zoom Edition</a>, you’ll know that we were mightily impressed with OPPO’s 2019 flagship smartphone. Combining impressive camera chops, flagship hardware, incredible battery life, and a snazzy design, the Reno 10x signifies OPPO’s rise from a niche import in the UK to a mainstream competitor. And, with Black Friday looming on the horizon, you can now save £190 off the RRP of the Reno 10x Zoom Edition because OPPO has reduced its price down to just £459, which is insane. Besides the Reno 10x Zoom Edition, OPPO has discounted a bunch of other handsets, and we’ve got the details for you below.</p>
      <p>OPPO’s Black Friday deals are set to run until December 2 and are available from Amazon and Carphone Warehouse.</p>
