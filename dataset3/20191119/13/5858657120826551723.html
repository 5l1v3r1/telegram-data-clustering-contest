      <p>OAKLAND, Calif. — A child, not the grizzly bears, cracked a glass viewing window at the Oakland Zoo’s bear exhibit, and officials say there’s no need to fear the bears will get out.</p>
      <p>Oakland Zoo spokeswoman Erin Harrison said in a statement Tuesday that a child hit a rock against the glass several times, “shattering the laminate layer.”</p>
      <p>She says the bulletproof-strength glass at the enclosure where four grizzly bears live is made of six separate panes, each an inch (2.5 centimetres) thick.</p>
      <p>She says another zoo visitor reported the child to staff, but they couldn’t find the family.</p>
      <p>Harrison says a replacement glass plane will cost $67,000 and require specialty equipment to install next month.</p>
