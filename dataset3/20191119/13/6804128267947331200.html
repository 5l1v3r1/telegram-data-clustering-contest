      <h1>'Shameful!' West Ham owner David Gold slams Man United great Roy Keane for Declan Rice comments</h1>
      <h2>West Ham owner David Gold has addressed Roy Keane's strong criticism of Declan Rice</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:16:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:16</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Clarke</a></address>
      <p>West Ham owner David Gold has issued a strong defence of star player <a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/declan-rice">Declan Rice</a> after some harsh criticism from Manchester United great Roy Keane.</p>
      <p>The playmaker was recalled by Gareth Southgate to the England team for their final Group A clash in Kosovo after missing the victory over Montenegro which secured the Three Lions' qualification for the Euro 2020 tournament.</p>
      <p>The 20-year-old hadn't started for England since their shock 2-1 defeat to the Czech Republic last month, but was brought in for the 4-0 win over Kosovo.</p>
      <p>Rice has been reported as a long-term target for United as Ole Gunnar Solskjaer looks to reshape his midfield and MEN sport have reported that the Red Devils are interested in signing the player.</p>
      <p>However, Keane was quick to criticise Rice when asked what he must improve to become an England regular.</p>
      <p>"Where does he need to improve, where do you want me to start? His positional play, I don't think is consistent enough, he doesn't stay with runners, he's sloppy in possession," Keane told ITV Sport.</p>
      <p>"I can go on. He's one of those players, a couple of months ago everyone was enjoying him and loved him. He's one of those players that's now played his way out of the team because he's not been consistent for West Ham."</p>
      <p>However, <a href="https://www.football.london/west-ham-united-fc/">West Ham</a> owner Gold has since countered those comments with thoughts of his own on the talented midfielder.</p>
      <p>"Keane needs to get over it. Declan made his choice and I think that is what’s behind it as far as Keane is concerned," Gold told <a href="https://www.claretandhugh.info/gold-slams-arrogant-and-unfair-keane/">West Ham fan side Claret and Hugh</a>.</p>
      <p>"It’s pretty shameful when a former professional talks the way he did about a young man. It was low, outrageous, unfair and arrogant to pick him out of all the England players.</p>
      <p>"It wasn’t even an analysis of the boy who is 20 years old who has barely started his career in the international team for God’s sake.</p>

      <p>"This isn’t the first time he’s done it. In a previous game he said he should be sitting in the studio with the pundits rather than being on the pitch. Shocking! Declan has chosen to play for England and Roy Keane needs to get over that."</p>
