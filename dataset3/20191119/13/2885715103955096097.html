      <p><b>India vs Oman Football Live Score, FIFA World Cup 2022 Qualifiers Live Streaming:</b> Winless in four games so far, the Indian football team faces higher-ranked Oman in a do-or-die World Cup qualifying round match on Tuesday. A first half strike from Sunil Chhetri gave India hopes of beating Oman in the first leg in Guwahati in September but the men in blue went down in the final 10 minutes. Oman are coming into this match after an emphatic (4-1) win over Bangladesh on November 14. India, on the other hand, are struggling after an impressive goal-less draw against Asian champions Qatar as they needed late equalisers in their identical 1-1 draws against lower-ranked Bangladesh and Afghanistan.</p>
