      <p>Indian authorities have arrested 32 people for being involved in the use of call centres scamming Canadians for money.</p>
      <p>Deputy police commissioner Sameer Sharma said that the call centres were specifically targetting Canadian citizens and the department was made aware of the situation on November 15th.</p>
      <p>On November 17th, the police arrested the individuals and also seized 55 computers and 35 phones, <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/32-arrested-at-indian-call-centre-that-targeted-canadians-1.4690651"><i>CTV News </i></a>reported.</p>
      <p>Sharma said that the police found several scam calls in progress that showed computer screens with Canadian phone numbers. Three supervisors of the call centre were also present.</p>
      <p>“The supervisors…were asked about the activity going on there but they could not give any satisfactory answer,” Sharma said in a recent statement.</p>
      <p>“On sustained questioning, they divulged that they were engaged in calling [Canadians] and impersonating [themselves] as genuine Canadian police.”</p>
      <p>Scam calls have risen in the country over the past several months. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2018/12/19/crtc-telecoms-block-customer-spam-calls-by-dec-2019/">has given a deadline for</a> big telecom carriers to have better technology to detect and block nefarious calls.</p>
      <p>Until this technology is introduced, there really is no way of knowing if a call is a scam or not. <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/11/15/how-to-identify-block-spamc-calls-ios-android/"><i>MobileSyrup</i> recently wrote</a> how you can deal with scam calls and the best way to block them.</p>
      <p>The individuals arrested in India were in breach of the Indian Telegraph Act, Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act and Information Technology Act, <i>CTV</i> reported.</p>
      <p>The police added that the calls were made using Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), a process in which a scammer can make calls over the internet. The scammer can use a website to generate a number that looks like a genuine number to call someone else.</p>
      <p>According to CTV, the authorities are aware that one Canadian was duped out of $13,500 CAD.</p>
