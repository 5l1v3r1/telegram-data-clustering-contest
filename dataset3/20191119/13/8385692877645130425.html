      <p><a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/oneplus">OnePlus</a> has started <a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/oxygenos-10-0-2-for-the-oneplus-7-pro-and-oneplus-7.1142262/">pushing out</a> a new update for the OnePlus 7 and 7 Pro. This update is marked as OxygenOS 10.0.2, and it brings quite a few optimizations for the OnePlus 7 series.</p>
      <p>The changelog is almost the same for both devices. The OnePlus 7 Pro has one more change compared to the OnePlus 7, and that change is camera-related. Let's get that out of the way first, shall we.</p>
      <p>OxygenOS 10.0.2 optimizes the performance of the 'Super Stable' feature in the Video for the Camera app on the OnePlus 7 Pro. That is the only difference when it comes to the OnePlus 7 and 7 Pro changelogs.</p>

      <h3>OxygenOS 10.0.2 for the OnePlus 7 series is all about optimizations and fixes</h3>
      <p>With this update, OnePlus optimizes the standby power consumption on both OnePlus 7 devices. This update will also optimize the expanded screenshot feature that had slight issues in some scenarios</p>
      <p>Bluetooth connectivity in automobiles has also been optimized, and the same goes for overall communication (network, phone calls, mobile data) performance.</p>
      <p>With OxygenOS 10.0.2, OnePlus also improved the translation accuracy on the OnePlus 7 series. Charging performance with third-party chargers has been optimized as well.</p>

      <p>Now, on top of these optimizations, OnePlus also introduced some straight-up fixes. The black screen issue has been fixed, as has the fingerprint icon animation issue.</p>
      <p>These two issues have been popping up for users from time to time. Even though they are a bit annoying when they happen, those were not major problems at all, and didn't happen that often. That was the case with our OnePlus 7 Pro unit, at least.</p>
      <p>The volume issue with AirPods has been fixed as well, and the same goes for the black bar issue while charging or playing a video. System stability has been improved overall, and various small bug fixes have been issued as well.</p>

      <h3>Android security patch for October 2019 is also included</h3>
      <p>OxygenOS 10.0.2 also brings an Android security patch for October on both OnePlus 7 series devices.</p>
      <p>This update will roll out gradually. It will first roll out to a limited number of devices, after which the intensity will increase. If everything goes according to plan, all OnePlus 7 and 7 Pro users will have the update in the next week or two.</p>
      <p>OnePlus may decide to stop rolling out this update if it notices major bugs. It has happened in the past, and the latest example is the OnePlus 6 and 6T Android 10 update. Your OnePlus 7 (Pro) handset will let you know when the update is available, though you can also manually check via the Settings app.</p>
