      <h1>Ant may join race for Singapore virtual bank licenses</h1>

      <p>SINGAPORE/HONG KONG (Nov 19): Billionaire Jack Ma’s Ant Financial Services Group said it may apply for a virtual banking license in Singapore, a move that would add a heavyweight contender to the race.</p>
      <p>“We are actively looking into this opportunity,“ Hangzhou, China-based Ant Financial said in an emailed response to questions from <i>Bloomberg News.</i></p>
      <p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore is offering as many as five digital banking permits to non-banks in a bid to open up the industry to new competitors. A successful entry by Ant Financial would pit China’s largest online financial company against traditional incumbents DBS Group Holdings Ltd. and Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp in the growing market for digital banking in Southeast Asia.</p>
      <p>While Ant didn’t disclose whether it will seek a retail or wholesale license, it will be easier for the Chinese firm to meet the conditions for the latter.</p>
      <p>Singapore’s efforts to open up the banking industry to technology companies comes on the heels of a similar move in Hong Kong, where Ant and Chinese competitors including Tencent Holdings Ltd obtained licenses earlier this year.</p>
      <p>“The recent licensing of several China ‘Big Tech’ banks in Hong Kong represents the formal entry of such players into the international financial system,” said James Lloyd, the Asia-Pacific financial-technology lead for consulting firm EY. “It seems probable that Singapore will follow in this regard,” he said, while pointing out that foreign applicants have more room to maneuver with a digital wholesale bank rather than a full-services one.</p>
      <p>There are up to two licenses on offer for full digital banks, which can serve all kinds of customers and require S$1.5 billion (US$1.1 billion) in capital, as well as local control. Another three would be for wholesale banks, which foreign firms can run and have a capital threshold of S$100 million.</p>
      <p>OCBC, Southeast Asia’s second-largest lender, has agreed to join peer-to-peer lender Validus Capital Pte. and Temasek Holdings Pte’s venture capital arm to seek a wholesale license before the year-end application deadline. DBS, which operates a digital bank in India and Indonesia, hasn’t expressed any intention to seek a license.</p>
      <p>Southeast Asia’s digital lending market is expected to more than quadruple to US$110 billion by 2025, according to a report by Bain &amp; Co, Google and Temasek Holdings Pte.</p>
      <p>Ant SME Services (Hong Kong) Ltd unit received a permit from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority in May to operate a virtual bank in the Chinese territory.</p>
      <p>Ant’s payments app Alipay and its local e-wallet partners had about 900 million annual active users in China and 1.2 billion globally as of June, according to <i>Bloomberg Intelligence</i>.</p>
