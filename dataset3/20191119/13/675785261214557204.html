      <h1>Mum's heartbreaking plea for dying son, 8, answered by X Factor winner</h1>
      <h2>X Factor star Sam Bailey cut short a family trip to sing in Coventry for little eight-year-old Bailey, who has just days to live</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:13:42+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:13</time> by <a rel="author">Kelly-Ann Mills, Claire Harrison, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>A desperate mum, who made a touching plea for singers to help put a smile on her dying son's face, has been overwhelmed by the response.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/x-factor">X Factor</a> winner Sam Bailey,  Andy Bennett from Ocean Colour Scene and enough musicians to play for the next two weeks have answered mum Charlotte's Nixon's appeal.</p>
      <p>Charlotte's son Bailey is just eight years old and is terminally ill.</p>
      <p>He is spending most of his days sleeping, barely opening his eyes except to cry when he needs medication, but his mum says he smiles when he hears music and loves guitars.</p>
      <p>Mum Charlotte told <a href="https://www.coventrytelegraph.net/">Coventry Live</a> : "Because he spends a lot time asleep, they say the last things to go are your hearing and your smell, so I just thought 'well let's try and do something'.</p>

      <p>"There is nothing I can buy him, there is nothing he needs, there is nothing anyone else can do. He is going to die, we are looking at days, maybe a couple of weeks.</p>
      <p>"I can't change that, there is nothing I can do about that. But you know what, while he is here, even if I can do a little bit of something for him, I will. I will do anything.</p>
      <p>"He loves guitars and I just thought I would see if I could get some music therapy for him, I thought I would probably get someone say 'oh I don't know anyone'  and that would be it - I didn't think for one minute it would be like this.</p>
      <p>"I am so grateful. It has been absolutely beautiful, people have been taking time out of their lives for my son."</p>

      <p>After Charlotte's appeal last week offers have come in from around the world.</p>
      <p>She added: "If you don't live in our kind of life with kids like Bailey, people don't realise the little things do mean a lot.</p>
      <p>"He is my son, for anyone to take time out of their lives to help me and my son, it is just amazing, it really is amazing.</p>
      <p>"I have never done anything like this, I have never asked for anything in all of the years he has been alive because that's not me, that is not who I am, we fend for ourselves.</p>
      <p>"It was just a little off the cuff thing, I thought 'he would love a bit of music played', that's how it all started and I cannot believe where we are now."</p>
      <p>Sam Bailey turned up alone at the family home and sang for little Bailey.</p>
      <p>Mum Charlotte added: "She is just so normal," Charlotte said.</p>

      <p>"It was funny, I opened the front door and she came in and I looked around her, but she didn't have anyone with her, she'd just come on her own. She was so good.</p>
      <p>"She has messaged me every day since, just asking how the little man is, she has been absolutely brilliant."</p>
      <p>She added: "I would like to thank everyone, every single person who has messaged me or been in touch with me to help my son, thank you so much.</p>
      <p>"It means so much. If this means Bailey has left one little footprint on the world, then I thank them all for it."</p>
      <p>Bailey was born with a life-limiting brain condition which has led to Epilepsy, severe gut issues, dystonia and global developmental delay.</p>
