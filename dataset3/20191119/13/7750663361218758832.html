      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/liverpool/"><b>Liverpool</b></a> target <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ryan-fraser/"><b>Ryan Fraser</b></a> has admitted that he is feeling unhappy at <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/bournemouth/"><b>Bournemouth</b></a> this season due to a sense of loneliness.</h2>

      <p>Fraser has played a fundamental role for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/eddie-howe/"><b>Eddie Howe</b></a>'s side in the Premier League since 2016 but his performances this term have dipped below their normal standards, with the winger only managing one goal from 11 games.</p>
      <p>Liverpool are said to be <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/liverpool/transfer-talk/news/liverpool-in-advanced-talks-for-fraser_378659.html?t1573494548">'in advanced talks'</a> with Bournemouth about the potential transfer of the 25-year-old in January.</p>
      <p>Reflecting on teammate <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/marc-pugh/"><b>Marc Pugh</b></a> leaving the Vitality Stadium over the summer, Fraser told the <i>Bournemouth Echo</i>: "He's my best mate off the pitch so to see him go on loan (to Hull last season) was hard.</p>
      <p>"I was obviously back to being a loner again! Pughie is Pughie. You can't say a bad word about Pughie. He's probably one of the nicest guys. Nath (Ake) is up there as well and then I'd say myself maybe third! Me, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/shaun-macdonald/"><b>Shaun MacDonald</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/wes-fogden/"><b>Wes Fogden</b></a> always used to do stuff together.</p>
      <p>"So obviously losing one and then we keep losing them and then last season was hard – I used to go and have a coffee with Pughie, but it wasn't like that. So you end up just going home and doing nothing. It's hard to take."</p>
      <p>Fraser, who joined Bournemouth when they were in League One, will be a free agent once the 2019-20 campaign concludes.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/transfer-talk/news/arsenal-told-to-pay-gbp25m-for-fraser_362474.html">Reports have also claimed</a> that Arsenal are interested in making a bid for Fraser, who is valued at between £10m and £15m.</p>
