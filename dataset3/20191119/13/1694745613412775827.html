      <h1>Watch Kacey Musgraves and Willie Nelson Share the Sweetest Duet at the CMA Awards</h1>

      <p>Willie Nelson hasn't performed on the CMA Awards stage since 2012, but his Wednesday night duet <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/see-full-cma-winners-list-2019-46894561">with Kacey Musgraves</a> was well worth the wait. The two country stars teamed up for a beautiful, gentle rendition of "Rainbow Connection," the iconic <b>Muppet Movie</b> song originally performed by Kermit the Frog. No one will ever be able to touch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WS3Lkc6Gzlk">Kermit's earnestly froggy performance</a>, but Musgraves and Nelson gave it their best.</p>
      <p>This isn't the first time the two musicians have created music magic together â€” Musgraves tapped Nelson <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/entertainment/Best-Kacey-Musgraves-Songs-Playlist-45756727">to feature on her</a> <b>Pageant Material</b> single "Are You Sure?" in 2015, then on her holiday record, <b>A Very Kacey Christmas</b>. The two reuniting on the stage at Nashville's Bridgestone Arena to celebrate the song's 40th anniversary was <a href="https://www.popsugar.com/celebrity/best-pictures-from-2019-cma-awards-46898845">one of the most memorable moments of the night</a>. Watch their performance above!</p>
