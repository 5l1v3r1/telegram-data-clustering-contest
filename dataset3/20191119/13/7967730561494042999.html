      <h1>Sydney Water proposes increase in price as drought hits revenue, supply</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Julie Power and Alexandra Smith</a></address>
      <p>Sydneysiders are using higher than average amounts of water and face the prospect of four more years of restrictions and a hike in bills from next July if the drought does not break.</p>
      <p>Sydney Water has submitted a revised submission to the Independent Pricing Regulatory Tribunal (IPART) for a proposal that would see annual water bills rise by $30 a year with dam levels on Tuesday sinking to 46.3 per cent. The state government is also expected to soon announce the expansion of the desalination plant.</p>

      <p>It comes as the latest WaterNSW Greater Sydney Operations Plan reveals monthly water usage in Sydney since November last year has been higher than the city's five-year average.</p>
      <p>This is despite Sydney moving to its first water restrictions in almost a decade on June 1, when dam levels reached 53.2 per cent, and the NSW government spending more than $9 million on an awareness campaign to encourage people to save water.</p>
      <p>The government predicts level 2 water restrictions will be needed in early February when dam levels are expected to drop to 40 per cent.</p>

      <p>Sydney Water's revised submission to IPART has asked the pricing regulator for increases and a 20 per cent increase in capital spending to $11.4 billion from 2020 to 2024 to respond to the drought and for new infrastructure.</p>
      <p>Sydney Water's initial submission would have reduced prices but managing director Roch Cheroux said the utility now had "more certainty of drought conditions" from 2020 to 2024 than it did six months ago.</p>
      <p>"We need to ensure that we have enough funding to respond to drought and improve our water resilience for our customers and our city," Mr Cheroux said. "Some of our additional expenditure will improve system resilience for the longer term ... Other expenditure will only be needed while drought conditions continue."</p>
      <p>Sydney Water said its proposed increased spending reflected that "dry conditions and drought may also be ongoing impacts of climate change, not just temporary aberrations".</p>
      <p>It said 38 per cent of Sydney's population knew the city was in a drought earlier this year. Awareness had risen to 78 per cent, but Sydney Water said it needed to do more to increase water efficiency.</p>

      <p>Although a typical household bill would be 2.5 per cent higher under the latest submission, customers could cut bills by saving water. Using 20 per cent less water would save $100 a year.</p>
      <p>But despite a recent increase in usage, the Berejiklian government says Sydneysiders are using less water per person each day than they were during the Millennium drought.</p>
      <p>The WaterNSW plan shows at the height of that drought between 2001 and 2003, Sydneysiders were using 250 litres of water per person per day.</p>
      <p>Water Minister Melinda Pavey said Sydneysiders had changed their ways since the last drought.</p>
      <p>“The people of Sydney are responding to one of the worst droughts on record by reducing their consumption, but there is more to do," Ms Pavey said.</p>
      <p>“Sydney is not immune from the drought, with 99 per cent of the state now affected and some regional communities facing up to level 4 and 5 water restrictions."</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Ms Pavey said the increased water usage was because of the "extraordinary dry and warm conditions experienced recently – especially when compared with the five-year average, which included wetter periods".</p>
      <p>The WaterNSW plan said while there have been "isolated rainfall events", recent conditions have quickly dried out Sydney's catchments.</p>
      <p>It says rainfall across the catchments over the past two years was "below to very much below average" and the Bureau of Meteorology predicts a dryer and warmer than average summer.</p>

      <p>"Despite some water being available for Shoalhaven transfers and the Sydney Desalination Plant being online, there has been a gradual decline in storage levels and drought conditions remain throughout the Sydney catchments," the plan says.</p>
      <p>Independent upper house MLC Justin Field said the government should move to level 2 water restrictions before summer hits.</p>
      <p>"The above average water use across Sydney since restrictions started in June shows the government isn't doing enough to alert the public to the seriousness of rapidly falling dam levels and to curb water use," he said.</p>
      <p>“They're transferring more and more water from the Shoalhaven to avoid the political pain of water restrictions in Sydney which is simply not fair and sets Sydney up for failure."</p>
