      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:05:05+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:05</time> by <a rel="author">Ciaran Kelly</a></address>
      <p>Unai Emery is set to hold talks with Granit Xhaka when the Arsenal midfielder returns from international duty as <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle United</a> boss <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/steve-bruce">Steve Bruce</a> continues to monitor his situation.</p>
      <p>Xhaka has not played for <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">the Gunners</a> since an angry confrontation with the club's fans after being substituted in the 2-2 draw against Crystal Palace on October 27.</p>
      <p>Having stripped Xhaka of the captaincy, Emery has already spoken to club chiefs about whether the midfielder should be sold in January but has stopped short of saying he has played his last game for the club.</p>
      <p>Bruce is an admirer of the Switzerland international and while the Newcastle head coach recognises the January market is a difficult one to do business in, occasionally an unexpected opportunity emerges.</p>
      <p>The 58-year-old has made good use of the loan system at previous clubs and convinced Hatem Ben Arfa and Robert Snodgrass to come to Hull City and Aston Villa respectively.</p>

      <p>Bruce feels his side are a little short in the midfield areas but is prepared to wait until the summer if there is not a player available in the mid-season window who can improve what he already has.</p>
      <p>Xhaka is friends with Newcastle defender Fabian Schar and the Switzerland players regularly talk to each other about their club situations; Xhaka helped convince Stephan Lichtsteiner to move to Arsenal last year, for example.</p>
      <p>The 27-year-old is due back at Arsenal's training ground this week, after playing in Switzerland's wins against Georgia and Gibraltar, and remains a popular figure in the dressing room.</p>
      <p>Not only did the majority of Xhaka's team-mates vote for him to be captain back in September but a number of his colleagues visited him after the dramatic incident against Palace.</p>
      <p>Xhaka is settled in London - vowing to stay positive as he trains hard behind the scenes - and still has three-and-a-half years to run on a lucrative contract at the Emirates.</p>
      <p>The player's age, too, goes against Newcastle's transfer policy. Andy Carroll was the only player above the age of 25 that Newcastle signed last summer, on a highly-incentivised deal, but Bruce previously said he would try and make the case if an older target became available.</p>
      <p>"How old’s Schar? How old's Fernandez? How old's Muto? There’s a few where the club have brought more proven players in," he told reporters earlier this month.</p>
      <p>"Look, if there’s a player out there who I think can improve us, and he’s 28, then I’ll go and knock on the door and I’ll make my case.</p>
      <p>"If we can get him, brilliant. Sometimes, you have to go and get one or two players like that. If you can do the loan market as well, then that’s always an option, too. There’s always somebody out there."</p>
