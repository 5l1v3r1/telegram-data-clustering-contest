      <p><i>The Outer Worlds </i>and <i>Death Stranding </i>are two games I'm very into right now, but they both contain lots of little words that can be a struggle to make out. I can't imagine what it's been like for folks playing on a responsible-human-sized TV, or anyone who likes to sit a decent distance away from their screen.</p>
      <p>Obsidian has heard our pleas for bigger text. As of patch 1.1, <i><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-the-outer-worlds-569391.phtml">The Outer Worlds</a> </i>now has an option to increase the font size – you can find it inside the Settings menu, tucked away in the UI tab.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mbmynq/the-outer-worlds-gets-patch-to-increase-very-tiny-text-size-to-just-tiny">VICE</a>, the biggest increase is found in conversational text – a major facet of this chatty RPG – but item descriptions in your inventory might still be tough to pin down, toggle or no toggle.</p>
      <p>Update 1.1 isn't solely here to bump up the font, though. There are also fixes and tweaks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The game crashing at a specific point when the player has reached Tartarus has been resolved.</li>
        <li>Players will no longer experience muffled sounds when playing on the PlayStation 4.</li>
        <li>The Prismatic Hammer has been rebalanced and no longer incorrectly uses the level multiplier as an exponent instead of a multiplier and will no longer do 10s of thousands of points of damage at a higher level. Now deals the damage it should have been dealing all along.</li>
        <li>Existing Botched companion quests will have their status reset to Active allowing the player to add them to a party when leaving the ship in order to un-botch the quests, unless the death occurred prior to unlocking the companion quest.</li>
        <li>Fix for "Radio Free Monarch" where issues would happen when talking to Nayoka while having SAM in your party.</li>
        <li>Foliage on the Xbox One now has parity with the foliage on PlayStation 4.</li>
        <li>The achievement/trophy for "It's Not the Best Choice" will pop correctly.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I'm looking forward to getting back to my crew once I lighten my backlog a bit more.</p>
