      <h1>The backlash Meghan Markle received for deciding to miss Christmas with the Queen is just another example of the double standards she's up against, Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore</h1>

        <li><a href="https://www.insider.com/category/meghan-markle">The Duchess of Sussex</a> is being criticized after announcing <a href="https://www.insider.com/meghan-markle-prince-harry-archie-christmas-us-doria-ragland-2019-11">plans to spend Christmas with her mother, Doria Ragland</a>, instead of the Queen.</li>
        <li>Despite a Buckingham Palace spokesperson announcing that Meghan Markle and Prince Harry’s decision “has the support of Her Majesty the Queen,” they were still accused of <a href="https://www.newidea.com.au/queen-elizabeth-supports-meghan-markle-prince-harry-christmas-away">“snubbing” the monarch</a> in the press.</li>
        <li>However, the duke and duchess are not the first royals to to make their own plans for the holiday season, as royal commentator Joe Little told Insider.</li>
        <li>“The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge spent Christmas 2016 with her family in Berkshire, so what the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have planned for this Christmas is absolutely no different,” he said.</li>
        <li>Piers Morgan suggested that the only reason Markle would want to spend time with her mother, and not the Queen, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7686455/PIERS-MORGAN-Harry-Meghan-stop-behaving-like-spoiled-brats.html">would be to escape the British press.</a></li>
        <li>However, in 2012 – the same year that Middleton first missed Christmas at Sandringham – the duchess <a href="https://www.insider.com/biggest-royal-scandals-past-decade-meghan-markle-kate-middleton-2019-11">was also involved in her own battle with the press.</a></li>
        <li>The reaction to Markle’s holiday plans is <a href="https://www.insider.com/meghan-markle-criticized-kate-middleton-praised-double-standards-racism-2019-11">yet another example of the double standards placed on the duchess.</a></li>

      <p><a href="https://www.insider.com/category/meghan-markle">Meghan Markle</a> is again being blasted by critics who claim she is “snubbing the Queen” by <a href="https://www.insider.com/meghan-markle-prince-harry-archie-christmas-us-doria-ragland-2019-11">choosing to spend Chrsitmas with her mother instead of the royal family.</a></p>
      <p>Despite a Buckingham Palace spokesperson saying the couple “has the support of Her Majesty the Queen,” this hasn’t stopped royal watchers from criticizing the decision.</p>
      <p>“The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are looking forward to extended family time towards the end of this month,” the spokesperson announced.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>“Having spent the last two Christmases at Sandringham, Their Royal Highnesses will spend the holiday this year, as a new family, with the Duchess’ mother Doria Ragland.</p>
      <p>“This decision is in line with precedent set previously by other members of the Royal Family, and has the support of Her Majesty The Queen.”</p>
      <p>While the move may seem newsworthy, it’s not uncommon for royals to make other plans for the festive period, despite what recent headlines would suggest.</p>
      <h3>Will and Kate have skipped Christmas several times before</h3>
      <p>Even though it was made clear that Harry and Markle aren’t the first royals to miss Christmas, the headlines that followed ranged from <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10349126/christmas-queen-prince-harry-meghan/">calling the pair “sulky”</a> to describing the incident as a <a href="https://www.newidea.com.au/queen-elizabeth-supports-meghan-markle-prince-harry-christmas-away">“snub” to the Queen.</a></p>
      <p>Royal commentator Joe Little says this is not a fair depiction of their decision.</p>
      <p>“The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge spent Christmas 2016 with her family in Berkshire, so what the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have planned for this Christmas is absolutely no different,” Little, managing editor at Majesty magazine, told Insider.</p>

      <p>“No snub to the Queen or anything like that. Pretty much everything about them at the moment is being sensationalized by the media.”</p>
      <p>Prince William and Kate Middleton are known to alternate between Sandringham and the Middleton family, and the first time they did this in 2012 – the year after the duchess married into the family – headlines were far more neutral than the ones now describing Harry and Markle’s plans.</p>
      <p>“<a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/kate-middleton/9762659/William-and-Kate-miss-Queens-Christmas-choosing-to-spend-it-with-Middletons.html">William and Kate miss Queen’s Christmas, choosing to spend it with Middletons</a>,” The Telegraph wrote in December 2012.</p>
      <p>“<a href="https://www.hellomagazine.com/royalty/2016121635269/prince-william-and-kate-middleton-spending-christmas-day-with-middleton-family/">Find out why Prince William and Kate won’t be spending Christmas at Sandringham this year</a>,” Hello! Magazine wrote in 2016.</p>
      <p>Both articles wrote that the reason the couple chose to have a more private Christmas – thus not partaking in the famously photographed walk to church with the royal family – was so they could spend time with Middleton’s parents, Carole and Michael.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, this week’s headlines suggested that Markle’s reason for wanting to spend Christmas with her own mother, and not the Queen, is to escape the press.</p>
      <h3>Markle is constantly criticized for doing the same things Middleton is praised for</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7686455/PIERS-MORGAN-Harry-Meghan-stop-behaving-like-spoiled-brats.html">Piers Morgan wrote in his column for the Mail Online</a>: “If Harry and Meghan don’t want negative press, they should stop behaving like whiny spoiled brats and do their damn duty – and they cans start by spending Christmas with the Queen.</p>
      <p>“Barely a week goes by now without them filing lawsuits attacking press freedom, weeping TV tears about the dreadful intrusion they have to endure, or firing off angry directives to newspapers,” Morgan added, in reference to both Markle and Harry’s lawsuits against the British tabloids.</p>
      <p>In October, <a href="https://www.insider.com/meghan-markle-lawsuit-mail-on-sunday-prince-harry-statement-2019-10">Markle announced plans to sue the Mail on Sunday</a> over the misuse of private information, infringement of copyright, and the breach of the Data Protection Act 2018 after the newspaper published extracts from a letter she sent to her father, Thomas Markle, earlier this year.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.insider.com/meghan-markle-suing-british-tabloids-court-papers-stories-taxpayers-money-2019-11">According to documents filed by the duchess’ lawyers</a>, the newspaper published fabricated stories as part of a three-year fake news campaign against her, which included false details about her relationship with her mother, her baby shower, and the renovations made to her Frogmore Cottage home in Windsor.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Harry has issued legal proceedings against the owners of The Sun and the Daily Mirror <a href="https://www.insider.com/prince-harry-phone-hacking-case-british-tabloids-meghan-markle-2019-10">“regarding the illegal interception of voicemail messages.”</a></p>
      <p>However, William and Middleton have also been involved in legal battles with the press. Closer magazine published topless photos of Middleton on its cover in 2012, which <a href="https://www.insider.com/biggest-royal-scandals-past-decade-meghan-markle-kate-middleton-2019-11">resulted in a lawsuit</a> that was finally settled in 2017, when the couple won $118,000 in damages.</p>
      <p>Despite the fact the photos were published in 2012, the same year Middleton first missed Christmas with the royals, the media did not cite this as a factor.</p>
      <p>This isn’t the first time <a href="https://www.insider.com/meghan-markle-criticized-kate-middleton-praised-double-standards-racism-2019-11">Markle has been criticized for doing something that Middleton has been praised for</a>. Previous headlines have accused Markle of attention seeking for cradling her pregnant belly, <a href="https://www.insider.com/meghan-markle-criticized-kate-middleton-praised-double-standards-racism-2019-11">while others called Middleton “glowing” for doing the same thing.</a></p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Markle was accused of breaking protocol for wearing wedged shoes because the Queen “isn’t a fan” of this type of shoe. When Middleton wore them, the same publication wrote that she made them <a href="https://www.insider.com/meghan-markle-criticized-kate-middleton-praised-double-standards-racism-2019-11">“the most versatile shoes of the summer.”</a></p>
      <h3>Christmas isn’t the only private time Harry and Markle spend with the Queen</h3>
      <p>Royal commentator Kristen Meinzer, who <a href="https://www.insider.com/meghan-markle-criticized-kate-middleton-praised-double-standards-racism-2019-11">previously told Insider these double standards could be down to racism</a>, says that royal watchers are wrongly only commenting on what they see played out in the public eye.</p>
      <p>Harry and Markle have a relationship with the Queen behind closed doors, which is something people seem to forget when making these assumptions, Meinzer told Insider.</p>
      <p>“Meghan and Harry have spent the last two Christmases with Harry’s side of the family, and while I’m sure it’s been wonderful, it’s also meant that Meghan has had to be separated from her family for the past two holiday seasons,” she said.</p>
      <p>“I’m so happy that this year, Meghan will be able to celebrate with her mother.</p>
      <p>“As for the inevitable criticism being thrown Meghan’s way from the naysayers and tabloid press, I’d remind people: Kate and William have also skipped the Queen’s festivities at Sandringham.</p>
      <p>“And let’s remember: Christmas isn’t the only time that Harry and Meghan get to see the Queen in a private setting. She and Prince Phillip are their neighbors every weekend, and also during the spring, when they’re in their second home in Windsor.”</p>
