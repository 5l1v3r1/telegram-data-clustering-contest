      <p>A schoolgirl hired a lawyer after being made to read an X-rated poem which discusses ‘being fucked in the ass by saintly motorcyclists.’</p>
      <p>Skylar Carson, a junior at Steamboat Springs High <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/school/">School</a> in Colorado, was horrified when she and her fellow 16 and 17 year-old classmates were asked to study Howl, a controversial 1950s work by Beat poet Allen Ginsberg.</p>
      <p>The lengthy poem, which is split into three parts, discusses the self-destruction of the author’s friends, ‘with drugs, alcohol and cock and endless balls’.</p>
      <p>It goes on to detail both straight and gay sex acts, including a description of sailors ‘scattering their semen freely to whomever come who may.’</p>
      <p>Ginsburg also references a ‘vision of the ultimate c**t’, with the poem filled with visceral images of drug-taking and violence.</p>

      <p>Skylar was stunned by the work, which she and her classmates had to read aloud, and told <a href="https://kdvr.com/2019/11/18/vulgar-poem-sparking-controversy-in-steamboat-springs-classroom/">Fox31</a>: ‘The second we started reading the book it just went south</p>

      <p>‘It was so filled with sexual content that I wasn’t aware of and I wasn’t prepared for.’</p>
      <p>Skylar said no warning was given by teachers about the poem’s contents, with her dad Brett also outraged.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘She came home and shared it with us and of course as a parent the way we’ve raised our kids I was like, there’s no way a teacher in a public school would have done this.’</p>
      <p>Brett says parents should have been informed their children were going to study an explicit work, and be given the chance to opt out of it.</p>

      <p>He added: ‘A lot of the kids, you know, were scared to say anything to their parents because it was so awkward and just weird.’</p>
      <p>Skylar’s teacher has since apologized, admitting students and parents felt ‘blindsided’ and that they should have been ‘exceedingly clear’ about the content of Howl before starting.</p>
      <p>Steamboat Springs School District permits the teaching of controversial works, but rules state parents may have to be informed beforehand.</p>
      <p>They say the poem has now been removed from its curriculum, and also apologized for not giving advance notice about its content.</p>
      <p>The Carsons have hired religious liberty attorney Jeremy Dys.</p>
      <p>He has demanded that all parents receive a letter of apology from the teacher, and that the school undertake sensitivity training to avoid a repeat.</p>

      <p>Howl was published when gay sex was illegal in all 50 US states, and sparked an obscenity trial in 1957, the year after it was published.</p>
      <p>The presiding judge, Clayton Horn, ruled the book was not obscene, and said there was no point in ‘freedom of press or speech if one must reduce his vocabulary to vapid innocuous euphemisms.’</p>
      <p>Ginsberg became one of the most lauded poets of his generation, and died in New York in 1997 aged 70.</p>
