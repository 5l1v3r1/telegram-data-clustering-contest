      <p>Despite being appointed as ruler of the Six Kingdoms in the Game of Thrones finale, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/bran-stark/">Bran Stark</a> never actually made it to the Iron Throne – until now.</p>
      <p>After Jon Snow (played by Kit Harington) plunged a dagger into the heart of Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke), her beloved dragon Drogon torched the Iron Throne to a pile of ash, which <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/21/drogan-presents-glaring-plot-hole-daenerys-death-game-thrones-10952554/">fans have a lot of questions about.</a></p>
      <p>In turn, Jon – the rightful heir to rule Westeros – was banished to The Wall and his little brother Bran was selected to take his place. But he was throneless.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, order has been restored as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/isaac-hempstead-wright/">Isaac Hempstead Wright</a> finally got to take a seat in the iron clad chair that countless warriors and villains sacrificed their lives for throughout eight seasons at last night’s HBO Game of Thrones Celebration, where he was also reunited with co-stars Gemma Whelan (Yara Greyjoy) and Kristofer Hivju (Tormund), who told Metro.co.uk <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/game-thrones-cast-filmed-alternative-ending-season-8-well-never-see-reveals-tormund-star-kristofer-hivju-11179830/">the cast filmed an alternative ending.</a></p>

      <p>The 20-year-old spoke to fans during the event and explained why, understandably, he thinks Bran had the best journey.</p>

      <p>‘I would obviously say this, but I think that Bran had the best character arc,’ he told fans.</p>
      <p>‘In the very first episode you think he’s toast – he’s dead.</p>
      <p>‘He grows and learns the hard way about a lot of things. He goes from being this traditionally vulnerable character to the most powerful person there is.’</p>
      <p>Isaac continued: ‘I was pretty happy with just him becoming the Three-Eyed Raven, but what a great story where this boy – this disabled 10-year-old in the harshest world ever – [comes] to triumph. And so to see him become king and be victorious is so…it’s brilliant to have a disabled character win the whole of Game of Thrones.</p>
      <p>‘I mean, what are the odds of that when you have dragons and all these kinds of things? Bran comes out on top, and it was really special.’</p>
