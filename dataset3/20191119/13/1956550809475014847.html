      <p>From creating gravy and cranberry sauce from scratch to stuffing the turkey, there’s a lot of effort that goes into making a hefty <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/restaurants/419209-thanksgiving-dubai-2019-where-to-get-turkey-takeaway">Thanksgiving</a> dinner this year.</p>
      <p>Well, <a href="https://www.timeoutdubai.com/news/394881-deliveroo-now-lets-you-order-from-different-dubai-restaurants-in-one-delivery">Deliveroo</a> and Baker &amp; Spice in Dubai wantto take the stress out of all that.</p>

      <p>For sides, pick from red cabbage with apple and cranberry, pearl couscous and chicken sausage with cranberry and herbs, traditional sourdough bread stuffing, and roast potato with cumin and zaatar.</p>
