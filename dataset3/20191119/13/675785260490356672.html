      <h1>Prince Andrew made 'unbelievable' racist comments about Arabs, ex-Home Secretary says</h1>
      <h2>Former Home Secretary Jacqui Smith claims the Duke of York made racist comments during a state banquet in allegations on her LBC Election podcast</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:48:19+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:48</time> by <a rel="author">Talia Shadwell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/talia-shadwell/</a></address>
      <p>Prince Andrew has been hauled into a fresh racism row, just days after his 'car crash' interview about his links with Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>Former Home Secretary Jacqui Smith has claimed the Duke of York made "unbelievable" racist comments about Arabs while he mingled with politicians at Buckingham Palace at a state banquet.</p>
      <p>The Palace has rejected the allegations- saying Prince Andrew does not tolerate racism.</p>
      <p>Her claims follow new allegations earlier this morning the Duke used the 'n' word in 2012, as the royal is left reeling in the aftermath of his disastrous BBC interview.</p>
      <p>Ms Smith, made the new allegations about the Duke's behaviour on the LBC Election podcast she co-hosts with station host Iain Dale.</p>

      <p>In the recording she refuses to repeat what the Duke is alleged to have said, claiming "I met him [Prince Andrew] several times, including once at a state banquet where after dinner, I and my husband and another Labour Cabinet minister had a drink with him, and I have to say the conversation left us slack-jawed with the things that he felt it was appropriate to say."</p>
      <p>She does not give details of when or where the state banquet took place during the recording.</p>
      <p>However after being asked during the segment what the Prince allegedly said, Ms Smith replies: "I almost feel like I can't say it. It was a state dinner for the Saudi royal family and he made racist comments about Arabs that were unbelievable.</p>

      <p>"The fact he thought we might find these amusing was sort of a terrible situation to be in. I don't think he's very bright. I don't think he really understands the way in which he behaves. He's the worst end of the royal family, I think."</p>
      <p>Ms Smith added that she felt ashamed for not challenging the Prince on the claimed remarks, adding: 'It was a state banquet, we were in Buckingham Palace, we were cabinet ministers, I feel ashamed that we didn't but we didn't.'</p>
      <p>A Palace spokesperson told the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7701201/Prince-Andrew-unbelievable-racist-comments-Arabs-claims-ex-Home-Secretary-Jacqui-Smith.html">Mail Online</a>:  '"HRH has undertaken a considerable amount of work in the Middle East over a period of years and has many friends from the region.</p>

      <p>The fallout following the prince's disastrous BBC interview has not been limited to scrutiny of his friendship with the disgraced billionaire.</p>
      <p>BBC Newsnight's Emily Maitlis also probed him about claims from Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre, that he had sex with her on three occasions when she was 17.</p>
      <p>Prince Andrew has denied the allegations.</p>

      <p>But the spotlight has barely left the Duke of York, 59, since Saturday night's interview, as yet more accusations piling up about his past behaviour piles pressure on the Royal Family.</p>
      <p>Among the allegations to emerge since his BBC Two interview was  a claim he made a racist remark in 2012 to a Downing Street adviser of Sri Lankan descent.</p>
      <p>Palace sources have denied the claim, which  Ex-government aide Rohan Silva made earlier today.</p>
      <p>Mr Silva said he asked the duke whether the government department responsible for trade “could be doing a better job”.</p>
      <p>He alleged the Queen's second son responded: “Well, If you’ll pardon the expression, that really is the n***** in the woodpile.”</p>
      <p>Palace sources categorically deny Andrew ever used the phrase, insisting he would never use such language, reports the <a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/prince-andrew-caught-in-nword-row-former-downing-street-aide-rohan-silva-accuses-duke-of-york-of-a4289516.html">London Evening Standard.</a></p>
