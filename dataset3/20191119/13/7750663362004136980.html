      <p>The 26-year-old left-back, who joined the Clarets from Leeds in the summer of 2017, made his 50th Premier League appearance earlier this season and has now committed his future until 2023.</p>
      <p>"I've thoroughly enjoyed my time here so far and I'm looking forward to the next few years ahead," he said.</p>
      <p>"The next few years are hopefully the peak years of my career. I've signed up to Burnley to spend them here and hopefully the best years are to come.</p>
      <p>"Ever since I made my debut in the Premier League I've wanted to stay here. I think once you have a taste of the Premier League you don't want to go anywhere else.</p>
      <p>"We have been in the Premier League since I arrived and that's where I want to stay."</p>
      <p>Taylor, whose existing deal was due to run until 2021, is the third player to recently sign a new contract after forwards <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ashley-barnes/"><b>Ashley Barnes</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/chris-wood/"><b>Chris Wood</b></a>.</p>
      <p>He featured in every Premier League match in the previous campaign but has faced competition from <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/erik-pieters/"><b>Erik Pieters</b></a> this season and has made just three appearances, with his only start coming last time out against West Ham with his rival out injured.</p>
      <p>"I've said before that all any professional wants to do is play. It's been frustrating at times, but it's also been worth it," added Taylor.</p>
      <p>"We have a very competitive squad, which bodes well for now and the future, and I'm delighted that I'm going to be part of it for the future."</p>
