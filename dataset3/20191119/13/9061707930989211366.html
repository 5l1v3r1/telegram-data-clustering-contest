      <h2>It's busy times in the town centre</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:29:12+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:29</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Waldron</a></address>
      <p>A new vaping shop is set to open in a major Burton shopping centre.</p>
      <p>Signs have gone up in the window of the former <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/coopers-square-shopping-centre">Heaven Scent</a> unit saying Electromist is set to "open soon".</p>
      <p>The electronic cigarettes and e-liquid suppliers boasts more than 20 stores across the United Kingdom, including in Lichfield, Lancaster and Telford.</p>
      <p>According to the firm's website, it "prides itself" on offering more than 30 lines of "juices", hardware and more for vaping.</p>
      <p>The description reads: "Needless to say, whatever stage you're at <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/burton">on your vaping journey</a>, we've got you covered."</p>
      <p>The sign in the shop window reads: "Electromist. Store opening here. Coming soon."</p>
      <p>The unit has sat vacant for more than a year after Heaven Scent closed in June 2018.</p>

      <p>The cosmetics and perfume store shut after nearly 40 years of trading.</p>
      <p>As well as its store in the shopping centre store, it had branches on the junction of High Street and New Street.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/coopers-square-shopping-centre">Coopers Square</a> has been boosted by a number of stores opening in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>Independent women's clothing store Remona opened recently, with a sweet shop set to join it in the coming weeks.</p>
      <p>Dave Chadfield, centre manager at Coopers Square shopping centre said: "Following the openings of Remona and Grab &amp; Go, we're pleased to now also be welcoming Electromist to the shopping centre.</p>
      <p>"Over the last few years, it has established a strong presence across the Midlands and has proven to be a popular addition to Burton.</p>
      <p>"Electromist has built up a good reputation for the knowledge, advice and safety tips it offers when it comes to E-Cigarettes and E-Liquid.</p>
      <p>"We're pleased it will be opening with us at Coopers Square in the near future."</p>
      <p>Burton Live has contacted Electromist for more information.</p>
