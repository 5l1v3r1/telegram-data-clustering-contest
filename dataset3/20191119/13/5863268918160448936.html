      <p>ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – National Accountability Bureau (NAB) Chairman retired justice Javed Iqbal asserted on Tuesday that no National Reconciliation Ordinance (NRO) would be made from the bureau’s part.</p>
      <p>He addressed a ceremony held in the honour of officers of the NAB in Islamabad, and said: “One person gets medical treatment in London or America, whereas other people do not.”</p>
      <p>“No one should expect that the bureau will turn a blind eye towards ‘a person in power’ […] no one should anticipate that the ruling party has no responsibility.”</p>
      <p>“No deal or relief will be struck from the NAB’s side,” he said, adding that making any compromise or surrender was out of question.</p>
      <p>“Those people who have never read the NAB law are also criticising it […] I am not crying over lack of resources but the available resources should be utilised at their maximum efficiency,” he said.</p>
      <p>The chairman questioned: “Why would the NAB take political revenge from someone? […] if someone is arrested today, the very next day, [the arrested person] says that political revenge is being taken.”</p>
      <p>“That person who is in the record of the NAB will never appreciate it […] accusing, vilifying or making threats towards me is of no benefit,” he added.</p>
      <p>He pointed out that the country has been under debt of more than US $100 billion, and stated: “You think asking for its calculation is a crime!”</p>
      <p>He mentioned that after 2017, no mega scandal has been unearthed and the bureau had focused on those cases which had been pending for a long time.</p>
      <p>“It is asked what has the NAB done for the BRT […] the Supreme Court had given a stay order and we are trying to resolve the matter,” he outlined. “If arresting criminals is a crime, then this crime will go on,” he said.</p>
      <p>He strongly criticised “some people for using a province card” and said the bureau’s activities would remain unaffected by this.</p>
      <p>Mr Iqbal expressed strong reservations that the budget of multimillions of rupees has been allocated but people were being dying in dog-bite cases.</p>
      <p>“Some people even treat their influenza virus in London, are other people not humans?” he asked. Moreover, he emphasised on increasing the number of judges in the country.</p>
