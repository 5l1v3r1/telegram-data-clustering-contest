      <p>Argentine superstar <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1230698-premier-league-top-scorers-aguero-ranks-7th-scoring-watfords-victory.html">Sergio Aguero is the current sixth all-time Premier League highest goals scorer</a> with 173 goals at the time of this report.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old forward joined Manchester City in 2011 from Atletico Madrid, and since then has been superb for the Citizens - winning four EPL titles among others.</p>
      <p>He also played a key role in helping his side become the first team in England to win domestic treble after winning all the titles available in the season.</p>
      <p>Although, they failed to make it to the UEFA Champions League final after being bundled out by Tottenham Hotspur at the quarterfinal stage.</p>

      <p>However, Aguero was expected to join Chelsea after leaving his former La Liga side but the Blues captain John Terry was said to have blocked the move from happening.</p>

      <p>Give Me Sport quoting Simon Johnson claims the lethal striker was Stamford Bridge bound in 2011 but principalities at the stadium refused to allow the deal see the light of the day.</p>

      <p>The west London club made an offer Atletico Madrid in 2009 and were initially put off by the strikers £40 million fee, as well as his high <a href="https://www.legit.ng/tag/minimum-wage.html">wage</a> demands.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Terry, who had much influence in the dressing room at that time claimed he was not impressed with the player's movement on the ball - hence, no need to sign him.</p>
      <p>Reports revealed that the former Aston Villa star wanted David Villa instead but they could not land either player at the end of the day.</p>
