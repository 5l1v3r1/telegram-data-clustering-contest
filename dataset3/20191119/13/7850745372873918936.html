      <h1>Rwanda deports 5 Ugandans, declares them prohibited immigrants</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:25:26+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:25</time> by <a rel="author">URN</a></address>
      <p>Five Ugandans who were being detained in Rwanda have been deported and declared prohibited immigrants. </p>
      <p>They are Gilbert Beingana, Amos Tibesiga and Nicholas Tumwesigye, all residents of Kabale district. Others include; Ivan Nirinyiyimana and Beatha Nyiramuco, from Kisoro district.</p>
      <p>The five were arrested last week for illegal entry into Rwanda. In a statement released today Tuesday by Francois Regis Gatarahiya, Rwanda’s director general of Immigration and Emigration, the five were deported back to Uganda because they were prohibited immigrants in Rwanda.</p>
      <p>Gideon Turyatunga, a brother to Beingana says that the five were deported and dumped at Uganda-Rwanda border of Chanika in Kisoro district today morning. </p>
      <p>Diplomatic tensions between Uganda and Rwanda are at their lowest following the shooting dead of two Ugandans two weeks ago on allegations of smuggling leading to a strong protest from Uganda.</p>
      <p>Rwanda closed its borders with Uganda in February 2019 with Rwanda President Paul Kagame later accusing Ugandan authorities of abducting its citizens and locking them up in ungazetted areas. Rwanda also accused Uganda of hosting and facilitating dissidents especially Rwanda National Congress (RNC) and the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), which have declared war on the Kigali government. </p>
      <p>Rwanda advised its citizens against travelling to Uganda, saying it can't guarantee their safety. Likewise, Uganda accused Rwanda of destabilising its internal security by infiltrating her security agencies. </p>
