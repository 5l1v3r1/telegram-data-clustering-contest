      <h1>Cricket star Meg Lanning has come from the only girl on the team to Australian cricket captain</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:17:12+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/clint-thomas/7550474" target="_blank">Clint Thomas</a></address>
      <p>Meg Lanning has emerged as a household name in world cricket as captain of both Australia and the Perth Scorchers.</p>
      <p>But perhaps even more significantly she has become what she never had as a kid growing up — a visible cricket role model for young girls.</p>
      <p>"We really didn't get to see them [female cricketers] on our TVs or in the news," she told the ABC.</p>
      <blockquote>"So, Ricky Ponting was the person I looked up to.</blockquote>
      <p>"I just loved watching him bat and captain and he seemed to be really competitive, which is similar to me as well.</p>
      <p>"I really didn't realise how much women's cricket there was until I got involved a little bit more."</p>
      <h3>The challenge of finding a team</h3>
      <p>But even finding a way to get involved in the game when at primary school proved difficult for Lanning.</p>
      <p>She found a female senior club side, but as a 12-year-old Lanning was too young for that.</p>

      <p>A talented student and cricketer at Carey Grammar in Melbourne, Lanning also had the hurdle of there being no girls' team at the co-educational private school.</p>
      <p>But once she reached Year 7, the solution was for Lanning to play in the Associated Private Schools (APS) competition for the Carey Grammar boys' team.</p>
      <p>She was the first girl to do so and it got people's attention.</p>
      <p>"We also had schools like Melbourne Grammar, Xavier College and Scotch College who were all boys' schools. so that was a little bit different," Lanning recalled.</p>
      <p>"There were a few articles and talk about it at the time, but I wasn't too sure what all the fuss was about honestly."</p>
      <p>She soon proved to be more than capable of playing at that level.</p>
      <p>"Initially I guess they were a little bit surprised," she said.</p>

      <p>"I started doing it from Year 7 so once you start doing it a few times, [it showed] I could compete with them as well, which probably helped.</p>
      <p>"I played all the way through until the end of Year 12, so once I got to the back end of it was just sort of normal I guess.</p>
      <p>"It was actually a really good pathway for me to go through."</p>
      <h3>From school player to international star</h3>
      <p>Fast forward a few years and Lanning is now a star dominating world cricket.</p>
      <p>In 2014, at the age of 21, Lanning became the youngest captain of Australia when she replaced an injured Jodie Fields in that year's Ashes series.</p>
      <p>Soon after, she was named Wisden's inaugural Leading Female Cricketer in the World.</p>
      <p>The top-order batter has scored 13 one-day centuries for Australia at an average of almost 53.</p>
      <p>Last year, Lanning captained Australia to a fourth ICC Women's World T20 title.</p>

      <p>Lanning said her and the Australian team's success was helping normalise the female game with the public.</p>
      <p>"That is changing over time I think," she said.</p>
      <p>"We can still keep thinking about how we go about that sort of stuff, but from where I started until now it has been a massive shift and we are certainly in a pretty good space, which is great."</p>
      <p>Lanning's Australian team is currently on a world record 18-game winning streak in one-day internationals.</p>
      <p>There will be opportunity for more silverware early next year when Australia hosts the women's T20 World Cup.</p>
      <p>Organisers hope the tournament's final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground — which will be held on International Women's Day in March — will set a new world record for attendance at a women's sporting event.</p>
