      <h1>Hurricane Emily Smith is facing a heavy-handed ban, but she broke Cricket Australia's golden rule</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:13:01+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/chris-rowbottom/8663196" target="_blank">Chris Rowbottom</a></address>
      <p>It was an innocent video of the Hobart Hurricanes' batting line-up that led to Emily Smith feeling the force of Cricket Australia's anti-corruption policy.</p>
      <h3>Key points:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Emily Smith is a 24-year-old wicketkeeper who plays for the Hobart Hurricanes in the Women's Big Bash League</li>
        <li>Smith posted a video revealing the team line-up to her personal Instagram account approximately an hour before its official scheduled release on November 2</li>
        <li>Her actions, found in breach of Cricket Australia's anti-corruption policy, has resulted in a ban — which some have said is too-heavy handed in light of other transgressions by other players</li>
      </ul>
      <p>While waiting out a rain delay ahead of the 'Canes clash with the Sydney Thunder in Burnie, in Tasmania's north, Smith — a known prankster amongst her teammates — <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-18/hobart-hurricanes-wbbl-cricket-emily-smith-banned-for-12-months/11715608">uploaded the video to her Instagram followers</a> in an attempt to poke fun at her lowly batting position.</p>
      <p>But Cricket Australia wasn't laughing — the batting order is seen as "inside information".</p>
      <p>Under its anti-corruption policy, the wicketkeeper has been slammed with a 12-month ban from playing cricket, with nine of those suspended.</p>
      <p>It will see Smith miss a total of 11 matches across the Women's Big Bash League (WBBL) and Women's National Cricket League (WNCL) seasons, not including finals.</p>
      <p>As harsh as it seems, she should not be overly surprised.</p>
      <p>Players and team staff know that phones are forbidden inside changerooms, and are well-educated in Cricket Australia's anti-corruption policy.</p>
      <p>But it is when Smith's punishment is compared to other cricketing and sporting crimes that the conversation sprouts into something more.</p>
      <h3>Corruption, match-fixing outweigh other sporting sins</h3>
      <p>Of all the horsemen of the cricketing apocalypse, it is corruption that Cricket Australia fears most.</p>
      <p>It is held in such grave terms, that Smith's three-month suspension is only six months shorter than that of Cam Bancroft, who was found <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-25/cameron-bancroft-ball-tampering/9583794">guilty of ball-tampering during an international test fixture</a>.</p>
      <p>Smith's punishment is within nine months of the bans handed to <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-29/steve-smith-apologises-for-ball-tampering-scandal/9603670">Steve Smith</a> and Dave Warner for their parts in the incident, which has been described as the <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-29/you-say-the-ball-tampering-culprits-got-what-they-deserved/9600978">greatest disgrace in Australian sporting history</a>, the fallout of which saw the <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-25/smith-warner-stand-down-as-captain-vice-captain-for-rest-of-test/9585260">duo dumped as team leaders</a> and <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-29/darren-lehmann-steps-down-over-ball-tampering-scandal/9604014">national coach Darren Lehmann</a> and Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland step down.</p>

      <p>Just this week, <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-17/james-pattinson-banned-for-first-test-vs-pakistan-at-gabba/11711982">Test hopeful James Pattinson was given a one-Test sanction for making a homophobic slur</a> against Queensland paceman Cameron Gannon.</p>
      <h3>Fears WBBL ripe for match fixers</h3>
      <p>But Emily Smith's punishment is heavy-handed because corruption and match-fixing outrank homophobia and bringing the game into disrepute in the eyes of the sport's governing body.</p>
      <p>There is no suggestion that Smith was attempting to influence the outcome of the match, or profit in any way from her post.</p>
      <p>It is hard to see how it wasn't an honest mistake.</p>

      <p>There is a perception though that competitions like the WBBL could be ripe for match fixers, given the frequency of the matches during the season and the relatively low pay packets of the players involved.</p>
      <p>Where a professional male player earning hundreds of thousands of dollars would require an equally large sum to be tempted to throw a match, a WBBL player whose average wage sits at about $50,000 could be tempted for far less.</p>
      <p>Outgoing Cricket Tasmania CEO Nick Cummins says millions of dollars are already being wagered on the Big Bash, including the WBBL.</p>
      <p>"All forms of cricket are very appealing to punters in all different countries," he said.</p>
      <blockquote>"It's a tens-of-millions-of-dollars industry and that's just not the Big Bash, that's the women's game as well; hence why there's strong measures around anti-corruption when it comes to these games."</blockquote>
      <p>The severity of the punishment handed down to Smith shows there is a susceptibility in the women's game that Cricket Australia is clearly fearful of.</p>
      <p>While heavy sanctions like the one imposed on Smith will surely send a strong message to the rest of the competition, perhaps arming the players with better tools to resist any potential temptation might be more effective.</p>
