      <p>Peter Andre shrugged off parenting critics calling him out for being "too strict" to his children.</p>
      <p>Instead, the Mysterious Girl hitmaker insisted he was in the right for being hard on his kids and gave an example of his parenting style.</p>
      <p>The pop diva's daughter Princess, 12, had a detention for talking in class but Peter said this wasn't enough punishment for her.</p>
      <p>So the singer confiscated all of her electronics for the time being.</p>
      <p>The I'm A Celeb reality star refused to give the devices back when Princess asked for them after saying she had learnt her lesson.</p>
      <p>Yet Peter remained unapologetic for his drastic actions as he set out his reasons why in his latest <a href="https://www.facebook.com/newmagazineuk/">new! column</a> .</p>
      <p>He penned: "I had a proud dad moment last week. Bista came home from school and told me she'd been given a detention for talking during an assembly after being told to stop by a teacher.</p>

      <p>"I asked her what she thought her punishment should be and she told me I should take her electronics away for awhile. So that's what I did. I had planned to do that anyway, but the fact that she thought it was a reasonable punishment impressed me.</p>
      <p>"Some people think I'm too strict but she has since told me she has learned from her mistake and never wants to get a detention again."</p>
      <p>Peter raises his two kids Princess and Junior, 14, with his first ex-wife <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/katie-price">Katie Price</a> .</p>

      <p>They had first crossed paths on the 2004 series of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here.</p>
      <p>Peter found love again, this time with medic Emily MacDonagh.</p>
