      <p>American Airlines’ explanation its diversion of a transatlantic flight from London was due to odour from a spilled cleaning product has been questioned.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-50461302">The BBC claims</a> it has seen documents showing the Airbus A330 aircraft was leaking oil before the flight from Heathrow to Philadelphia on October 21.</p>
      <p>The incident onboard AA Flight 729 saw two crew members ‘lose consciousness’ and one passenger was taken to hospital after the plane was diverted to Dublin.</p>
      <p>Sources told the BBC it was likely the leak led to toxic fumes entering the cabin but this has been denied by American Airlines.</p>
      <p>At the time it said the incident was ‘due to an odour caused by a spilt cleaning solution in the galley’.</p>
      <p>The denial has failed to quash doubts over what happened on the flight, with a source from the airline adding it was ‘inconceivable’ a cleaning product approved for use on a plane would cause people to pass out.</p>

      <p>The BBC reported an oil leak in the plane’s auxiliary power unit (APU) was discovered days before the incident, and a noxious odour resulting in ‘eye and throat irritation’ was recorded on the same aircraft shortly after the diverted flight.</p>

      <p>American Airlines said in a statement the APU was out of service at the time of the flight, but the BBC cited an Airbus document entitled ‘APU bleed air oil contamination’ which warns an oil smell or smoke in the cabin can be caused by ‘APU oil contamination’, even when the device is not running.</p>
      <p>The plane was eventually flown back to Philadelphia with no passengers on board and no further odours were reported, the airline said.</p>

      <p>America Airlines said in a statement: ‘Cabin odours are a priority for American’s leadership team at the highest level of the organisation.</p>
      <p>‘We will continue to apply our industry leading techniques and monitor all scientific, engineering and medical resources available.</p>
      <p>‘It cannot be emphasised enough that the health and welfare of our crews and customers continues to be our top priority.</p>
      <p>‘However, in the case of this aircraft and the diversion to Dublin, there is no connection to the APU or bleed air from the APU.’</p>
