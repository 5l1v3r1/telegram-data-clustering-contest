      <p>Following multiple reports in regard to what‚Äôs next alongside the Chiron, the Volkswagen Group-owned brand is reconsidering a four-seater model <i>‚Äúfor less than $1 million.‚Äù </i>Chief executive officer Stephan Winkelmann is currently trying to convince the big shots on the board to fund the project, and as expected, Bugatti is making a case for all-electric drive.</p>
      <p><i>‚ÄúHold on; doesn‚Äôt that mean Bugatti wants to get valuable know-how from the Porsche Taycan and that Audi What‚Äôs-Its-Name electric thingy?‚Äù </i>In a nutshell, that appears to be the case. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-18/bugatti-plots-electric-four-seater-for-less-than-1-million">Bloomberg</a>¬†reports about the possibility of<i> ‚Äúa crossover,‚Äù </i>yet Winkelmann told the motoring media time and again that no utility vehicle will happen under his watch.</p>
      <p>As the pinnacle of the Volkswagen Group, the brand that‚Äôs known for engineering extravagances such as the quad-turbo W16 in the Veyron and Chiron needs to wow the public with the second model line. A re-bodied and re-badged Porsche Taycan will not suffice. Bugatti is <i>‚Äúearning decent money‚Äù</i> according to Winkelmann, yet the R&amp;D funds are too low to support such a project without the help of the group by means of inter-brand synergies.</p>
      <p>Another problem of going electric with a more mass-market product is output. The production plant in Molsheim currently produces approximately 100 cars every year, a volume that wouldn‚Äôt be enough for the yet-to-be-confirmed model in order for Bugatti to break even or profit.</p>
      <p><i>‚ÄúThe industry is changing fundamentally, and we have to address what opportunities there are to develop Bugatti as a brand going forward,‚Äù</i> added the head honcho. On that note, wanna bet a tenner that the electric <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/bugatti-s-four-door-model-is-still-under-consideration-105291.html">four-door sedan</a> will become the best-selling Bugatti ever?</p>
      <p>For an automaker that‚Äôs always been specialized in limited runs of extremely special cars, this change would make Ettore turn in his grave. On the other hand, a cheaper product rolled out in greater numbers would work wonders for the company's financial situation and its stand in the <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/auto-glossary/e.html#ge-electric-vehicle"><u>EV</u></a> landscape. üèÅ</p>
