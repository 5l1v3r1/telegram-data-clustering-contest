      <p><b>STOCKHOLMÂ (AP)</b> - The alleged rape investigation involving WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is currently in prison in Britain, has been discontinued, a Swedish prosecutor said Tuesday.</p>
      <p>"I want to inform about my decision to discontinue the preliminary investigation," Deputy Chief Prosecutor Eva-Marie Persson told a news conference.</p>
      <p>Kristinn Hrafnsson, WikiLeaks editor-in-chief, said in a tweet that the focus should now move onto the "threat" that Assange has been "warning about for years: the belligerent prosecution of the United States and the threat it poses to the First Amendment."</p>
      <p>Tuesday's decision follows a ruling in June by a Swedish court that Assange should not be detained.</p>
      <p>Two months earlier, Assange was evicted from the Ecuador Embassy in London where he had been holed up since 2012. He was immediately arrested and is currently serving a 50-week sentence in Britain for jumping bail in 2012.</p>
      <p>He is also fighting extradition to the U.S., which accuses him of publishing secret documents.</p>
