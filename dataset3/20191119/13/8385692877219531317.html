      <p><a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/sony">Sony</a>'s alleged 2020 device <a href="https://androidnext.info/?p=424#toc5">roadmap leaked</a>, and it suggests that the company will announce four flagships. On top of that, this roadmap suggests that the company will introduce three mid-rangers next year.</p>
      <p>Do note that this information does not come from the usual source, so take it with a grain of salt. Having said that, it's not really surprising we'll see only three mid-rangers from the company next year. Sony decided to focus more on the premium end of the specter a while back.</p>
      <h3>Sony's leaked roadmap for 2020 suggests 4 flagships are coming, including the mysterious Xperia 0</h3>
      <p>That is not all that Sony's roadmap for 2020 revealed, as some specific info leaked. The source mentions four flagship models with the following names: Xperia 1.1, Xperia 3, Xperia 5.1, and Xperia 0.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>Now, the source did not get specific info regarding each of those devices, but it ventured to guess what each of them represents. The Xperia 1.1 could be a successor to the company's global flagship that arrived in 2019, the Xperia 1.</p>
      <p>The Xperia 3 could be a DoCoMo exclusive model, while the Xperia 5.1 will obviously succeed the Xperia 5. The Sony Xperia 5, for those of you who do not know, is Sony's compact flagship for 2019.</p>
      <p>Now, the Xperia 0 is a real mystery here. The source does guess this could be the true premium Sony phone for 2020. Back in June, some info surfaced, suggesting an unknown Sony flagship will sport a hexa-camera setup on the back.</p>

      <p>Well, this could be the Xperia 0 handset that the source mentions. That leak in June also suggested that the phone will include 20-megapixel (f/2.4, 16mm), 48-megapixel (f/1.2-2.4, 26mm), 16-megapixel (f/2.4, 52mm), 8-megapixel (f/2.4, 135mm), 12-megapixel (f/1.2-2.4, 26mm), and 0.5-megapixel (ToF) cameras on the back. On top of that, it mentioned that it will include 10-megapixel and 0.3-megapixel front-facing cameras.</p>
      <p>As far as the design is concerned, that device is expected to resemble the Xperia 1. The thing is, it may include a thinner "forehead" than the Xperia 1.</p>
      <p>The phone will probably be made out of metal, and it will have a tall display aspect ratio. If we had to guess, we'd say that it will sport a 21:9 aspect ratio, just like the Xperia 1 and 5.</p>

      <h3>All Sony-branded 2020 flagships are expected to ship with the Snapdragon 865</h3>
      <p>All Sony flagships in 2020 are expected to include the Snapdragon 865. That SoC has not been announced just yet, but Qualcomm is expected to announce it in the near future.</p>
      <p>The Xperia 5.1 is expected to be quite similar to the Xperia 1.1 in the spec department, but it will be a more compact device, that's for sure.</p>
      <p>As far as mid-rangers are concerned, the Xperia 10.1, 9.1, and 8.1 have been mentioned by the source. The source also notes that those three devices will all include 5G connectivity, or come in 5G variants. That is pretty much it. As already mentioned, take this info with a grain of salt.</p>
