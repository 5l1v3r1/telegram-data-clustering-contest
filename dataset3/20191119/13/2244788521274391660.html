        <b>THE Nigerian Army said it has recovered gun trucks, anti-aircraft guns, ammunitions among other items from Boko Haram fighters in a failed ambush by the insurgents.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In a statement by  the army authorities signed by Aminu Iliyasu, the Nigerian Army Operations Media Coordinator, the troops of 153 Task Force Battalion during a fighting patrol on Monday were ambushed by Boko Haram insurgents along Ala Village, in Dikwa local government of Borno State.</p>
      <p>He said the patrolling army troop were able to turn the ambush around as they engaged in a firefight with the terrorist who eventually flee abandoning their weapons and food supplies.</p>
      <p>The troops embarked on a pursuit of the fleeing insurgents who abandoned two gun trucks, two anti-aircraft guns, 2,080 Rounds of 7.62mm NATO ammunition, 26 Rounds of 12.7 mm armour-piercing incendiary ammunition, he said.</p>

      <p>According to him, the troop was also able to recover three AK 47 Rifles, six rounds of 12.7 mm (Belted), one AOJOE motorcycle including some clothes, food supplies and mechanical tools.</p>
      <p>He said most of the Boko Haram members were believed to have escaped with varying degrees of gunshot wounds.</p>
      <p>“The Chief of Army Staff, Lieutenant General Tukur Yusufu Buratai commends the troops for their gallantry, and equally wishes to reiterate the commitment of the Nigerian Army to accomplish its constitutional mandate professionally and responsively for a secured Nigeria,” he wrote.</p>
      <p>He expressed the appreciation of COAS to well-meaning Nigerians for their unalloyed support, goodwill and understanding towards officers and men of the Nigerian Army as they tackle multiple security challenges confronting the nation.</p>
      <p>He added that less than two weeks ago, Boko Haram suffered a tactical boomerang when some of them were neutralised and maimed as they mistakenly stepped on the same improvised explosive device that they had earlier planted.</p>
