      <h1>Government halting key part of robo-debt scheme to recover debts from welfare recipients</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:00:48+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/paul-farrell/" target="_blank">Paul Farrell</a></address>
      <p>The federal government is immediately halting a key part of the controversial robo-debt scheme to recover debts from welfare recipients and will freeze some existing debts, in what appears to be a major backdown in the operation of the scheme.</p>
      <p>In an urgent email circulated to all Department of Human Services compliance staff today, seen by <i>7.30</i>, the general manager of the debt appeal division wrote:</p>
      <p>“The department has made the decision to require additional proof when using income averaging to identity over payments.</p>
      <p>“This means the department will no longer raise a debt where the only information we are relying on is our own averaging of Australia Taxation Office income data.”</p>
      <p>The averaging process has <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/national/2019/10/24/dead-people-robodebt/">long been one of the most controversial parts of the scheme</a>.</p>
      <p>Legal groups have said that it causes inaccuracies in the debt amounts, and wrongly shifts the burden of proof onto alleged debtors.</p>
      <p>The email also sets out that the department would undertake a sweeping review of all debts where averaging was used.</p>
      <p>“Customer compliance division will methodically work through previous debts identified as part of the online compliance program and respond to their requests for clarification,” it said.</p>
      <p>The department will also be writing to affected customers.</p>
      <p>“For customers who are affected, the department will freeze debt recovery action as CCD identifies them and looks at each debt. The department will also write to affected customers to let them know,” the email said.</p>
      <p><i>7.30</i> has contacted the Minister for Government Services and the Department of Human Services for a response.</p>
