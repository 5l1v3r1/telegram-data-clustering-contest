      <h2>A midlife crisis?</h2>

      <p>Fans are begging <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/this-morning/">This Morning</a>'s Gino D'Acampo to ditch his new rock 'n' roll style and stop wearing a bandana.</p>
      <p>The Celebrity Juice star, 43, debuted his dramatically different new look on the daytime programme earlier this month and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/this-morning/this-morning-fans-in-stitches-as-phil-schofield-mocks-gino-dacampos-new-look/">some viewers wondered if he was going through a midlife crisis</a>.</p>
      <p>On today's (19.11.19) episode of the show, Gino hosted a cookery segment and again wore a bandana.</p>

      </p>
      <p>At the start of the segment, hosts <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/holly-willoughby/">Holly Willoughby</a> and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/phillip-schofield/">Phillip Schofield</a> asked the Italian culinary whiz about his new cookbook.</p>
      <p>Holly said: "This is Gino's Italian Express. You just said this is your favourite cook book yet?"</p>
      <p>He replied, as he added oil to a pan: "This is my favourite book that I wrote so far. I personally tested each recipe three times to make sure that everything works to perfection, to the minute, each gram of every ingredient, and it's just fantastic."</p>

      <p>But it appears viewers were still more interested in what Gino was wearing than what he had to say about cooking.</p>
      <p>On Twitter, a number of fans begged Gino to stop wearing bandanas.</p>
      <aside>Why does Gino still have that damn bandana?</aside>
      <p>One said: "Please take the silly bandana off, Gino! #ThisMorning."</p>
      <p>Another tweeted: "I think Gino is great. Funny, entertaining and a great chef. But please tell him to lose the bandana. Regards, a fan."</p>
      <p>A third said: "Whoever told Gino that bandana looks good deserves a gold star. [bleep] #Thismorning."</p>

      <p>Someone else wrote: "Why does Gino still have that damn bandana? #ThisMorning."</p>
      <p>"Watching This Morning, does Gino know what a [bleep] he looks with that bandana on his head?" said a fifth.</p>
      <p>"Gino, lose the bandana #FreeTheFronte," tweeted another.</p>

      </p>
      <p>It seems Holly and Phil also think Gino's new style is a bit silly.</p>
      <p>The pair poked fun at the chef by wearing bandanas of their own during a cooking segment last week.</p>
      <p>Holly <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/this-morning/holly-willoughby-and-phillip-schofield-make-fun-of-chef-gino-dacampos-new-look/">struggled to keep a smile off her face as they approached the kitchen</a> and Phil asked: "So, is what you've got on your head now, this is a new essential, is it?"</p>
