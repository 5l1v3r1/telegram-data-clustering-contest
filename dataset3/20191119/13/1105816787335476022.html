      <p><b>BANNU: </b>Launching a fresh attack on the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government following ‘Azadi March’ sit-in in Islamabad, Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Tuesday said the government did not have a leg to stand on and its days are now numbered.</p>
      <p>Addressing a party gathering, he said the incumbent rulers had no ideology of their own and they did not have anything but expletives for their opponents. “They cannot be allowed to rule by stealing votes… we have come out for Pakistan’s democracy and to shield its Constitution,” he remarked.</p>
      <p>Rebuffing the notion that ‘Azadi March’ had failed to yield desired results, Maulana Fazl said the government’s roots were cut and its days are numbered due to his party’s protest movement. “We did not go to Islamabad without any reason nor have we returned empty-handed,” he added.</p>
      <p>The JUI-F chief said Prime Minister Imran Khan’s ‘corruption rhetoric’ had failed as people within the ruling party were seeking the premier’s personal accountability.</p>

      <p>Responding to PM Imran’s fiery speech from Monday, the firebrand cleric said he was ready to face off the former in the field. “Come out and compare your character with mine and your father and grandfather’s with my elders,” he challenged the prime minister.</p>
      <p>Maulana Fazl said fresh elections were the only way out of current crises facing the country.</p>
      <p>The premier, who inaugurated 39.3km Havelian-Mansehra section of the 118-km-long HavelianThakot motorway on Monday, used his speech at the ceremony to speak his mind out on two issues — Azadi March and former prime minister Nawaz Sharif’s illness — which remained the talking points on the media since last month.</p>
      <p>He accused the Maulana of duping “innocent madrassah students” into joining the ‘Azadi March’ and using the “religion card” for “petting political gains”.</p>
      <p>The prime minister also called the dharna marriage of interests where self-styled liberals stood shoulder to shoulder with conservatives and Islamists.</p>
