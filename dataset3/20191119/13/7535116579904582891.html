      <p>An 80-year-old man who went to a chiropractor to get treatment for his leg injury died after the chiropractor broke his neck.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7698089/Chiropractor-fatally-broke-80-year-old-ex-bank-managers-neck-blasted-family-inquest.html?ito=social-facebook&amp;fbclid=IwAR2__uMgl-u_tJzQZX9ENnxwHOxvLN_KKtYiACrZMfxrpc8MfwxPDpjlqcE">Daily Mail</a>, John Lawler died from respiratory depression after suffering â€˜irreversibleâ€™ spinal damage which left him a quadriplegic â€“ a person paralysed in all four limbs.</p>

      <p>The incident happened in the UK where Johnâ€™s neck was â€˜snapped like a rigid stickâ€™ on chiropractor Dr Arleenâ€™s treatment table. However, a condition that John had at the time contributed to this tragic accident.</p>
      <p>Because of his old age, John was suffering from a calcifying condition, which meant that his spine was much more rigid than usual. Therefore, going for the chiropractic treatment meant that <b>his back was bent like a spoon backwards and forwards until it broke in two.Â </b></p>
      <p>Johnâ€™s family are now calling for action against the General Chiropractic Council to consider first aid training for chiropractors and to implement pre-treatment imaging, such as x-rays and other scans to ensure that patients are fit for chiropractic treatments.</p>

      <p>The family has also called for measures to prevent chiropractors from calling themselves â€˜doctorsâ€™.</p>
      <p>Investigations revealed that the chiropractor had not asked for any x-rays or images of the manâ€™s condition before the treatment, which could have detected the condition that made him unfit for it.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Well, chiropractic treatments are unlikely to kill you if done professionally, but if you have a pre-existing condition like this elderly man did, itâ€™s better to get yourself checked to see if you are fit for such a treatment before proceeding with it.Â </i>
