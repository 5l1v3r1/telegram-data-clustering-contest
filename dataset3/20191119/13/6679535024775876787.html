      <h1>Defamation case: Special court issues production warrant against Lalu Prasad</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:17:51+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Amarnath-Tewary-769/" target="_blank">Amarnath Tewary</a></address>
      <p>A special court in Patna has issued a production warrant against Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu Prasad in a defamation case. Mr. Prasad, who has been serving prison time following his conviction in several fodder scam cases, is currently receiving medical attention in a government hospital in Ranchi.</p>
      <p>Judge Kumar Abhinav issued the production warrant on Monday in connection with a case filed by a retired official Uday Kant Mishra, who has charged Mr. Prasad with allegedly making objectionable comments against him and his family during a political rally at Bhagalpur in 2017.</p>
      <p>The court directed the Birsa Munda jail authorities in Ranchi to produce Mr. Prasad before the court on December 2, which is the next date of hearing in the case.</p>
      <p>Earlier, Mr. Prasad could not be produced before the court through video-conferencing. “So, the court issued fresh production warrant against him in the case,” said Mr. Mishra’s counsel V.S. Dubey.</p>
      <p>Mr. Prasad, who is officially lodged in the Birsa Munda central jail in Ranchi, has been admitted at the government-run Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) for more than a year now.</p>
      <p>In 2017, during a public rally of the RJD in Bhagalpur, Mr. Prasad had allegedly made some objectionable comments against Mr. Mishra and is reported to have cited the former official’s name in connection to the multi-crore Srijan scam. The CBI is investigating the Srijan scam, which relates to fraudulent siphoning off of government money into the account of a Bhagalpur-based NGO.</p>
