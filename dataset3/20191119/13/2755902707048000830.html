      <p>The Chinese Embassy in Zimbabwe has disputed the figures of aid they donated to Zimbabwe which were given out by Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube during the 2020 National Budget presentation last week.</p>
      <p>According to Mthuli Ncube, the Chinese donated only US$3.6 million. This figure pales in comparison to the US$50 donated by the United State government, the US$50 million donated by the United Kingdom, the US$41 million donated by the European Union and the US$28 million donated by Sweden.</p>
      <p>Unsurprisingly the Chinese were not happy about these figures and insisted that there was a shortfall of more than US$133 million. According to the Chinese Embassy, the bilateral aid to Zimbabwe stands at US$136.8m and not US$3.6 million…….</p>
      <p>………………The Embassy of the People’s Republic of China in Zimbabwe has taken note of the release of 2020 National Budget Statement by the Zimbabwean government. The Embassy appreciates the positive role the budget will play in promoting the policies and propagating the facts and figures related to the economic development of the country.</p>
