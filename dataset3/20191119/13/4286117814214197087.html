      <h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Jio says it would be looking at increasing prices of its service in the upcoming days.</li>
        <li>Jio recently started charging its customers 6 paise per minute for all outgoing calls to other networks.</li>
        <li>Airtel and Vodafone announced increase in prices of their services recently.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Jio has announced that it will be looking at increasing prices of its services. The Jio price increase announcement comes a day after Airtel and Vodafone announced something similar. While Vodafone said that it would be increasing prices of its service from December 1, Airtel didn't give any specific date. Instead, Airtel said that it would be increasing its prices from December.</p>
      <p>"As per media reports, we understand that TRAI is likely to initiate a consultation process for revision of telecom tariffs. Like other operators, we will also work with the Government and comply with the regulatory regime to strengthen the industry to benefit Indian consumers and take measures including appropriate increase in tariffs in next few weeks in a manner that does not adversely impact data consumption or growth in digital adoption and sustains investments," Jio said in a statement.</p>
      <p>None of the telecom operators has specified which services will see a price increase, but it is safe to assume that prices of all postpaid, prepaid telecom plans, including calls and data plans, will go up. In the case of Airtel and Jio, prices of the broadband services may also go up. The telecom companies have also not announced any details regarding the amount of price increase but relatively it not likely to be very steep. Currently, the call and data charges in India are among the lowest in the world and even after the price increase they are likely to remain the lowest.</p>
      <p>When Jio increases the prices of its postpaid and prepaid plans, this will be the second time in recent months that Jio consumers will be paying increased rates. Recently, the company started charging 10 paise per minute for cellular calls as it is paying that money towards the "interconnection charges". There are deliberations by TRAI to do away with interconnection charges but for now, they need to be paid.</p>
      <p>The Indian telecom industry is going through big changes. After Jio entered the market, the price of data and calls has fallen significantly. The intense competition has put pressure on all telecom companies. recently, Vodafone and Airtel have been hit by AGR dues -- around Rs 80,000 crore for the two companies -- that they have to pay to the government. Vodafone has argued that due to AGR dues its business in India has become nonviable, a sentiment shared by Airtel that too may find it incredibly hard to raise money to pay AGR dues. Both companies have reportedly sought concessions from the government.</p>
