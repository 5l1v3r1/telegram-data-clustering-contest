      <p>Add Maths is the bane of existence of every SPM taker ever, and we believe that no other subject will take this top spot.</p>

      <p>However, this year’s Add Maths SPM paper has come under fire. It is said that the questions for Add Maths papers were so hard that a lot of students came out of the exam hall crying.</p>
      <p>According to<a href="https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2019/11/19/even-teachers-struggling-with-add-maths-exam-questions"> The Star</a>, an add maths teacher who has been teaching for a long time now had difficulties trying to solve questions from the recent paper, and he said that the standards for the papers are even harder than the Singaporean O-Levels.</p>
      <blockquote>“I spent an hour and only managed to finish 2 questions. Most Add Maths teachers (in the country) will struggle with those questions, which are harder than Singapore’s.”<br/>“It was definitely very challenging for students to finish 12 questions in two-and-a-half hours.”</blockquote>
      <p>The teacher has taken to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/maths.video/posts/2995161810497388">Facebook</a> to voice out his concerns on his Add Maths tutorial page. He adds that it’s a very good thing that the ministry is adding in more questions that require High Order Thinking Skills (HOTS), but only if the teachers and students are trained for it. He mentioned that some of the questions could be found in Malaysian educational materials, but only in the STPM syllabus.</p>
      <blockquote>“A lot of students told me that they were able to complete only half the paper.”</blockquote>
      <p>He also said that by making papers tough, it will in turn cause students to lose interest in add maths, which will affect their career pathways. For example, Add Maths in A-Levels is needed to pursue medicine, pharmacy, psychology and more.</p>

      <p>Many students expressed their disappointment as well:</p>
      <p>Delilah, who was consistently among the top 10 students in the whole of her form, also struggled with both the papers.</p>
      <p>Another student who was aiming to get straight A’s so she could get a scholarship to further her studies said,</p>
      <blockquote>“Add Maths broke me.”</blockquote>
      <p>The chairman of the Melaka Action Group for Parents in Education (Magpie) Mak Chee Kin, said that including questions that are from the STPM syllabus into the SPM is unfair to the students and the Examinations Syndicate officers should be fired for that. He added that apologies are not enough because this concerns the futures of countless students all over Malaysia.</p>
      <p>These are a few of the questions that appeared on the papers.</p>
