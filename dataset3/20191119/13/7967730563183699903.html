      <h1>Battlelines drawn over Australia's hydrogen 'fork in the road'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author">Peter Hannam and Mike Foley</a></address>
      <p>A potential stoush is brewing over the future source of energy to power Australia's prospective hydrogen exports, with several states lining up to support renewables over coal at this Friday's energy ministers summit in Perth.</p>
      <p>Chief Scientist Alan Finkel will kick off the COAG energy council meeting - the only such gathering in 2019 - with a presentation on Australia's National Hydrogen Strategy, according to a copy of the agenda obtained by <i>The Sydney Morning Herald</i> and <i>The Age</i>.</p>

      <p>Labor-led governments in Queensland, Western Australia and the ACT plan to stress the importance of tapping renewable energy sources to produce so-called "green hydrogen" fuel to meet expected large and expanding demand as trading partners cut greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
      <p>Coal, though, is another source of energy, and the production of "brown hydrogen" could shore up that industry.</p>
      <p>"There are enormous opportunities for Australia to position itself as an energy export super power," Shane Rattenbury, ACT's energy minister, said, adding the decision amounts to "a fork in the road".</p>

      <p>"Anyone willing to invest in this industry will want a payback lasting decades," he said. "We could see [the promotion of hydrogen] as an attempt to prop up the coal industry."</p>
      <p>Federal Energy Minister Angus Taylor, who will chair Friday's meeting, did not respond to a request for comment before deadline.</p>
      <p>In August, Mr Taylor said the Morrison government had invested more than $100 million in hydrogen projects and global annual demand may jump 35-fold over the next two decades from about 1 million tonnes today.</p>

      <p>WA Energy Minister Bill Johnson said the McGowen government had earmarked $10 million this year to position his state to become a major exporter of renewable hydrogen.</p>
      <p>“Western Australia has vast renewable energy sources including solar and wind, extensive land mass, a strong existing energy export sector and proximity to Asia," he said.</p>
      <p>“Key markets such as Japan and Korea have signalled a shift towards low-emissions hydrogen for the future."</p>
      <p>A spokeswoman for Cameron Dick, Queensland's Minister for State Development, said the state "views green hydrogen as the long-term future for energy production".</p>
      <p>"Queensland has all the pre-requisites needed to support a renewable hydrogen industry including solar, wind and biomass, a pro-business government, existing gas pipeline infrastructure, and first-class export facilities, and we’re eager to take advantage of our position," she said, noting the government will host a forum on hydrogen in Townsville on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Victoria's position is less clear. Energy Minister Lily D'Ambrosio said "clean hydrogen can provide significant benefits across our economy and could play a key role in achieving our emissions reduction targets".</p>
      <p>"Our exploration of the potential of hydrogen is just one example of our leadership in transitioning the state to a cleaner energy future," she said.</p>
      <p>However, the government is also supporting the use of Latrobe Valley brown coal to produce hydrogen gas as part of the world-first Hydrogen Energy Supply Chain (HESC) pilot. Work started this month on an export facility.</p>
      <p>NSW Energy Minister Matt Kean said hydrogen had "the potential to transform our economy and energy mix".</p>
      <p>"A low-emissions hydrogen industry could create new jobs, increase fuel and energy security and attract green investment in NSW," he said.</p>
