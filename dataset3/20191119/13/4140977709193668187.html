          </p>
          <p>Although they are currently sitting in the echelons of the league standings with the 14 points, Brisbane Heat know that they are far from safe in their top spot. The side are constantly pushed by their counterparts with just four points separating first and fifth place with the Renegades having played an additional match over everyone else.</p>
          <p>And one such team who is challenging them for a spot in the pinnacles of the standings is Melbourne Renegades with a win for them helping close down the deficit between the two teams to just two points. The side are coming into today’s encounter having prevailed by two wickets in an edge of the seat thriller against Sydney Sixers, a match which saw the side pull off a win of the very last ball.</p>

                <p>Needing 140 to win, Melbourne Renegades were guilty of making things way too jittery than they should have been with wickets at regular intervals constantly pushing them back in their quest off pulling off a win. However, the team managed to show composure right in the end to carry immense momentum into today’s encounter against the league leaders.</p>
                <p>Brisbane Heat meanwhile pulled off an extremely clinical and comprehensive win over Perth Scorchers in their most recent outing in the league, an 8 wicket win which perfectly epitomised the behemoth nature of this side. In what was a complete display by them to first curb their opponents to just 112 before cruising to a win with 23 balls to spare, the side showcased their credentials for the league title, a result they’ll be looking to emanate come today as well.</p>

                      <h3>Pitch Conditions And Toss</h3>
                      <p>Relatively a good surface to bat on, the figure of the side chasing winning on 5 out of 6 occasions perfectly points towards just how good a batting track this is. The team winning the toss will be looking to come out chase again today with a cohesive idea of how to subject themselves in their pursuit of the target at hand.</p>

                            <h3>MR-W vs BH-W Dream11 Wicket-Keeper</h3>
                            <p>Unbeaten on 60 in 44 balls in the side’s last encounter, the fulcrum of her side’s batting unit, wicket-keeper and opener Beth Mooney played out a match winning knock for her side. The player has been the team’s highest scorer this edition, a name who has revelled us in pristine and sublime displays on a consistent basis.</p>
                            <h3>MR-W vs BH-W Dream11 Batswomen</h3>
                            <p>Her counterpart Maddy Green comes in as well to partner her in for this one whilst from the other side we are moving in with Courtney Webb as our first pick. Her 34 runs in the last encounter were integral to the side scripting a win in their favour, a knock which came at a time when the side were shambolically collapsing and losing their way.</p>
                            <p>Melbourne Renegades will also be represented by Laura Harris, a player who has grown in reverence across the cricketing fraternity for her fortitude and resolve.</p>
                            <h3>MR-W vs BH-W Dream11 All-Rounders</h3>
                            <p>Keeping things levelly balanced in this docket of our Dream 11 component, we have the two players apiece from either side compose the all-rounders’ facet. We begin with the pick from the league leaders with Jess Jonassen being an immediate pick for us after he remained unbeaten on 32 runs in the foregone outing to string together a match winning stand of 81 for the second wicket.</p>
                            <p>Sammy Jo-Johnson got the two wickets to her name in the same match, sending down a restrictive spell of 2-16 with the ball to send her opponent’s skittling for a meagre score. From Brisbane Heat elsewhere we are selecting Danielle Wyatt after the opener cantered her way to 55 runs in the previous match. All-rounder and her partner in the opening slot, Sophie Molineux will also be making an advent into our unit from the side.</p>
                            <h3>MR-W vs BH-W Dream11 Bowling Order</h3>
                            <p>We have a duo representing us from Brisbane Heat with heir new ball quick Delissa Kimmince being the first name to be serenaded down our side. The player returned with figures of 1-26 in the last encounter, getting massive deviation and movement on the ball to send it down the right channels and leave the bats flummoxed.</p>
                            <p>Someone who has allowed her to take wickets at regular intervals is Georgia Prestwidge with the player giving away just 13 runs in 4 overs the last time around while from the opposition we have decided to divulge in the lone selection of Maitlan Brown.</p>
                            <h3>Captain And Vice-Captain</h3>
                            <p>The same picks yet again for us in a match involving Brisbane Heat with Jonassen our captain for the day while Mooney will be our vice-captain.</p>
