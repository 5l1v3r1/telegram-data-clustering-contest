      <h2>Several Opposition leaders take part</h2>

      <p>Even as the stalemate over the nearly one-and-a-half month old indefinite TSRTC strike continued, the agitated employees took out a silent rally here on Tuesday as a mark of protest against the State governmentâ€™s alleged continued indifference towards their strike.</p>
      <p>The demonstrators covered their mouths with black ribbons as a sign of resentment.</p>
      <p>Several local leaders of CPI (M), CPI and CPI (ML-ND), Congress, BJP and other Opposition parties also took part in the rally that culminated in a demonstration at the bus stand.</p>
      <p>Addressing the demonstration, the leaders of the Opposition parties slammed the State government charging it with remaining apathetic to the agony of more than 48,000 striking TSRTC employees and their ongoing indefinite strike for just demands since October 5.</p>
      <p>They demanded that the ruling dispensation hold talks with the TSRTC-JAC leaders to fulfil the demands of the striking employees and save the public transport entity in larger public interest.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, some RTC employees organised protests in Kothagudem and various other parts of Bhadradri-Kothagudem district on the 46th day of the transport strike on Tuesday.</p>
