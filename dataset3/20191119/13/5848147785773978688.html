      <h1>Government halting key part of robo-debt scheme to recover debts from welfare recipients</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:00:48+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/paul-farrell/" target="_blank">Paul Farrell</a></address>
      <p>The federal government is immediately halting a key part of the controversial robo-debt scheme, and will freeze some existing debts in what appears to be a major backdown in the operation of the scheme.</p>
      <p>In an urgent email circulated to all Department of Human Services compliance staff on Tuesday, seen by the ABC’s <i>7.30</i>, the general manager of the debt appeal division wrote that: “The department has made the decision to require additional proof when using income averaging to identity over payments”.</p>
      <p>“This means the department will no longer raise a debt where the only information we are relying on is our own averaging of Australia Taxation Office income data.”</p>
      <p>The averaging process has long been one of the most controversial parts of the scheme, which <a href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/national/2019/10/24/dead-people-robodebt/">matches income data from the ATO with income reported to Centrelink</a> by welfare recipients.</p>
      <p>Legal groups have said averaging causes inaccuracies in the debt amounts, and wrongly shifts the burden of proof onto alleged debtors.</p>
      <h3>All averaging debt judgments under review</h3>
      <p>The email also said the department would undertake a sweeping review of all debts where averaging was used.</p>
      <p>“Customer compliance division will methodically work through previous debts identified as part of the online compliance program and respond to their requests for clarification,” it said.</p>
      <p>The department will also write to affected customers.</p>
      <p>“For customers who are affected, the department will freeze debt recovery action as CCD [Customer Compliance Division] identifies them and looks at each debt. The department will also write to affected customers to let them know,” the email said.</p>
      <p>Automated Centrelink debts, described by critics as robo-debts, have been criticised by legal groups because they require welfare recipients to prove they do not owe any money.</p>
      <p>If a discrepancy is detected, people are usually sent a letter asking for further information such as payslips and bank statements, sometimes from years earlier.</p>
      <p>Stuart Robert, the Minister for Government Services, said: “This program has been refined a number of times over the years. This is a further refinement this morning”.</p>
      <p>“It’s important for Australians to understand they don’t need to contact the department. That small cohort of Australians that have a debt crystallised solely on income averaging, my department will reach out and contact them over the coming weeks.</p>
      <p>“We’ll continue to use income averaging, with other proof points, as the basis to identify the possibility of a debt. The key refinement is that income averaging, plus proof points, will be used to crystallise or finalise the debt.”</p>
