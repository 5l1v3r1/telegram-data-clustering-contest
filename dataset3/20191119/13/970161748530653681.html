      <p>It’s important for a bride to make an entrance on her wedding day.</p>
      <p>That might mean rocking up in a vintage car, a horse and carriage, or even making the groom sweat by arriving 30-minutes late.</p>
      <p>But this bride took that concept to the next level after she hitched a ride to her wedding in a firetruck after her wedding limo got stuck in standstill traffic.</p>

      <p>Julie Gorman, who lives in LA, almost missed her own nuptials after a car crash left her limo stuck in traffic and stranded her and her bridesmaids on the side of the road.</p>
      <p>Los Angeles County firefighters from Station 69 were at the scene of a car accident that blocked both lanes of Topanga Canyon Boulevard when they spotted Julie and her maids by the road, holding up their dresses to keep them out of the mud.</p>
