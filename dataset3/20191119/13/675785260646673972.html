      <p> </p>
      <p>Others quizzed: "What’s your view on those who think Miss World is an outdated institution?" and "Miss world???? Really???"</p>
      <p>Some loyal fans were happy for the TV personality, as they offered: "A prince among queens.good luck you will be amazing" and "Whaooooo you are the perfect one to host this xx."</p>
      <p>It comes as <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/peter-andre-dances-thriller-after-20790584">Peter has been forced to defend himself for playing the late Michael Jackson in a controversial musical</a> about him.</p>
      <p>He received criticism for accepting the role due to the claims about Jackson molesting children during his career.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, a documentary called Leaving Neverland alleged that Jackson sexually abused Wade Robson and James Safechuck when they were children.</p>
      <p>The powerful documentary left a lot of Jackson fans feeling like they could no longer listen to his music.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>But speaking on Good Morning Britain, Peter insisted the musical was just "about the music".</p>
      <p>He said: "I have always said that we've got to keep the music separate.</p>
      <p>"The reason I say that, one is because if you're going to go there and say you can't listen to the music because there's allegations, do you listen to the music pre any supposed allegations, where do you go with it?</p>
      <p>Someone was listening to  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/rihanna">Rihanna</a>  the other day and there was a sample of a Michael Jackson song, and she was telling me she was unsure about listening to Michael Jackson.</p>
      <p>"So where do you draw that line?’"</p>

      <p>He added: "This show is about the music. I always have to say that they are allegations.</p>
      <p>"It doesn't mean there's no truth in it or you can in any way ignore it.</p>
      <p>"But we're not at that point where we know what happened."</p>
      <p>Jackson's estate have denied the claims against the singer, who died in 2009.</p>
