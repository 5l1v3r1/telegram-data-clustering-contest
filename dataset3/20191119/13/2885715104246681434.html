      <p>With gold and diamond jewellery being the go to choice when it comes to wedding accessories, a Pakistani bride decided to pair her wedding attire with tomatoes. As bizarre as it may sound, a video of a television channel interviewing the bride has gone viral on social media, leaving many amused.</p>
      <p>A clip of the interview was tweeted by Pakistani journalist Naila Inayat along with a caption that read, “Tomato jewellery. In case you thought you’ve seen everything in life.”</p>

      <p>In the 2.20-minute viral clip, the bride is seen flaunting the tomatoes, prices of which have soared over Rs. 300 in Pakistan. “As you know, the cost of gold is extremely high and so are the prices of tomatoes and pine nuts. Hence, I decided to use tomatoes instead of gold,” the bride can be heard saying in the video.</p>
      <p>Viewed over 24 thousand times, the post has been flooded with people reacting to the video. While some found the idea “innovative”, others called the bride the “richest” woman in Pakistan.</p>
