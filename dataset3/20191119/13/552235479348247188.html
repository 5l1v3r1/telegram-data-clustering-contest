      <h2>The League One title contenders sacked Ray McKinnon on Saturday after a stuttering start to the season.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:19:18+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:19</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Bryce, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/liam-bryce/</a></address>
      <p>Falkirk have confirmed the appointment of David McCracken and Lee Miller as their new interim coaching team.</p>
      <p>The former Bairns duo have stepped in to steady the ship following Ray McKinnon's sacking on Saturday, with the search for a full time boss ongoing.</p>
      <p><i><b>Record Sport</b> </i>revealed on Monday how the pair travelled to the Falkirk Stadium for talks with the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/spfl-league-one">League One</a> side.</p>
      <p>And now McCracken and Miller have left Peterhead and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/livingston-fc">Livingston</a> respectively to aid their former club's bid to return to the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/scottish-championship">Championship</a> .</p>
      <p>They will be guided by <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/falkirk-fc">Falkirk</a> legend Alex Totten in an advisory role, with Miller admitting the emotional pull of a return proved too much to turn down.</p>

      <p>He told the club website: “I am delighted to be back home. The opportunity was one I couldn’t refuse given how much the club means to me. I have always had a brilliant relationship with the Falkirk fans and I am itching to get into the dugout on Friday night.</p>
      <p>“David and I know the club extremely well, we know what is expected and we are determined to get a smile back on the faces of the Falkirk fans once again. We need to get results and we will do everything we can to deliver.”</p>
      <p>And McCracken added: “I’ve had some incredible memories here as a player and I am extremely proud to be asked to coach the team with Lee. We all know the potential here and where this club should be, it’s up to us now to get results to help realise that.</p>
      <p>“Coming back feels right, it’s a real buzz to be out on the pitch and around the stadium again. We have the chance to get off to a great start on Friday night and we will do everything we can to ensure the team are fully prepared for the match.”</p>
      <p>Miller and McCracken oversaw their first training session on Tuesday morning and will be in place for Friday's Scottish Cup tie against Linlithgow Rose.</p>
      <p>A 1-1 draw with Dumbarton signalled the end for McKinnon as his side dropped to fourth.</p>
      <p>Fan anger against the former boss had mounted in recent weeks, culminating in supporters being held back by stewards as McKinnon and his players left the pitch at half-time on Saturday.</p>
