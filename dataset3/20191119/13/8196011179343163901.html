      <p>The alleged rape investigation involving WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is now jailed in Britain, has been discontinued, a Swedish prosecutor has said.</p>
      <p>Deputy Chief Prosecutor Eva-Marie Persson spoke on Tuesday as she gave an update on the Swedish case.</p>
      <p>Assange has been in custody since being removed from the Ecuadorian embassy in London where he had initially been granted asylum.</p>
      <p>He had been wanted in Sweden over the rape claims but is also sought by US authorities over his WikiLeaks activities.</p>
      <p>WikiLeaks, meanwhile, has welcomed the decision by the Swedish authorities to drop the investigation.</p>
      <p>Kristinn Hrafnsson, WikiLeaks editor-in-chief, said, “Sweden has dropped its preliminary investigation into Mr Assange for the third time, after reopening it without any new evidence or information.</p>
      <p>“Let us now focus on the threat Mr Assange has been warning about for years: the belligerent prosecution of the United States and the threat it poses to the First Amendment.”</p>
