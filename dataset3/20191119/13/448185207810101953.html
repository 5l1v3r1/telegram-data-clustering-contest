      <p><b>Bangkok</b><b>:</b> India was committed to achieving a $26 billion defense industry by 2025, said Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, here on Monday.</p>
      <p>Addressing a business seminar ‘India Rising’, organized by the Indian Chamber of Commerce at the Defence &amp; Security Exhibition 2019, he exhorted defense manufacturing companies to join the ‘Make in India’ initiative.</p>
      <p>Under the Draft Defence Production Policy 2018, the Indian government eyes $5 billion in defence exports by 2025. “On the one hand this target is ambitious, but at the same time it’s encouraging that India’s defence exports have grown almost six-fold in the last two years,” he said.</p>
      <p>$10 billion investment in aerospace and defense goods and services was expected by 2025, which could provide employment to two-three million people, he said.</p>
      <p>Singh stressed the government’s resolve to promote self-reliance in defense through the five I’s — Identification, Incubation, Innovation, Integration, and Indigenisation.</p>
      <p>The Defence Ministry would fund 250 startups, 16 personal initiatives, and five defense innovation hubs through the Defence Innovation Organisation in five years.</p>
      <p>Over 50 technological designs would be made to meet the armed forces’ requirements, while a Defence Innovation Fund was being planned to support the government participation through equity investment in defense startups, he said.  (IANS)</p>
