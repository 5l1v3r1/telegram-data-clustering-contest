      <h1>Farmers given ₹364 crore farm loans since 2011: Collector</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T13:42:25+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 13:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Special-Correspondent-Ramanathapuram-20639/" target="_blank">Special Correspondent Ramanathapuram</a></address>
      <p>Collector K. Veera Raghava Rao said cooperative institutions in the district, including the Primary Agriculture Primary Cooperative Credit Societies (PACCS) had extended total farm loans of ₹364 crore to 94,670 farmers in the last eight years since 2011.</p>
      <p>Addressing the 66th Cooperative Week celebrations after distributing welfare assistance to the tune of ₹15.85 crore to 463 beneficiaries here on Tuesday, he said the societies had also waived farm loans to the tune of ₹45.43 crore benefiting farmers from 2011 to 2019.</p>
      <p>He said the 181 PAACS in the district have also distributed agriculture implements, fertilisers, crop insurance and drought relief to the farmers. After a deficit rainfall in the last three years, the district has received good rainfall so far during the north east monsoon and farmers have taken up paddy cultivation in 1.25 lakh hectares of rain fed areas, he said.</p>
      <p>In October alone, the district received total rainfall of 384.41 mm, which was more than double the average rainfall received during the month, he said. As farm activities gained momentum, demand for fertilisers, especially urea has gone up and the district administration has geared up to meet the demand, he said.</p>
      <p>It has been estimated that farmers would require 11,025 metric tonnes of urea in November and the district administration has already supplied 5,974 metric tonnes of urea to the farmers. The existing stock position stood at 1,090 metric tonnes and steps have been taken to secure another 5,000 metric tonnes of Urea, Mr. Rao said.</p>
      <p>Pointing that farmers in the district were the major beneficiaries of Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), he said farmers had lost their crops due to failure of monsoons in the last three years. A total of 1.21 lakh farmers got total crop insurance of ₹529.06 crore for the year 2016-17.</p>
      <p>In the year 2017-18, a total of 1.44 lakh farmers were given crop insurance of ₹469.99 crore, he said. A total of 1.07 lakh farmers have insured their crops cultivated in 1.19 lakh hectares in the year 2018-19 and the district administration had received administrative sanction for disbursing ₹175 crore in the first phase, he added.</p>
      <p>Paramakudi MLA Sadan Prabakar, District Central Cooperative bank chairman M A Muniasamy, Joint Registrar, Cooperatives, P M Murugesan and officials were present at the function.</p>
