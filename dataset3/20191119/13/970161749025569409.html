      <h1>Piers Morgan gloats at Dan Walker as ratings war continues</h1>

      <p>Piers Morgan has reignited his spat with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/bbc-breakfast/">BBC Breakfast</a>’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/dan-walker/">Dan Walker</a> over viewing figures and is showing no sign of packing it in anytime soon.</p>
      <p>Just when thought the pair might put their differences aside for a second, the Good Morning Britain presenter waged another war against his television rival after new stats revealed that the two shows are slowly closing the gap between them.</p>
      <p>According to Piers, yesterday’s episode of Good Morning Britain had gained 74,000 viewers and was four share points up when compared to the episode that aired on the same day a year before.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, BBC Breakfast, which is still in the lead, lost 201,000 viewers when compared against the 2018 episode on the same day and was 3.2 share points down.</p>
      <p>Overjoyed by the news, Piers took to Twitter to gloat in Dan’s face, despite still coming second place, and said: ‘Hi mate, <span dir="ltr">@mrdanwalker</span> – fancy guzzling this with me to celebrate closest-ever rating gap between <span dir="ltr">@GMB</span> &amp; <span dir="ltr">@BBCBreakfast?’</span></p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>He then went on to ask his followers: ‘Are you one of the growing army of viewers who’ve dumped @BBCBreakfast for @GMB? Tell me why…’</p>
      <p>But of course, Piers didn’t stop there. Oh, no.</p>

      <p>The dad-of-four, still blown away by Good Morning Britain’s success, then shared a gif of people falling off the edge of a cliff alongside the comment: ‘Incredible that @BBCBreakfast has lost 201k viewers in a year.</p>
      <p>‘That’s 1,000 more people switching off every single day @mrdanwalker is on!’</p>
      <p>Despite being <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/21/piers-morgan-blasts-snivelling-sycophant-dan-walker-rivals-row-meghan-markle-10957476/">branded a ‘snivelling sycophant’ by Piers</a> just a few weeks ago, Dan took Piers’ comments regarding the show’s competition in his stride.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘You’ve changed your tune,’ he wrote before making it clear that ‘no one outside our offices care about figures.’</p>
      <p>We dread to think what will happen if Good Morning Britain ever overtakes BBC Breakfast…</p>
