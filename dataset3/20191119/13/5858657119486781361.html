      <p>SANTIAGO, Chile — Chilean police are suspending the broad use of pellet guns that have wounded thousands during protests and left more than 200 people without sight in one eye.</p>
      <p>National police director Mario Rozas said Tuesday that pellet guns will now be used only in extreme cases, in which the lives of civilians or police are at risk.</p>
      <p>Rozas has been widely criticized for the use of force by police against mass demonstrations over inequality that have gripped Chile for 33 days.</p>
      <p>Human rights groups have been flooded with reports of people injured by projectiles. Representatives from Amnesty International, the United Nations, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and Human Rights Watch are in Chile to investigate the use of force by police.</p>
