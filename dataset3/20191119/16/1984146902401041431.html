      <p>The owners of Heaton cafe The Butterfly Cabinet have bought another popular student hangout after acquiring the city centre Quilliam Brothers’ Teahouse.</p>
      <p>The Guwahati Limited has taken on the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-city-centre">Newcastle</a> University campus venue, now simply known as The Teahouse, after its founders "decided to explore new opportunities abroad".</p>
      <p>Simon Robson, Matthew Smith and Jennifer Burton, directors of The Guwahati Limited, have previously managed The Butterfly Cabinet in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/heaton">Heaton</a> , renowned for its all-day breakfasts, pancakes and long queues out of the door.</p>
      <p>Having drawn inspiration from its predecessor, The Butterfly Cabinet, The Teahouse will open from 9am and offers a variety of breakfasts, lunches and cakes with plenty of meat, vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free and dairy free options throughout the day and into the evening.</p>

      <p>The team have also expanded their operation into catering private cinema nights and function bookings. Moving into the new year, there are plans to launch an online platform for the purchase of loose tea and to establish an NHS discount for Teahouse patrons.</p>
      <p>As the landlord of the listed building, Newcastle University played a significant role in the Butterfly Cabinet’s takeover of the business, and was keen to ensure the space "maintained its popular appeal to students".</p>
      <p>Commercial law firm St James’ Square has advised The Guwahati Limited on the acquisition of the Teahouse.</p>
      <p>St James’ Square has helped three entrepreneurs with the purchase of The Teahouse, based at the Newcastle University campus.</p>
      <p>Jenny Atkin, senior associate at St James’ Square, project managed the acquisition, along with Katharine Mather at Barclays.</p>
      <p>Jenny said: “It was evident throughout the process of the acquisition how passionate Simon and the team are about running a business that appeals to the student experience and maintains the fun and relaxed ethos they have cultivated at their existing premises.</p>
      <p>“With the Butterfly Cabinet already so popular in Heaton, there was absolutely no doubt that the team were the perfect fit to take over the teahouse and it is a major coup for Newcastle University to have this offering so close to the Student’s Union.”</p>
      <p>Katharine Mather provided funding for the deal and said: “It’s great to see a local business thriving, expanding for the future and contributing to the local economy."</p>
