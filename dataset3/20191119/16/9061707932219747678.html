      <p>A Swadlincote mum who fell to pieces after a "whirlwind" year has told how deciding to get a tattoo turned her life around.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/swadlincote">Simply Needlecraft</a> boss Ami James was a successful businesswoman when her life started to fall apart.</p>
      <p>The 38-year-old, who has bipolar disorder, was left reeling when she broke up with her husband and her stepdad died from cancer.</p>
      <p>Ami, said: "I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder 10 years ago. It doesn’t really affect me with mood swings like it does others but it gives me really bad anxiety.</p>
      <p>"I have always been stable but a while ago I started to go downhill.</p>
      <p>"I separated from my husband, had to move house and downsize and my stepdad passed away from cancer.</p>

      <p>"It was a whirlwind year and my mind just ran away. It seemed like everything was going wrong, it was one thing after another."</p>
      <p>Ami says her circumstances destroyed her confidence and she was full of self-doubt.</p>
      <p>She said: "I lost motivation and all confidence in my business and things got really bad.</p>
      <p>"I just had to carry on because I have a son (Ben, 15) and I have no choice. You get up out of bed in the morning and do it all again but it was a struggle.</p>
      <p>"I went from being someone who was quite ambitious to someone who started questioning everything.</p>
      <p>"I was wondering whether I was good enough.</p>
      <p>"It felt like things were stacking up on top of me and they couldn’t get any worse.</p>
      <p>"I was becoming someone who was the polar opposite to what I am really like."</p>
      <p>A major turning point came when Ami decided to get a tattoo, courtesy of Swadlincote artist Kevin Paul, in November last year.</p>
      <p>Kevin has worked with major stars included Rihanna and Ed Sheeran and agreed to tattoo a key on Ami's foot to represent "opening new doors".</p>

      <p>She said: "My life was changing, so I went for a new tattoo on a whim.</p>
      <p>"I first met Kevin a couple of years ago when he did a tattoo for me.</p>
      <p>"I spent five hours sitting in the chair. We got talking and he really helped me.</p>
      <p>"He has had anxiety in the past so he knew where I was coming from and he just told me to look at what I have and what I have achieved.</p>
      <p>"He taught me that things are much simpler than they seem. It was a breath of fresh air.</p>
      <p>"Kevin made a big difference, because instead of looking at the bad things, he just focused on what I did have and he got straight to the point.</p>
      <p>"Family and friends tried to make me feel better, but the pity from them just made me feel worse.</p>
      <p>"I know they meant well, but I felt like I was worrying them which only made me feel worse."</p>
      <p>Swadlincote Haberdashery Simply Needlecraft had to close last year as a result of Ami's problems.</p>
      <p>"But she is now back to her old self and will reopen it in January.</p>
      <p>She said: "I had a complete change of mind and since getting my tattoo and things are on the up.</p>
      <p>"I have moved house and I am setting my business up in January.</p>
      <p>"I have got my confidence back and I am starting to feel more like myself again.</p>
      <p>"I am also teaching sewing around the country which is my passion.</p>
      <p>"I dread to think where I would be now if I'd not got that tattoo that day. Kevin helped change my life."</p>
