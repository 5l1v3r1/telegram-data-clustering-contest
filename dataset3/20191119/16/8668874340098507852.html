      <h1>Saracens now hit in the pocket with a European fine</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:21:55+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:21</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Heagney</a></address>
      <p>Saracens have paid an undisclosed fine after accepting they breached the 2019/20 Heineken Champions Cup participation agreement by not making the required club representatives available for a key EPCR promotional event.</p>
      <p>On November 6, director of rugby Mark McCall and captain <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens/players/brad-barritt/">Brad Barritt</a> did not attend the official season launch of the 2019/20 Heineken Champions Cup and Challenge Cup for Premiership and PRO14 clubs which was staged at the Principality Stadium in Cardiff.</p>
      <p>An EPCR statement read: “Having previously indicated that they would be represented at the event, Saracens’ failure to attend constituted a breach of the 2019/20 Heineken Champions Cup media rules, and compromised EPCR’s ability to deliver the rights contracted to its broadcast, commercial and media partners.</p>
      <p>“In light of this breach of its rules, EPCR has decided to impose a fine on <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/saracens">Saracens</a> which has been paid by the club, and the sum of which will remain undisclosed.</p>
      <p>“EPCR appreciates the subsequent efforts made by Saracens to grant rights-holding broadcasters special interview access to members of their Heineken Champions Cup squad in the week before the start of the tournament.”</p>

      <p>Saracens wanted to avoid the media spotlight in Cardiff as the European launch was taking place the day after Premiership Rugby found them <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/news/sponsorship-experts-stark-warning-for-toxic-saracens-nigel-currie/">guilty of breaching the salary cap</a>, fining them £5.3million and deducting 35 league points.</p>
      <p>Their absence didn’t go down well with other clubs. Harlequins skipper <a href="https://www.rugbypass.com/premiership/teams/harlequins/players/chris-robshaw/">Chris Robshaw</a> told <i>RugbyPass</i> on the day: “I do think they should be here and fronting up.</p>

      <p>“Then again, you are asking a player to do it, you are asking a coach to do it and are they the ones who are making those (salary cap) decisions?</p>
      <p>“To put them out into this… it is going to be a tough time for them, but it is one they have brought on to themselves and they are going to have to deal with it for some time I’d imagine.”</p>
