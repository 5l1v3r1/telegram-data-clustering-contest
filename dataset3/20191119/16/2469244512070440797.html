      <p>Plans for a new Premier Inn for Kingsbridge and an Aldi for Ivybridge have been put on hold.</p>
      <p>South Hams District Council were set to hold consultations with the public over the two schemes at the end of 2019, but they have now been delayed until the new year.</p>
      <p>The delay has been blamed on the General Election being called and the pre-election Purdah period that means councils have to be careful not to do anything in public that could sway a member of the public to vote for one person or political party.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the council said: “It is therefore strongly recommended that councils do not begin any potentially controversial consultations in this pre-election period.</p>
      <p>“The public consultations that South Hams District Council were planning to hold on a hotel or residential scheme for Kingsbridge and a value supermarket for Ivybridge, will now take place in the new year.”</p>
      <p>The Kingsbridge hotel scheme would have seen a public consultation take place on the principle of whether the town is in favour of a hotel being built, before any formal planning application was submitted.</p>

      <p>South Hams District Council’s executive earlier this year supported the principle of plans for a brand new 85-bedroom hotel to be built on a derelict site behind the leisure centre near Rope Walk.</p>
      <p>Premier Inn want to work with the council by running an 85 bed hotel on the site at a cost of £10m from the Council and a further £10m from Premier Inn. They have said that this could create the equivalent of 90 full time jobs during the build and 24 when the hotel is up and running. They also said that they could being an extra 700 visitors to the town every week and an extra £525,000 could be spent in the town ever year.</p>
      <p>The Ivybridge Aldi scheme is part of an £11m regeneration package to boost footfall in the town.</p>

      <p>The revised business case for the proposal, which includes building a supermarket on part of Leonards Road car park, relocating the police station, scout hut and skate park and increasing parking provision by 57 spaces, was agreed by South Hams District Council’s executive earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Heads of Terms have been agreed with Aldi Stores Ltd for the site and the committee heard that around 60 jobs would be created and around 2,000 new customers a day would enter the town.</p>
      <p>Formal consultation on the proposal will now take place and the results of it will come back to the executive prior to the final green light for the scheme being given.</p>
