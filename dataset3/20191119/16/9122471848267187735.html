      <h1>Wife Of Redskins QB Alex Smith Posts Inspiring Video</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:13:06+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>When Alex Smith went down with a horrific injury in 2018 there weren’t just doubts about his career, there was legit concern that he could lose his leg. Despite going through 17 surgeries, the Pro Bowl quarterback has been resilient throughout his entire rehab process.</p>
      <p>Smith had the Redskins in position to make the playoffs last year prior to suffering the injury. He landed awkwardly on his leg, which resulted in a compound fracture to his tibia and fibula.</p>
      <p>There’s no telling if Smith will ever return to the NFL. However, it doesn’t appear that he’s ready to leave that dream behind just yet.</p>
      <p>It took several months for Smith to walk and train again, but that hasn’t taken a toll on him. In fact, the 35-year-old quarterback seems upbeat about his rehab.</p>
      <p>His wife, Elizabeth Smith, posted a touching video that shows his recovery from such a devastating injury.</p>

      <p>Elizabeth Smith posted this video one year after the injury occurred.</p>
      <p>An injury of this magnitude could end players’ careers, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that Smith can’t mount a comeback. After all, Teddy Bridgewater managed to bounce back from an injury that nearly resulted in his leg getting amputated.</p>
      <p>Hopefully we could see Smith back on the field within the next year or two. Even if he doesn’t though, it’s remarkable to see how well he’s recovered.</p>
