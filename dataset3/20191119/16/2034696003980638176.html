      <p>The script for <i>Joker</i> is now available to read in full online.</p>
      <p>Todd Phillips’ record-breaking origin story, starring Joaquin Phoenix, came to cinemas last month.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>The script, available to read in full here, begins with a declaration of the film’s intentions from director Todd Phillips and Scott Silver, who he co-wrote the film’s screenplay with.</p>
      <p>“This story takes place in its own universe,” the statement begins.</p>
      <p>“It has <a href="https://movieweb.com/the-batman-joker-origin-movie-connections/">no connection to any of the DC films</a> that have come before it. We see it as a classic Warner Bros. movie. Gritty, intimate and oddly funny, the characters live in the real world and the stakes are personal.</p>

      <p>It continues: “Although it is never mentioned in the film, this story takes place in the past. Let’s call it 1981. It’s a troubled time. The crime rate in Gotham is at record highs. A garbage strike has crippled the city for the past six weeks. And the divide between the “haves” and the “have-nots” is palpable. Dreams are beyond reach, slipping into delusions. TP/SS”</p>
