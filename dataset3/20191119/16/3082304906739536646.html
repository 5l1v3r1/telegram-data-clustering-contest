        <b>Premier League giants Manchester United have been handed a major setback as their key target Kalidou Koulibaly has referred to his current club, Napoli, as his “home” – thereby hinting that he is not ready to join the Red Devils just yet.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Take a look at the series of tweets right below:</p>

      <p>Koulibaly’s message translates to the following:</p>
      <p>“This is where my children were born. This is where I grew up as a man and a player. This is where my family and I feel at home.”</p>
      <p>That being said, one can only assume that the Senegalese defender has discreetly shut down all rumours of his impending transfer to Manchester United.</p>
      <p>Last month, Napoli chief Aurelio De Laurentiis had revealed that he once turned down a €100million bid for the highly-rated centre-back, but further added that he is sure of a time when the Serie A club will have to part ways with their star player.</p>
      <p>“I loved Koulibaly the man, so I refused a €105million offer, but I know that a time will come when I’ll have to sell him,” he said, before adding:</p>
      <p>“Whoever says we didn’t improve our defence is wrong”.</p>
      <p>But with the 28-year-old’s latest tweet, it seems likely that he will stay on in Italy, at least for the time being – if not for a longer term.</p>
