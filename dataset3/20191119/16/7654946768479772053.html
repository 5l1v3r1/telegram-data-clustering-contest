      <p>A North Dakota mom reunited with her missing daughter after spotting her being interviewed on a TV news program, according to a report.</p>
      <p>Jill Rosenow said she was stunned to come across a news segment featuring her daughter, Alice Crawford, who was homeless in Denver, Colorado, <a href="https://www.wbaltv.com/article/woman-notices-daughter-who-went-missing-for-months-on-television-being-interviewed/29827895">news station WBAL-TV reported</a>.</p>
      <p>“It was cold. She was cold. It broke my heart,” Jill Rosenow said. “I cried. Seeing my daughter on the streets, homeless … a mother is only as happy as her saddest child.”</p>
      <p>Two months earlier, Crawford had disappeared after attending a rehab center for drug addiction, the report said.</p>

      <p>The TV segment on Oct. 29 showed Crawford telling news crews that she was sleeping behind a dumpster in Denver.</p>
      <p>“This is death weather,” Crawford told 9News at the time. “If you’re not prepared for this, you’re going to die.”</p>
      <p>Her mother said she was horrified to see her daughter on the streets and traveled with family members to find her.</p>
      <p>“It’s just surreal to think that my daughter was standing here homeless and cold,” Rosenow said.</p>
      <p>The family scoured the streets until they found her in a public restroom.</p>
      <p>“Just like that. In a wonderful way it was over. The search was over,” Rosenow told 9News.</p>
