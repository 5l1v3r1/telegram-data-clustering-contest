      <p>Liverpool's main sponsor Standard Chartered have become the latest major business to cut ties with Prince Andrew over the Royal's links to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>The company have been the main sponsor of the Reds since 2010 and their relationship with club will extend until the end of the 2022-23 season, making it the second-longest sponsorship deal in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> 's history.</p>
      <p>Standard Chartered revealed to <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7701239/The-TOXIC-Duke-Standard-Chartered-latest-big-firm-cut-ties-Prince-Andrew.html">MailOnline</a> that its bosses have decided it will no longer partner the Duke of York's business start-up project: Pitch@Palace.</p>
      <p>A spokesman said: "We won't be renewing the sponsorship when it ends in February."</p>
      <p>Prince Andrew has faced further scrutiny and backlash after he defended his friendship with Epstein in an interview with BBC Newsnight.</p>
      <p>One of London's big four accounting firms KPMG was the first company to end its Â£100,000-a-year sponsorship last night.</p>
      <p>Pitch@Palace was launched in 2014 to give entrepreneurs the chance to bid for finance and meet potential mentors at events attended by the prince.</p>
