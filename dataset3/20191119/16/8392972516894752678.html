      <p>Things are set to turn violent when a furious Marlon punches Graham in next week's <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/">Emmerdale</a>.</p>
      <p>Knowing Marlon isn't Graham's biggest fan, Kim implies to Marlon that Graham shouldn't be around his son, Leo.</p>
      <p>But neither of them see that <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/a-short-history-of-emmerdales-rhona-goskirk/">Rhona</a> has arrived.</p>
      <p>As Kim quickly makes tracks, Rhona tears into the chef for siding with Kim and for the first time Marlon begins to softens towards Graham.</p>
      <p>Later at the cafe, Rhona shares some harsh words with Kim for trying to poison Marlon against Graham.</p>

      <p>However Kim assures her that her success winning Marlon over won't last and she begins to come up with a plan.</p>
      <p>Graham tries to reassure Rhona but it's obvious he's thinking about the possibilities of what Kim is plotting. And it's not long before he finds out what her plan is...</p>
      <p>The next day Graham gets a text from Kim asking for employees to meet her at the pub as she has an announcement.</p>
      <p>Graham's jaw drops when he realises the reason Kim has thrown the party.</p>
