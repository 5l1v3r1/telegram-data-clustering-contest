        <b>A fire broke out on 15 November at dawn in the backyard of the GNR post of Mesão Frio, in Vila Real, leaving the building unusable, according to sources of this police force and fire brigade.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Major Eduardo Lima, public relations officer of the GNR Vila Real territorial commander, told Lusa news agency that the fire left the Mesão Frio post "unusable" and that a solution has now been found for the temporary installation of the military in space provided by the City Council.</p>
      <p>The priority was, he said, to ensure policing and care for the population of Mesão Frio.</p>
      <p>This GNR post has a staff of 20 military personnel.</p>
      <p>The warning for the fire was given at 4.30am and to the place were mobilized 20 firefighters, who had the support of six vehicles.</p>
      <p>It is a ground floor and first floor building, located in the centre of Mesão Frio village, and according to the source, the fire started on the first floor, in the Camaratas area.</p>
      <p>Mesão Frio Fire Commander Paulo Silva told Lusa that the operatives were faced with “a very complicated situation” due to the bursting of ammunition and that, therefore, the fire fighting only took place after the conditions of safety.</p>
      <p>Eduardo Lima said that "the collection of weapons and ammunition was not affected", adding that it is suspected that a weapon of one of the military that was on duty was in the location affected by the fire.</p>
      <p>The official said that the origin of the fire, which may be related to a fireplace on the first floor, will now be investigated.</p>
      <p>Paulo Silva said that the upper part of the building “burned all over,” leaving the “GNR post unusable”.</p>
      <p>By 9am, firefighters were still on site in aftermath operations.</p>
