      <p>Sian Lloyd issued a grovelling apology after comparing a traffic jam to "holocaust".</p>
      <p>The former ITV weather presenter, who appeared in I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! in 2003, came under fire after tweeting about the traffic in her native Swansea.</p>
      <p>Followers blasted the TV personality for her "disgusting" tweet, which she's since deleted.</p>
      <p>"Yet another traffic holocaust in Swansea today. Probs the worst ever. Over 1 HOUR to get to the Village Hotel from Mumbles. Took sis 1 hr 40 mins to Neath earlier. Everything is wrong about traffic management in Swansea," she'd written, according to the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/10375788/sian-lloyd-twitter-traffic-jam-holocaust/">Sun</a> .</p>

      <p>After angry fans told her she was out of order to bring up the Holocaust, Sian tweeted multiple apologies - and claimed she hadn't been referring to the Nazi genocide of European Jewish people during World War II.</p>
      <p>"Hey guys, it's the noun with a small h. I'm half Jewish myself. Would never want to cause offence. Huge apology if I did," Sian tweeted.</p>

      <p>"I did not do that [compare traffic to the holocaust]. And would never do so. It's the noun with a small h, which is a bona fida word. Not the historical one with a big H. But clearly a bad choice. Big apologies."</p>
      <p>She replied to another follower: "I meant the noun with a small h. I so did not mean it in the historical way, with the big H. Big sorry if iit caused offence. Obvs the wrong word to use. So sorry."</p>

      <p>She later added: "I've been [to Auschwitz] &amp; I'm half Jewish. I wrote &amp; meant the noun with a small h, a bona fida word, and not the awful historical noun with a big H. A big mistake to have used the noun. So sorry to have offended folk."</p>
      <p>One furious <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> user blasted: "I think you mean a whole nation/religion not 'folk' And being 1/2 Jewish as well. Shame on you you parasite."</p>
      <p>Sian hit back: "Folk meaning offending folk in general. As in people. Whatever their religion or nationality."</p>
      <p>Mirror Online has contacted Sian's rep for comment.</p>
