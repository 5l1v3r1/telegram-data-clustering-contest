      <p>Nov. 19 (UPI) -- <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Amazoncom/?tps=1">Amazon</a> has renewed its <i>Lord of the Rings</i> series ahead of the show's premiere.</p>
      <p>The company confirmed Monday on Twitter that it picked up the forthcoming fantasy series for a second season.</p>
      <p>"'The road goes ever on and on.' #LOTRonPrime," the<a href="https://twitter.com/LOTRonPrime/status/1196603108740087808"> post</a> reads, quoting "The Walking Song," a song Bilbo Baggins sings in <i>The Hobbit</i> and <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> books.</p>
      <p><a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/the-lord-of-the-rings-series-renewed-season-2-amazon-early-renewal-season-1-hiatus-writers-room-reassembled-1202788730/">Deadline said</a> pre-production on Season 1 is underway in New Zealand. The series will go on a 4-5 month hiatus after filming the first two episodes for Season 1, during which the writing team will map out and write the bulk of the Season 2 scripts.</p>
      <p>Completing the Season 2 scripts will allow the <i>Lord of the Rings</i> team to possibly film part of Season 2 during the Season 1 shoot or film the remainder of Season 1 and Season 2 back-to-back.</p>
      <p>The <i>Lord of the Rings </i>series is based on the <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/J.R.R._Tolkien/?tps=1">J.R.R. Tolkien</a> book series of the same name, which was previously adapted by <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Peter_Jackson/?tps=1">Peter Jackson</a> as a trilogy of films. The show is set in Middle Earth and <a href="https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/TV/2019/03/08/Amazons-Lord-of-the-Rings-series-to-take-place-in-Second-Age/5751552069084/">will take place</a> in the Second Age.</p>
      <p>J.D. Payne and Patrick McKay will serve as showrunners and executive producers, with J.A. Bayona <a href="https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/TV/2019/07/03/Lord-of-the-Rings-JA-Bayona-joins-Amazon-series-as-director/6701562170907/">to direct the first two episodes</a>.</p>
      <p>Amazon has yet to announce the official cast, although <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Will_Poulter/?tps=1">Will Poulter</a> is reportedly <a href="https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/TV/2019/09/04/Reports-Will-Poulter-to-lead-Amazons-Lord-of-the-Rings-series/7581567638521/">up for the lead role</a>.</p>
