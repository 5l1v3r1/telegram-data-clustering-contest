      <h1>Just kidding! Darren Till was ‘blind drunk’ during Yoel Romero callout</h1>

      <p>Former welterweight title contender Darren Till, who recently moved up to middleweight and slugged his way into the Top 5, <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2018/9/3/17814870/ufc-darren-till-eyes-move-to-middleweight-no-hurry-face-yoel-romero-mma">made it very clear</a> that he wants no part of <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/11/19/20972220/latest-ufc-rankings-conor-mcgregor-continues-fade-shogun-rua-dropped-top-15-mma">No. 3-ranked</a> Yoel Romero, who is the master of <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2017/2/7/14525874/ufc-yoel-romero-even-michael-bisping-s-family-knows-he-trying-to-duck-me-mma">long-distance relationships</a>.</p>
      <p>That’s why mixed martial arts (MMA) were a bit confused when “The Gorilla” abruptly changed his tune and <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/11/8/20954081/midnight-mania-darren-till-yoel-romero-ufc-espn">demanded a showdown</a> opposite “Soldier of God.” What changed? Only the Englishman’s sobriety, which Till refers to as “having fun.”</p>
      <p>“I was blind drunk. Yes, so my friend opened up a great bar in Liverpool, we got invited to the opening and I was celebrating the win,” Till told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrYnd41Pd5o">MMAUK</a> (transcribed by <a href="https://www.bjpenn.com/mma-news/ufc/darren-till-says-he-called-out-yoel-romero-when-he-was-blind-drunk/">Cole Shelton</a>). “I was with the guys and I said, I had a few beers and said, ‘watch this.’ So, I went onto Google, I’ll get an image of Yoel, cause he is a scary dude, I said I’ll post that. He was like really bro? I said why not, let’s start a little controversy. So, I tagged him let’s go and it just blew up.”</p>
      <p>I don’t want to be that guy who wags his finger and tsk-tsk-tsks someone who drinks, but the last time Till and his boys got shitfaced, <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/4/21/18509928/reports-darren-till-arrested-in-canary-islands-for-allegedly-stealing-cab-trashing-hotel-mma-ufc">a hotel was trashed and a taxi cab was stolen</a>. Never a good sign when a night out for booze <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/4/22/18511215/darren-till-heavily-fined-following-quick-trial-hotel-rampage-taxi-trouble-costa-adeje">costs more than a fight purse</a>.</p>
      <p>“I remember the next morning I woke up and my girl was sat on the couch, because I slept on the couch, and she was like you called Yoel out,” Till said. “So, I went onto Google and got the monkey eyes and told my guy to add when you wake up and realize you called out Yoel. Everyone knows when I’m going on a tirade on Twitter it is because I’m having a drink. It is never normal. I’m having fun.”</p>
      <p>Here's the hangover tweet:</p>

      <p>Till is expected to face former middleweight champion, Robert Whittaker, when the promotion <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/11/14/20964652/darren-till-accepts-callout-agrees-fight-robert-whittaker-ufc-london-mma">makes its return to London</a> early next year (<a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/4/28/18521604/mike-perry-has-enough-money-chill-willing-wait-darren-till-fight-mma">sorry, Mike</a>). Romero, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/11/12/20962120/ufc-dana-white-respects-israel-adesanya-desire-face-yoel-romero-will-work-booking-title-fight-mma">may get first crack</a> at newly-crowned middleweight champion, Israel Adesanya.</p>
      <p>Not sure yet what UFC plans to do with <a href="https://www.mmamania.com/2019/11/18/20970883/adesanya-jared-cannonier-not-yoel-romero-second-most-dangerous-guy-middleweight-ufc">this guy</a>.</p>
