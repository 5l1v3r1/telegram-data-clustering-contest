        <b>How would you describe your sound?</b>
      </p>
      <p>We’d describe our sound as having a 60s swagger, an 80s groove and a 90s attack. We try and combine influences of all the great music throughout the decades.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What inspires your music?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The culture of where we live and our experiences that we’ve had growing up. It’s about what we see and who we are.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Can you give us some background about your latest release?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Our latest release is all about our experiences of the euphoria of nightlife. But it’s not subjective to that, it could be relative to anything that makes you feel on top of the world or in your element.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What do you like most about touring?</b>
      </p>
      <p>The laughs you have, just the general vibe of travelling with your best pals doing the things you love and making memories on the way.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What can people expect from your upcoming Nottingham gig?</b>
      </p>
      <p>I think it was the first date to sell out and we’ve never played in Nottingham before. Expect t it to be full of energy and be glad you’ve got a ticket. We're trying really hard to focus on making these gigs a spectacle.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What are you enjoying listening to at the moment?</b>
      </p>
      <p>We’re loving a lot at the moment, we’re big on disco and rock and roll. You can hear a lot of that in our new material.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What’s been your best live gig appearance as a performer?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Probably the institute 2 in Birmingham back in February. To play to 500 people in your hometown. pretty much done by ourselves, was something we’re really proud of. The atmosphere was electric but we’re going to top that on this tour.</p>
      <p>
