      <h1>Jerry Jones Wasn’t A Fan Of The Colin Kaepernick Workout</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:32:53+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/danlyons" target="_blank">Dan Lyons</a></address>
      <p>Colin Kaepernick’s workout in front of NFL teams happened on Saturday… but not in the manner that the NFL had been planning last week.</p>
      <p>Hours before he was set to go through drills at the Atlanta Falcons facility in front of a majority of NFL teams, Kaepernick abruptly changed the venue, in an effort to gain more control over the situation. He wound up working out at a local high school, streaming the event on YouTube, with seven team representatives in attendance.</p>
      <p>According to some in attendance, Kaepernick showed off the same <a href="https://thespun.com/more/top-stories/colin-kaepernick-workout-results-feedback-elite-arm">elite arm talent</a> that he had when he was still in NFL starter. The 32-year old former San Francisco 49er’s talent was never really called into question, though.</p>
      <p>Whether his performance in the Atlanta area on Saturday was enough to get back on a roster remains to be seen. If Kaepernick is going to be signed, I wouldn’t bet on the Dallas Cowboys being the team right now.</p>
      <p>Obviously, the Cowboys have an established starter in Dak Prescott. He’s backed up by Cooper Rush, a little-used Central Michigan product with three pass attempts in four games over the last three seasons.</p>
      <p>Jerry Jones appeared on <a href="https://1053thefan.radio.com/media/audio-channel/jerry-jones-show-defense-needs-tackle-better">105.3 The Fan in Dallas</a> today. He was asked about the Kaepernick workout, and whether the team would consider adding him to the quarterback room, potentially supplanting Rush.</p>
      <p>In a word, no.</p>

      <p>Jones said that he’s comfortable with his quarterback situation, with Prescott and Rush comprising the two-deep at the position. He also conveyed disappointment in how things played out Saturday, saying he thought it became a “circus” without explicitly criticizing Kaepernick or weighing in on whether he thinks he’ll play again.</p>
      <p>Via <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/19/jerry-jones-colin-kaepernick-workout-nfl-circus/">TMZ</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>“We of course, aren’t in the quarterback business. We’re in the business of anytime, anywhere looking for talent — whether we need it now or whether we need it in the future.<br/><br/>“So, the way these things work, you had that evaluation for you whether you’re there or you’re not. You have that evaluation. And, I think it’s unfortunate that you can’t just zero in on the business at hand, and that is evaluating a player that might or might not help you win a football game or move the chains within a football game.<br/><br/>“That situation from the get-go probably had a lot more that wasn’t about football involved in it and consequently we got the results of that dynamic.”</blockquote>
      <p>It always seemed a bit unlikely that a team would sign Colin Kaepernick this late in the year. Perhaps the door will be open for 2020, but this remains a “believe it when I see it ” situation after years being held out of the sport.</p>
