      <h1>This Is the 1969 TV Documentary the Royal Family Doesn’t Want You to See</h1>

      <p>The Windsors finally get their Kardashian moment <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2019/11/the-crown-season-3-netflix-review.html">in the new season</a> of <a href="https://www.vulture.com/tv/the-crown/"><i>The Crown</i></a><i>, </i>where, nestled in the fourth episode, “<a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/the-crown-recap-season-3-episode-4-bubbikins.html">Bubbikins</a>,” an intriguing reality-television subplot takes shape: Prince Philip (<a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/tobias-menzies-the-crown-prince-philip-profile.html">Tobias Menzies</a>), sensing the royal family is losing favor with the common folk in the Swinging Sixties, decides to commission a documentary in an attempt to humanize them. (And also, uh, to maybe secure some more tax money for the family.) No acting, no artifice, just the real thing — nothing is off-limits, even the corgi-filled barbecues! “We’re being filmed watching television,” <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2019/10/helena-bonham-carter-the-crown-princess-margaret.html">Princess Margaret</a> deadpans. “People might watch us watching television on their own television sets at home. This is really plumbing new depths of banality.”</p>
      <p>The reception was … brutal, both in the purview of <i>The Crown</i>’s fictionalized realm and in real life. A joint ITV-BBC documentary, <i>Royal Family,</i> was indeed spearheaded by the Windsors (and their royal press secretary at the time, William Heseltine) and released in 1969. The concept was fairly simple as reality-show conceits go: The family allowed a film crew to follow them at agreed-upon times for a year, which, in turn, gave the public unprecedented access to what happens behind closed doors at Buckingham Palace. There’s a picnic, some dinner-table talk, and even an ice-cream trip. Perhaps the most scandalous thing is Princess Anne calling a lunch spread an “absolute failure.” Some 75 percent of the U.K. was <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/8255483/Royal-family-documentary-revived-four-decades-on.html">estimated</a> to have tuned in, but it received such significant backlash that it’s been banned from broadcast since 1972. (This is due to Queen Elizabeth II <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150611004024/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/trying-to-be-useful-twentyfive-years-ago-the-windsors-attempted-to-recreate-their-public-image-using-a-television-film-to-portray-the-royal-family-as-ordinary-hardworking-people-as-this-final-extract-from-a-new-book-on-the-dynasty-shows-it-was-a-ploy-that-went-terribly-wrong-1423599.html">maintaining</a> the copyright of the film.)</p>
      <p>Interestingly, the only way someone can legally view the documentary in 2019 is by (1) being a credited researcher or historian, (2) obtaining written permission by Buckingham Palace, and (3) paying a cool £35 fee. Vulture would<i> </i>have <i>absolutely </i>gone through these reasonable steps to watch it, but, in a cruel twist of fate, you must physically trek to the BBC headquarters in London for access. So, we’re left with a decent replacement: A few <i>Royal Family </i>clips that have been dispersed throughout the years in other documentaries, which gives us a taste of what exactly the big fuss was about.</p>

      <p>It — and we can’t stress this enough — isn’t particularly compelling TV. </p>

      <p>But the royals don’t want us to watch it and we can actually see the queen smiling a few times, which makes it pretty good by default, innit? </p>
