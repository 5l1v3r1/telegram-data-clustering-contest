        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/alfa-romeo-racing">Alfa Romeo</a> had their best weekend at the Brazilian Grand Prix after <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/kimi-raikkonen">Kimi Raikkonen</a> finished 4th and <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/antonio-giovinazzi">Antonio Giovinazzi</a> finished 5th.

      <p><i>"We can be really happy and proud with this result,"</i> Vasseur said after the race. <i>"To bring two cars in the points just outside the podium is the reward for the hard work of everyone in the team. We didn't let our head drop in the races where we were unlucky and now we can celebrate our best result of the season.</i></p>

        <i>"There was no defining factor today: everyone did a great job - in the cockpit, in the pitstops, on the pitwall and back at base. We have made a lot of progress in the last few races, but it wasn't until today that it showed. Now we can look forward to the chance to do another good race in Abu Dhabi and finish the season on a high."</i>
      </p>
      <p>Many teams outperformed their usual rankings in Brazil and fans will hope that this level of competition will continue into the last race of the season and into next year. </p>
