      <p>Nov. 19 (UPI) -- Animal rescuers in Germany said a Chinese crab found wandering on a city street may have escaped from a restaurant kitchen.</p>
      <p>The Animal Rescue Service in Dusseldorf said the mitten crab, a Chinese delicacy, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TierrettungsdienstSchuetz/videos/561480704615261/?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARBRUXtKn5NqRChTxw5F8m-fAAWWep9DF_FQdf403lXAiqjo0Zsl_ZdhrbaGHby9ZD59JlgpimdogujhU3Qi0kgxsIC5yaENBQJyBN45fCfekz-rPGba5pbLBkniYk6igaIMfh7bv32w3HK6Zh7tDY_PtMen7DxF7YgLRXFUY6RPXQH5eNDCVHapFkyeMEierJ7L1gtx0px1_B72-QxQrLzbJQkNb22o7WopzWMD7E2qZ-eH5-hgLnJGXdeiETZD8tMJIL-4PUW1qnvRSQobS_sImksZbvRqqFE77O9s4u_4iIMzDY9tPjptWLXFwk6aDtab4oPqQlaXW0eNkbYOZRjsH0GWSubYQJA&amp;__tn__=-R">was captured</a> after being spotted wandering loose on a street in the Pempelfort area of the city.</p>
      <p>Carsten Schutz said there are several restaurants near where the crab, dubbed Krusty, was found.</p>
      <p>"It's possible it escaped from a cooking pot," Schutz <a href="https://inews.co.uk/light-relief/offbeat/chinese-crab-germany-escape-cooking-pot-1279484">told iNews.</a></p>
      <p>He said the crab also appears to be unusually friendly, indicating it may have been someone's pet.</p>
      <p>The Animal Rescue Service said Krusty's eventual fate has not been decided. The species is considered invasive in Germany.</p>
