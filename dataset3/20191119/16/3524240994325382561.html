      <p>John Charles, Makurdi</p>
      <p>Benue State police have rescued a kidnapped medical doctor, Emmanuel Orhembe, three days after he was abducted.</p>
      <p>The command spokesperson, Deputy Superintendent of Police, Catherine Anene, who disclosed this to journalists on Tuesday said that the kidnapped doctor spent three days in kidnappers’ den.</p>
      <p>Anene  said that the kidnap of the medical doctor last week drew the attention of the command which quickly sent operatives to fish out the culprits</p>
      <p>She added that the medical doctor who works at a hospital in Gboko was found and rescued from his abductors in Mbayior forest after three days in captivity by Operation Zenda led by SP Justin Gberindyer.</p>
      <p>The PPRO said that men of operation Zenda engaged the kidnappers in a gun duel killing three of the kidnappers while others fled with bullet wounds.</p>
      <p>Anene, however, called on residents in the state particularly those living in Gboko to avail the police and other security agencies useful information that will help nip crime in the bud.</p>
      <p>Narrating his ordeal, Orhember, who appreciated the police commissioner, CP Garba Mukkadas, for the quick intervention said some gunmen stormed his house and took him away.</p>
      <p>He said, “I was made to lie down on the ground. They beat me and in the process, they bruised my head and ankle with iron. One of them shot me in  the leg, asking me to provide money.”</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, items recovered during the gun duel were assorted charms, arms and ammunition including phones, sim cards etc.</p>
