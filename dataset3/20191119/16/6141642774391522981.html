      <p>Flood-hit homes and businesses will be able to receive up to £5,000 to help them pay for property improvements that protect them from future flooding.</p>
      <p>The Government announced the grants, which will be made available through local authorities from the end of November, in the wake of severe flooding in parts of Yorkshire and the Midlands.</p>
      <p>The grants will be open to homes and businesses that have been seriously affected in the floods this autumn.</p>
      <p>They are designed to go towards the additional costs of installing fittings and materials that help protect properties from flood water damage in the future, such as putting in flood doors and raising the electrics off ground level.</p>

      <p>Environment Secretary Theresa Villiers said: “My thoughts go out to all those affected by the devastating flooding which has taken place over the last two weeks.</p>
      <p>“As we look ahead to the coming months, it is crucial that people are able to prepare for future flooding.</p>
      <p>“That is why we are providing increased funding to enable people to make their homes more resilient and better protected if floods happen again.”.</p>
      <p>The support for homes and businesses comes on top of grants worth up to £25,000 which will be made available to flood-hit farmers in northern England, officials said.</p>
      <p>The Environment Agency is continuing work to reduce flood risk and to ensure that it is safe for people to move back into their homes, the Government said.</p>
