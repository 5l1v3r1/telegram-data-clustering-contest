      <p>The officials concerned have completed the survey works to identify the encroachment of Raj Nala along a 10.5-km stretch from Gabbur to Unkal, Hubballi-Dharwad Municipal Corporation (HDMC) Commissioner Suresh Itnal has said.</p>
      <p>Speaking at a Meet-the-Press programme organised by the Dharwad Journalists Guild here on Tuesday, Mr. Itnal said that during the survey, a total of 153 encroachments were identified. These form 128 full encroachments and 25 partial encroachments. The length of the encroachments is a minimum seven metres and a maximum 21 metres. It was noticed during the survey that encroachers had taken land on lease for short periods several years ago. The lease was for constructing sheds but large buildings have been raised. In some cases, the Slum Board has issued title deeds. The officials are looking into these matters and cross checking the documents, he said.</p>
      <p>Further, Mr. Itnal stated that a plan to clear encroachments on public property between Vani Vilas Circle and Unkal Cross has been finalised.</p>
      <p>Accordingly, 66 families would be shifted and provided accommodation at the G+3 apartments proposed to be built for them, he said.</p>
      <p>To a query on the bad shape of public parks, Mr. Itnal said that there are 524 parks in the city. To ensure better maintenance of these parks with public participation, the HDMC has chalked out a scheme called Nere Hore Samiti.</p>
      <p>Under this scheme, voluntary and service organisations and others would be roped in for maintenance of the parks. Guidelines have been sent for the approval of the HDMC administrator. This apart, an open gym equipment would be installed in two public parks — one each at Kolikere and Kelageri gardens under the AMRUT scheme. Works to improving facilities at Nehru Stadium and Ambedkar Stadium would be taken up. A sports complex would come up at Rayanal, he said.</p>
      <p>To facilitate tax payment through UPI, HDMC is holding parleys with Bharat Bills. It will also tie up with Canara Bank and National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI). This apart, a suggestion has been mooted in the government to arrange for issuing birth certificates at the H-D One centres instead of at the municipal office, he said.</p>
      <p>About waste management, Mr. Itnal said that work on a CND waste treatment plant at Shivalli village would be completed by March. Similarly, two compost manufacturing plants — one each at Hubballi and Dharwad — would come up by December, he said.</p>
