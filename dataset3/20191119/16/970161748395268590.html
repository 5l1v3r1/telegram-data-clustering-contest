      <p>A chip shop owner has been acquitted of killing his wife by throwing a pan of boiling oil over her.</p>
      <p>Geoffrey Bran, 71, was accused of murdering Mavis Bran, his wife of 38 years, after she ‘nagged him’ at the chippy they owned together.</p>
      <p>She was horrifically burned and died six days later, but Mr Bran told a jury she had accidentally tipped the oil over herself.</p>
      <p>Before she died, she had told a friend: ‘Geoff has thrown boiling oil over me. Please get here, I need you now, help.’</p>
      <p>A court heard she told her: ‘I was nagging him and he flipped.’</p>
      <p>Mrs Bran was taken by air ambulance to the burns unit at Morriston Hospital in Swansea but died of multiple organ failure.</p>

      <p>Mr Bran was initially arrested on suspicion of assault and denied attacking his wife, telling police: ‘She got burned with the chip fryer. She slipped and it came off the top and went over her. Don’t ask.’</p>
      <p>It happened at the Chipoteria chip shop in the rural village of Hermon, Carmarthenshire on October 23 last year.</p>
      <p>Mrs Bran died in hospital after suffering burns to 46% of her body, after developing sepsis and hypothermia and undergoing surgery to remove some of her burned skin.</p>
      <p>Lodger Gareth Davies told the court Mrs Bran returned to her home naked from the waist up with ‘crimson’ peeling skin around 1pm on October 23 last year, shouting ‘I’ve been burned’ and ‘I’ve had boiling hot fat all over me’.</p>

      <p>Mr and Mrs Bran, who had no children together, owned around 10 businesses around South Wales, including the Chipoteria which opened in January 2018 in a cabin situated next to their home in the small West Wales village.</p>
      <p>The court heard that financial pressures of their various businesses would sometimes put a strain on their marriage, leading to arguments about money.</p>
      <p>People who knew the couple were said to have described them as having ‘short tempers’ and ‘always argued, swearing and shouting at each other’.</p>
      <p>In the months leading up to her death, a friend of Mrs Bran had noticed the couple’s relationship had been ‘deteriorating’, with Mrs Bran phoning friend Miss Morgan in tears saying ‘he’s getting nasty’.</p>

      <p>Mr Bran claimed his wife had previously spread lies about him, and suggested she was ‘halfway’ to being drunk on the afternoon she was injuries after drinking glasses of red wine.</p>
      <p>Paramedics found she had a blood alcohol reading of 108 mg/dl, higher than the drink-drive limit of 80mg/dl.</p>
      <p>Mr Bran said his wife must have been ‘confused’ when blaming him but said he ‘couldn’t find an answer’ as to why he then ignored her for more than two hours after she was hurt.</p>
      <p>He told the court he loved and missed his wife, despite telling police in an interview: ‘It’s a miracle we lasted that long. But we used to get on OK. We’ve had our ups and downs.’</p>
      <p>Outside court, Mr Bran stood next to a family spokesman as she read out a statement asking that they be allowed to ‘get on with our lives’.</p>
      <p>The spokeswoman said: ‘As a family we would just like to say thank you to everybody who has supported us in the last year. Family, friends and our legal team who have shown great compassion, professionalism, and positivity over this trying time.</p>
      <p>‘The loss of Mavis has left the family devastated and we ask that we can now get on with our lives and grieve properly without further intrusion.’</p>
