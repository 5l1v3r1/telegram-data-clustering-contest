      <p>The latest <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/cats-movie/">Cats</a> trailer was released this afternoon and sorry to say but while it’s seemingly brilliant in all its musicality – it’s going to haunt your dreams.</p>
      <p>But, like, in a good way? We think?</p>
      <p>Punters caught a better glimpse of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/taylor-swift/">Taylor Swift</a> and James Corden, as well as Idris Elba as furry felines when the latest clip landed on Twitter on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The film will follow the tale of the Jellicle cats as they hold the ball for Old Deuteronomy (Dame Judi Dench) will pick which feline to take to the Heaviside Layer and onto a better life.</p>

      <p>While the original trailer scared the children with the first look at what Taylor would look like as a cat, we were blessed to hear Jennifer Hudson sing the beautiful Memory, made famous by her character Grizabella and we already have goosebumps.</p>
      <p>Tom Hooper, the man behind The King’s Speech, Les Misérables, The Danish Girl, just to name a few Hollywood epics, has taken the reins on Andrew Lloyd Webber’s stage musical to bring it to the big screen all for little ol’ us.</p>
