      <h1>Al Sharpton Says NFL’s Demands Were ‘Insulting’ To Colin Kaepernick, Fans, &amp; American People (VIDEO)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:55:44+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:55</time> by <a rel="author">Darrelle Lincoln</a></address>
      <p>Colin Kaepernick “did the right thing” when he decided to suddenly chance workout venues from the Atlanta Falcons practice facility to a local high school, Rev. Al Sharpton said to TMZ.</p>
      <p>Sharpton defended Kaepernick over a waiver the league wanted him to sign before participating at the workout, with Kaepernick’s camp believing the language on the injury portion waiver should’ve been narrowed.</p>
      <p>“I think Kaepernick handled it right,” Sharpton told TMZ Sports. “To have to be told that you’re gonna have to sign some waivers and limit the media is absolutely insulting.”</p>

      <p>Sharpton added: “He is being penalized for standing up for the rights of people, standing up for criminal justice and to try and reduce him to some kind of photo op for the NFL is something that is antithetical for what he stood for and is insulting to the fans and is insulting to the intelligence of the American people.”</p>
      <p>He continued by stating he was happy that Kaepernick exposed the NFL’s so-called “hypocrisy.”</p>
      <p>After his workout, the former 49ers QB had something to say.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been ready for three years,” Kaepernick said. “I’ve been denied for three years. We all know why. I came out here today and showed it in front of everybody. We have nothing to hide. We’re waiting for the 32 owners, the 32 teams, [NFL Commissioner] Roger Goodell, all of them to stop running, stop running from the truth, stop running from the people.”</p>
