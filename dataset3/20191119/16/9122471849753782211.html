      <h1>How Much The Blazers Are Reportedly Paying Carmelo Anthony</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:33:47+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:33</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>After missing almost all of last season, Carmelo Anthony is officially back in the NBA. He’s now a member of the Portland Trail Blazers.</p>
      <p>The Houston Rockets cut ties with Anthony 10 games into the season. Rumors swirled about where he’d play next, but there wasn’t a team willing to sign him during the year.</p>
      <p>Once the offseason went by with Anthony unsigned, the thought around the league was that he might not receive another opportunity.</p>
      <p>Fortunately for Anthony, the Trail Blazers decided to sign the veteran forward in an effort to upgrade their frontcourt.</p>
      <p>According to NBA insider Shams Charania, the Blazers will pay Anthony $2.15 million if he remains on the roast past a guaranteed date in January.</p>
      <p>Since he passed his physical exam, Anthony is officially on the roster today.</p>

      <p>Anthony will wear No. 00 with the Trail Blazers, which is pretty unusual.</p>
      <p>Before the season, Anthony was on ESPN’s <i>First Take</i> to discuss how he feels about not being in the NBA. He made it abundantly clear that he’ll accept any role on a roster, which is something he didn’t want to do back then with the Oklahoma City Thunder.</p>
      <p>Portland hasn’t announced when Anthony will make his season debut, but all eyes will be on the future Hall of Famer when he makes his first appearance with the team.</p>
