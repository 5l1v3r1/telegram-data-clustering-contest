      <p>It is the first TV debate of the campaign - with further events set to be broadcast on Sky and the BBC in the coming weeks.</p>
      <h3>What channel is it on? Can I stream it?</h3>
      <p>The hour-long showdown will be broadcast on ITV1 from 8pm, with a live stream available on the  <a href="http://www.itv.com/hub/itv">ITV Hub</a>  for UK-based viewers.</p>

      <p>Both leaders will stand behind podiums to deliver a minute-long statement before the debate, followed by a closing statement of 45 seconds.</p>
      <p>The Labour leader has chosen to speak first, after Labour and the Conservatives drew lots to see who would open the debate.</p>
      <h3>What time does it start?</h3>
      <p>The ITV leaders debate will kick off at 8pm and will last for one hour until 9pm.</p>
      <p>The event will take place at the MediaCityUK studios in Salford, in front of an audience of about 200 people.</p>
