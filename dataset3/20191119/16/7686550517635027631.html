        <figcaption>An awful smell from a Swansea tip is now affecting a large area and people say it's getting worse</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>A strong stench suspected to be coming from a disused tip near <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/pontardawe">Pontardawe</a> , <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/swansea">Swansea</a> , is reportedly spreading over a wider area.</p>
      <p>The source of the smell is thought to be Pwllfawatkin tip in Abernant Road, between Cwmgors and Pontardawe, and has been an ongoing issue for people living in the area for years, as <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/local-news/neath-talbot-recycling-centre-pontardawe-17109369">reported last month</a> .</p>
      <p>People are also now complaining of headaches and asthma symptoms they believe are linked to the odour.</p>
      <p>During the recent poor weather, the smell has reportedly become stronger and is being picked up further away from the tip site.</p>
      <p>A Facebook group set up to pool complaints about the intrusive smell has people from Gellinudd, Craig-Cefn-Parc, Rhiwfawr, Gaun-Cae-Gurwen and as far as seven miles away from the tip in Brynamman, commenting about having smelled the sulphurous stench, with many saying it's getting worse.</p>
      <p>Neath Port Talbot Council said it had received a number of complaints and Natural Resources Wales said it was investigating the source.</p>
      <p>"It's been a problem for at least a decade. It's all to do with the weather, if you've got a breeze that comes down the valley you get a putrid smell, like a gassy smell," said Arwyn Morgan, who lives in Pontardawe.</p>
      <p>"I have been in contact with Neath Port Talbot Council about it years ago but nothing ever changed."</p>

      <p>Sue Fulcher, a foster carer from Parc Gilbertson, Pontardawe, said: "I drive towards Ammanford on the road past the tip at Abernant a lot and there is no way of getting away from the smell.</p>
      <p>"It's a rotten veg smell, last night it smelled like gas.</p>
      <p>"It makes my asthma flare up too which isn't helpful. My chest goes tight and the affect lasts for hours, with my breathing, it isn't easy to fix once it flares."</p>
      <p>People further down the valley in low-lying areas seem to be taking a bigger hit from the unwelcome smell.</p>
      <p>Theresa Mudge bought her house in Waun Gron, Rhyd-Y-Fro, about four miles away from the tip, just over a year ago.</p>

        <figcaption>Theresa Mudge has been woken up by the smell at its worst<cite>(Image: www.adrianwhitephotography.co.uk)</cite></figcaption>

      <p>"The morning and the nights are the worst. I would describe the smell as 'vile', I don't know how else to describe it, 'eggy' doesn't even cover it.</p>
      <p>"I love my house and I don't want to move, but I'm waking up with a headache every morning."</p>
      <p>"Because I'm a carer, and you smell certain things in the job, I have learned to breathe through my mouth, but I never expected to have to do that in my own home," she said.</p>

      <p>Mrs Mudge moved from Bracknell, Berkshire, for her husband to take a job at a housing development in Swansea, but the contract fell through and he has now moved back to England for work.</p>
      <p>Their three children, Aston, 20, Michael, 16 and Amy, 8, live with their mum in Pontardawe and have all complained of headaches because of the smell. Sometimes it is so bad that it wakes them up during the night.</p>
      <p>The family have to keep doors and windows closed, and use fans in the summer to cool the house, as they can't open the windows.</p>

      <p>When it snowed, Mrs Mudge opened her front door to admire the scene of the Upper Clydach River from her front door but 'heaved' because of the aroma.</p>
      <p>"I don't want to leave here, I moved because we have a waterfall on our doorstep and the lovely woods and really, we can't afford to move again now anyway," she added.</p>
      <p>Not everyone has noticed the smell, though.</p>
      <p>Alan James, who lives in Rhyd-Y-Fro with his wife, Betty, said: "I can't smell anything to be honest with you. I've seen it all on social media but maybe I just haven't got a very good sense of smell. We've lived here for years and never had any problems."</p>

      <p>A spokesman for Neath Port Talbot Council said: “We have received a number of complaints regarding odour from the site which we are investigating with the landfill site management company in accordance with the Environmental Protection Act.</p>
      <p>"Natural Resources Wales are responsible for regulating the site in terms of compliance with their environmental permit, and as such we have notified them of the issue. We are not yet aware of the source of the odour as our investigations are ongoing.”</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Natural Resources Wales said it had also been notified of the complaints.</p>
      <p>"We are aware of the situation and are investigating the source of the odour,” he said.</p>
