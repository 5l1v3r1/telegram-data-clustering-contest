      <p>Elton John was joined by his husband David Furnish as he returned to The Royal Academy of Music, in London.</p>
      <p>The duo are making a whistlestop visit to the UK, where they will be promoting the Honky Cat hitmaker’s autobiography Me: Elton John.</p>
      <p>And while they enjoyed their time in the capital, it seems they couldn’t resist paying a visit to the icon’s old school.</p>
      <p>When he was just 11-years-old, the musician won a scholarship as a Junior Exhibitor at the institution and would go there on Saturday mornings for the next four years.</p>
      <p>But despite leaving to fulfill his dream of being in a band, he was later awarded an honorary doctorate from the prestigious school, in 2002.</p>

      <p>Elton’s appearance came shortly after he <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/elton-john-had-to-learn-how-to-walk-again-after-being-stuck-down-with-serious-infection-amid-cancer-battle-11178642/">opened up about his terrifying near-death experience that saw him having to learn how to walk again.</a></p>
      <p>During his battle with prostate cancer, the Rocketman had a build up of fluid under his colon, which left him in excruciating pain and needing to wear a nappy on stage as he performed in Las Vegas in 2017.</p>
      <p>In a new interview, the singer explained how he was ’24 hours from snuffing it’ and had to relearn how to walk as part of his recovery.</p>

      <p>He also joked that he was ‘like the Bionic Woman’ as he has had his tonsils, colon and appendix removed.</p>
      <p>Talking on the BBC One documentary Uncensored, Elton said: ‘I went to South America and played in Santiago and I came home, and I got to London and I was very ill. And I was rushed into hospital on intensive care.</p>
      <p>‘I picked up an awful bug from somewhere. And I was about 24 hours from snuffing it. We didn’t tell people that was going on at the time, so I had an annus horribilis as they say for half the year.</p>
      <p>‘I literally had to learn how to walk again. I was extremely sick. All I could think about when I was lying in my hospital bed was “please don’t let me die, I want to see my children”, and luckily I survived it.</p>

      <p>‘Now I’m fine but there’s very few bits of me left. There’s no hair, there’s a pacemaker, there’s no tonsils, there’s no prostate, there’s no appendix, I’ve had kidney stones. I’m like the Bionic Woman.’</p>
