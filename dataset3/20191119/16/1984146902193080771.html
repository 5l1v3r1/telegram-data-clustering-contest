      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:39:39+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:39</time> by <a rel="author">Kali Lindsay, Shivali Best</a></address>
      <p>The UK coastal towns and cities most at risk of being wiped out in the next 20 years have been revealed - and one is in the North East.</p>
      <p>A new <a href="https://www.confused.com/home-insurance/living-on-the-edge">interactive map</a> has revealed which sites are at risk over the next 20, 50 and 100 years.</p>
      <p>Land near Sunderland Docks could be one of the first areas to feel the effects of coastal erosion.</p>
      <p>With 40 metres of coast expected to be lost in the next 20 years, 100m in 50 years and 200 metres in 100 years.</p>
      <p>The map was developed by confused.com using data from the Environmental Agency, which predicts the shocking speed of erosion on England’s coastline.</p>
      <p>It suggests that a whopping 7,000 homes will fall into the sea within this century, and highlights four key areas at risk.</p>
      <p>Tom Vaughan, head of home at Confused.com said: “Coastal erosion has become one of the  most worrying issues for UK homeowners in seaside towns. Our research highlights the increasing risk that many coastal residents are facing, to the point where some are ultimately looking at losing their homes over the next 20 years.</p>
      <p>“Homes on the coastline have always been popular, especially in the likes of Yorkshire and East England where views are second to none.”</p>
