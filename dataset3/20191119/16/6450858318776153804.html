      <h1>Best Early Black Friday Electric Toothbrush Deals</h1>
      <h2>Electric toothbrushes are some of the worst products around for inflated pricing, so it's always worth learning how to find a good toothbrush deal to make sure you're really saving money</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:45:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:45</time> by <a rel="author">Dominic Preston</a></address>
      <p>There are few products that are priced as strangely as electric toothbrushes, which are routinely available for less than half their RRP in the UK - even just days after they've come out. That pricing structure makes buying an electric or smart toothbrush confusing at the best of times, and it only gets worse during sales seasons like Black Friday and Prime Day, as it can be almost impossible to tell what's a real discount, and what's just designed to look like one.</p>
      <p>That's where we come in. We test and review smart and electric toothbrushes year-round (check out our <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/test-centre/digital-home/best-electric-toothbrush-3652376/">best electric toothbrush chart</a> to see our current recommendations), which means we know how much these brushes <i>actually</i> cost normally - not just how much retailers want you to think they're worth.</p>
      <p>We'll only recommend deals that we think are genuine savings off the regular price, not just the ones that look like savings. Some retailers actually <i>raise</i> prices on <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/feature/internet/black-friday-2019-3661756/">Black Friday</a> and <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/feature/gadget/best-cyber-monday-deals-3667890/">Cyber Monday</a> and trust that the 'discount' percentage will trick you into thinking it's a bargain, so the unwary could actually spend more when they think they're spending less. We'll watch out for those traps so you don't have to.</p>
      <p><b>Please note</b> that in all of the deals on this page, we've listed the original price as what the brush <i>actually</i> sells for, rather than the inflated RRP. So any saving you see here is the real saving you're making compared to buying the same brush normally. </p>

      <p>It usually costs around £220 to get this twin pack of Sonicare 4300 brush handles, so at £144 they're a steal</p>
      <h4>2. Philips Sonicare ProtectiveClean 6100</h4>

      </p>
      <p>Normally £125, we reckon the Sonicare 6100 is the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/digital-home/philips-sonicare-protectiveclean-6100-3683586/">best toothbrush you can buy right now</a> and this is a decent price for it.</p>
      <h4>3. Oral-B Genius 9000</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/deal/3686313/81goagzf_hl__sl1500__thumb450.jpg"/>

      </p>
      <p>Ignore the £300 RRP – this brush is normally £138, making Amazon's current price a good saving. <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/digital-home/oral-b-genius-8000-9000-review-3652362/">Read our review</a>.</p>
      <h4>4. Philips Sonicare ProtectiveClean 4300</h4>

      </p>
      <p>This Philips mid-range brush usually costs around £80, so you're saving roughly £20 with this deal from Amazon. However, we have seen it go for less, so we imagine that this price will drop back down for Black Friday.</p>
      <h4>5. Oral-B Genius 8000 CrossAction Electric Toothbrush</h4>

      </p>
      <p>The Oral-B Genius 8000 is usually £120 (ignore the £279.99 RRP at Amazon, it's never that price), so this is a great offer - we gave the brush <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/health-beauty/oral-b-genius-8000-9000-review-3652362/">4.5 stars out of 5</a> in our review.</p>
      <h4>6. Oral-B SmartSeries 7000 CrossAction Electric Toothbrush</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/deal/3688538/oral-b-smartseries-7000_thumb450.jpg"/>

      </p>
      <p>This brush is usually around £150, making this price a steal</p>
      <h4>7. Philips Sonicare ProtectiveClean 5100</h4>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/cmsdata/deal/3686321/philips-sonicare-5100_thumb450.jpg"/>

      </p>
      <p>The £280 RRP is nonsense. This is a £100 brush, but you can save £25 off the usual price for now.</p>
      <h4>8. Oral-B Pro 650</h4>
      <figure>

      </p>
      <p>This brush is normally around £30 making this a solid price.</p>
      <h3>Electric toothbrush discounts: What to look for</h3>
      <p>Before we get to the details of deals, you need to know what to actually look for in an electric toothbrush in the first place.</p>
      <h4>Types of electric toothbrush</h4>
      <p>First up, there are a lot of terms that get thrown about to describe different types of electric toothbrush, but you can basically fit most of them into two categories.</p>
      <p>First up are mechanical brushes, which you might also see described as rotating, oscillating, pulsing, or some other variation on the above. These tend to be at the cheaper end of the spectrum, and work by rotating (or oscillating, or pulsing) the bristles on the brush head to remove plaque and clean teeth. Brushes that only rotate tend to be the least effective, so look out for ones that pulse or use counter-oscillating (moving some bristles one way, and some the other simultaneously) for a better clean.</p>
      <p>The second broad type of brushes are sonic brushes. These vibrate rather than rotate, the idea being that they hit certain specific frequencies that break down plaque and help to drive toothpaste between your teeth. <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/digital-home/philips-sonicare-protectiveclean-6100-3683586/">Philips Sonicare brushes</a> are the best-known examples of this.</p>
      <p>Finally, there are a few more recent brushes in a third category, but they're much less common: ionic brushes. We've reviewed the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/digital-home/sanyei-ion-sei-review-3686161/">Sanyei Ion-Sei</a>, which claims to use a UV LED to generate ions to stop bacteria from growing in your mouth in the first place. It's a promising idea, but still early days, and so it's far from widespread - which means it's hard right now to judge if it's anything more than marketing hype.</p>
      <h4>Smart toothbrushes</h4>
      <p>More and more toothbrushes are now boasting smart features like Bluetooth and app support, with a few even claiming to be 'AI toothbrushes'. Take all of this with a pinch of salt - but still, the companion apps for some brushes can be a great way to improve your brushing technique or monitor your child's.</p>
      <p>Different brushes handle it in different ways, but the core functionality of most apps is to monitor where in your mouth you're brushing the most (and the least) and give you tips on how to give yourself a more thorough clean. The <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/digital-home/oral-b-genius-8000-9000-review-3652362/">Oral-B Genius 9000</a> does this in a slightly awkward way by using your phone's camera to monitor your brushing, but newer brushes like the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/digital-home/kolibree-ara-smart-toothbrush-review-3662470/">Kolibree Ara</a> use built-in sensors to detect the brush's position in your mouth.</p>
      <p>Most also include games which make them ideal for kids. These might encourage kids to move the brush to a new spot in their mouth to collect coins or something similar, teaching them good brushing technique in a way that's a bit more entertaining than usual. As you'd expect, there'll also be all sorts of stats tracked so you can monitor your progress and how often you brush.</p>
      <h4>Other features</h4>
      <p>Even if an app doesn't appeal, there are a few other key features you might want to look out for in a brush. The big one is probably a pressure sensor: this allows the brush to alert you (either with a light or a change in the vibrations) when you're pressing down too hard with the brush, potentially damaging your teeth and gums.</p>
      <p>The next concern is a brush timer. If you haven't bought an app-enabled brush, you'll want this so that it alerts you every 30 seconds or so to move onto the next section of your mouth, making sure that you a) clean your whole mouth, and b) brush for long enough.</p>
      <p>Finally, look for brushes with multiple speeds - especially if you have sensitive teeth - as these will allow you to adjust the power to suit your preferences. That's especially useful if you'll be sharing the brush with other family members (though please remember to get your own brush heads!).</p>
      <h4>Battery life</h4>
      <p>Battery might not be an obvious concern when it comes to a toothbrush, but if you don't have a convenient charging socket in your bathroom than it could make a massive difference to quality of life. A long enough battery life will also save you from worrying about bringing the charger with you on holiday.</p>
      <p>Top brushes should last a couple of weeks of daily use, and we wouldn't recommend buying anything that won't run for at least a week when used twice daily. For added convenience some modern brushes will charge by USB, which at least gives you more options for topping them up while travelling, and might compensate for a lower battery life.</p>
      <h4>Replacement brush heads</h4>
      <p>Finally, brush heads. There are two elements to this. First up, what sort of choice of brush heads do you get? With a big brand like Philips or Oral-B, odds are you'll be able to choose between brush heads designed specifically for whitening, gum care, sensitive teeth, or more. With a smaller brand, you're likely to be more limited.</p>
      <p>Price is also a big factor here. Expensive as the brush itself may be, if it lasts for a while the bigger cost could end up being replacement brush heads. Again, the big brands have the edge here: thanks to bulk they can sell brush heads for less, and you can usually find third-party replacements for even less. Smaller brands like Kolibree and Sanyei just can't compete here. </p>
      <p>So before you snap up a cheap brush, make sure you won't pay for it later when it comes to buying new brush heads.</p>
      <h3>Where to find smart toothbrush savings</h3>
      <p>As with most things, Amazon is one of the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/electric-toothbrushes-sonicare-braun/?ascsubtag=06-3686261-11-0000000">best places to look for toothbrush deals</a> first, especially if you look in the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/deals/ref=nav_cs_gb?ascsubtag=06-3686261-11-0000000">Deals of the Day</a>. These discounts offered for a limited time (often for a few hours only), or until stocks run out - they're also known as Lightning Deals.</p>
      <p>We'd recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/prime/pipeline/landing?ascsubtag=06-3686261-11-0000000">signing up to Amazon's 30 day free trial of Prime</a>, which will not only get you access to <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/deals?ascsubtag=06-3686261-11-0000000">Lightning deals</a> 30 minutes earlier than non-Prime members, but will also get you free next-day delivery. Plus, you'll get access to Prime Video, which you can access through your smart TV, and other benefits during your trial, too.</p>
