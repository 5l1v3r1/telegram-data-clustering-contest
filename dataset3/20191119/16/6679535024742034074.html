      <p>A woman filed a complaint under the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act 2019 against her husband for pronouncing instant talaq by verbally uttering it thrice.</p>
      <p>According to a complaint lodged with the Udupi Women Police Station here, the complainant, Sajida Ashraf (41), said that she and the accused, Ashraf Mohammed Bapu (44), were married on May 20, 1997 at Kudroli mosque as per Islamic traditions. The couple have two children.</p>
      <p>The accused used to always mentally and physically torment Sajida Ashraf since marriage, the complainant said. Ashraf’s elder brother harassed her. When she brought this matter to the notice of Ashraf, the latter told her that her conduct was improper and beat her with a belt, she added.</p>
      <p>On November 17, 2019 when Ashraf came home at 9.30 a.m., she asked him where he was for the last 10 days. To that, Ashraf told her that he had gone to Samina’s house and had married her. He then verbally uttered talaq thrice and used abusive language against her, assaulted and threatened her, Ms. Ashraf said in the complaint.</p>
      <p>A case has been registered under Sections 498A, 323, 504, 506, 354A of Indian Penal Code and Section 4 of Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act 2019 based on Ms. Ashraf’s complaint at the women police station here on Monday.</p>
      <p>The police arrested Ashraf based on his wife’s complaint and produced him before a court here on Tuesday. The court granted him bail.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Ashraf’s elder brother has gone absconding and efforts are on to trace him, the police said.</p>
