        <b>Dillian Whyte says his next fight will take place on 7 December, with a "strong possibility" of being on the undercard of Anthony Joshua's rematch against Andy Ruiz in Saudi Arabia.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Heavyweight Whyte last fought in July, when <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/boxing/49060470">he beat</a> Oscar Rivas on points.</p>
      <p>Whyte, 31, tested positive for a banned substance before the bout but was cleared to take part, while the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBofC) told BBC Sport he is "not suspended".</p>
      <p>No opponent has yet been named.</p>
      <p>Asked whether Whyte could appear on the Joshua-Ruiz undercard, promoter Eddie Hearn said on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9xLDt8YXss">iFL TV podcast</a> last week: "It has gone from a possibility to a strong possibility.</p>
      <p>"We are seeing whether we can make it happen but there is a very good chance it will be on that card."</p>
      <p>Whyte <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/boxing/49210120">passed all tests </a>with the Voluntary Anti-Doping Association (Vada) in the build-up and aftermath of his bout with Colombia's Rivas, but gave an adverse test with UK Anti-Doping (Ukad) in the run up to his win on 20 July.</p>
      <p>He was notified of the test result on 17 July but cleared to fight by an independent panel on the day of the bout.</p>
      <p>On 30 July, the WBC provisionally suspended Whyte's status as the organisation's interim world heavyweight champion and mandatory challenger to Deontay Wilder.</p>
      <p>The BBBofC added that there were "ongoing procedures" but made it clear Whyte was not suspended, while Ukad said it could not comment on ongoing investigations.</p>
