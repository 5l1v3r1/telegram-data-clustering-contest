      <p>BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary’s Parliament will begin discussing on Wednesday a bill that restricts its members’ freedom of action, a ruling party proposal that has led to renewed accusations of authoritarianism on the part of Prime Minister Viktor Orban.</p>

      <p>Under the bill, MPs will no longer be able to show up unannounced at public institutions or government-owned companies and demand documents, losing an element of surprise.</p>
      <p>Breaking house protocol will carry penalties of up to 60 days’ exclusion from parliamentary premises and loss of up to 12 months of pay.</p>
      <p>The bill is another instance of Orban’s ruling party, Fidesz, tightening its hold on Hungary, a process that has been going on for a decade. The European Union has investigated rule of law concerns in Hungary and could suspend the country’s EU voting rights.</p>
      <p>MPs critical of the government say the bill is a further erosion of democratic checks and balances.</p>
      <p>“This is clearly a rights violation for MPs,” independent MP Akos Hadhazy, a vocal anti-corruption advocate, told Reuters. “They don’t strip us of our rights: they strip millions of citizens that we represent.”</p>
      <p>At the 2018 parliament elections, 2.8 million Hungarians voted for Fidesz and 2.9 million for other groups. Hungary’s population is just under 10 million.</p>
      <p>Orban and Fidesz have denied exerting outsized control, pointing to three general election victories and a two-thirds majority in parliament.</p>
      <p>Fidesz’s hold on power may be weakening, though. Major cities — including the capital, Budapest — handed power to an opposition alliance in municipal elections last month.</p>
      <p>The bill’s proponents say it’s intended to preserve Parliament’s honour and efficiency, not stifle criticism. But Fidesz group leader Mate Kocsis posted the news on Facebook, adding: “Anarchists, attention! Parliament violence and obscenity will be penalized.”</p>
      <p>The comments come after Hadhazy held up signs during a recent Orban speech in Parliament, including: “He must lie to cover up all his thieving.”</p>
      <p>Orban, whose family and friends have been among the greatest beneficiaries of public procurement and saw their wealth skyrocket in the past decade, has consistently denied having any business interests.</p>
      <p>Bernadett Szel, another independent opposition MP, called the bill “a brutal attack on opposition politics and parties in Hungary ... But an abuse of power is never a sign of strength; on the contrary: one of weakness.”</p>
