      <p>Ashley Graham is bringing one of the biggest fashion trends back from the early 2000s.</p>
      <p>On Monday, the mom-to-be visited the SiriusXM Studios in New York City wearing a stunning maternity look. She wore a brown cardigan over a matching knit dress, which had a scoop-style neckline and long skirt. The bottom of her dress also featured a short slit across her left leg.</p>
      <p>To match her autumnal fashion, Graham also donned black thigh-high boots, gold necklaces, and neutral makeup.</p>

      <p>Though it looks high quality, Graham’s recent ensemble doesn’t cost as much as some might assume.</p>
      <p>At the time of writing, her two-piece ensemble is available <a href="https://www.freepeople.com/shop/phoebe-set/?category=dresses&amp;amp;color=022">at Free People for $148</a>. Her Sam Edelman heels, however, are bit more pricey, <a href="https://www.samedelman.com/en-US/Product/EC0232038-3018462/Sam+Edelman/Black+Suede/Hai+Knee+High+Boot.aspx">retailing for $200</a>.</p>
      <p>And while Graham’s outfit looks entirely modern, it actually features a nod to the early 2000s. Throughout the early aughts, button-up cardigans <a href="https://www.insider.com/2000s-fashion-trends-coming-back-2019-10#button-up-cardigans-are-making-a-comeback-2">were a staple in many wardrobes</a>. The garments were typically worn over camisole tank tops, though some people also wore them as tops.</p>
      <p>Now, they’re coming back in style. Even <a href="https://www.insider.com/photos-of-celebrities-wearing-2000s-fashion-2019-10#bella-hadid-also-wore-a-2000s-inspired-look-that-same-month-11">Bella Hadid wore a cropped cardigan</a> while out in New York City last month.</p>

      <h3>Graham’s knit dress is one of the most casual maternity outfits she’s worn throughout her pregnancy</h3>
      <p>Just days prior, the model showcased her style <a href="https://www.insider.com/ashley-graham-custom-maternity-dress-2019-11">in a sleeveless form-fitting gown</a> at the the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund Awards.</p>
      <p>She wore a Christopher John Rogers dress, which was sleeveless with a ruched ankle-length skirt. It also had a purple-and-green hue, which created a duo-chrome effect.</p>

      <p>Even earlier on Halloween, she slipped into a <a href="https://www.insider.com/pregnant-ashley-graham-dressed-as-jessica-rabbit-for-halloween-2019-10">latex Jessica Rabbit costume</a> that was custom-made for her. She shared photos of the look, which also included purple latex gloves, on Instagram.</p>

      <p>She also experimented with a <a href="https://www.insider.com/ashley-graham-sheer-maternity-dress-rihanna-fenty-fashion-show-2019-9">maternity leotard</a> in September. She wore the strapless garment underneath a sheer maternity dress while attending <a href="https://www.insider.com/rihanna-savage-x-fenty-show-versus-victorias-secret-2019-9">the 2019 Savage X Fenty fashion show</a> in New York City.</p>
