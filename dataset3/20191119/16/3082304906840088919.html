        <b>The top of the table clash between Iraq and Bahrain in Group C of the 2022 FIFA World Cup Qualifiers have ended in a goalless draw at the Amman International Stadium in Jordan on Tuesday.</b>

      <p>While the Iraqis were coming into the game on the back of a dramatic win over early favourites IR Iran last week, <a href="https://www.foxsportsasia.com/football/asian-football/fifa-wc-asian-qualifiers/1186020/iran-pay-the-penalty-as-bahrain-claim-upset-to-move-joint-top-with-iraq/">Bahrain had also created an upset of <i>Team Melli</i> last month</a> putting them only two points behind group leaders Iraq.</p>
      <p>However, the game which was moved to a neutral venue from Iraq lacked in creativity as both the sides played with caution and ended the game with zero shots on target splitting the points among them in the process.</p>

      <p>The two sides had played out a 1-1 draw in Riffa in their qualifiers opener back in September.</p>
      <p><i>The Lions of Mesopotamia</i> remain top of the group with 11 points after five matches while Bahrain are second with nine points. Iran are third with six points from four matches and will have a mountain to climb when the World Cup Qualifiers resume in March 2020.</p>
