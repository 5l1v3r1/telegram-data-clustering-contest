      <p>The worlds of film and TV have always felt like cousins that, at the best of times, know how to share things rather well. Marvel Studios is counting on such sharing to lead to the future of their Marvel Cinematic Universe being <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2482447/the-incredible-amount-of-money-disney-is-spending-on-disney-marvel-and-star-wars-shows">an even richer era</a> of content, as several Disney+ shows planned by the company will draw characters from the movies into the world of streaming series. But one character you’ll never see in that sort of arrangement is Chadwick Boseman’s <i>Black Panther</i> lead, King T’Challa.</p>
      <p>During a recent interview for his new film <i>21 Bridges</i>, Boseman was asked who he’s pair up with for another Marvel adventure. And sensing <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2484608/marvels-falcon-and-winter-soldier-series-unveils-new-character-looks-and-first-peek-at-us-agent">a hint of <i>The Falcon and Winter Soldier</i></a> in the hypothetical air, he laughed and responded thusly:</p>
      <blockquote>I wouldn't, because I don't want to do a TV show.</blockquote>
      <p>Chadwick Boseman even took his response a step further, and said that out of the things he was really excited to be a part of in the future, none of them were franchises. Somewhere, in the offices of Disney and Marvel Studios, someone’s feelings have probably been hurt. If you can hear someone playing Taylor Swift’s <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2484934/hear-taylor-swifts-new-song-from-cats">“Beautiful Ghosts” from <i>Cats</i></a>, you’ll know who needs a hug.</p>
      <p>With the MCU more than likely expanding itself to <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481231/should-4-mcu-movies-a-year-be-standard-after-2021">four movies a year</a>, and presumably three Disney+ shows a year, that’s a lot of content that’s going to be coming to fans in the coming years. One such film in that canon just happens to be <i>Black Panther 2</i>, which sees director Ryan Coogler coming back to Marvel Studios, for a film that’s slated for release in May 2022. But as that project is still in <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2481441/bummer-black-panther-2-hasnt-really-started-coming-together-yet">a slight state of flux</a>, that might be why Chadwick Boseman isn’t excited for his own franchise just yet.</p>
      <p>It’s certainly a bold statement for someone to put out there to an outlet like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPXFvAZKToc&amp;feature=emb_title">MTV International</a>, as fans of Boseman’s performance as T’Challa will probably want as much as they can get from his memorable character. However, there is always the chance that, like any good Marvel Studios employee, Chadwick Boseman is playing the long con and throwing folks off the scent with some misinformation.</p>
      <p>Stranger things have happened in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and it would be a pleasant surprise to tune into a future episode of something like <i>What If…</i> or <i>WandaVision</i> and see Boseman’s king of Wakanda strutting out to save the day. <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2476521/robert-downey-jr-talks-distancing-himself-from-iron-man-and-the-mcu">We certainly didn’t expect</a> Robert Downey Jr. to be returning anytime soon, <a href="https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2484922/robert-downey-jr-is-reportedly-returning-as-iron-man-for-disney">and look what happened there</a>!</p>
      <p>At the moment, you’ll next be able to see Chadwick Boseman on the silver screen in his latest film, <i>21 Bridges</i>, which is in theaters now. As far as Disney+ is concerned, you can catch Boseman’s work in the various Marvel films he’s starred in, including <i>Avengers: Endgame</i>, on the streaming platform. And if you don’t have a subscription that allows you to do that just yet, you can get a 7-day free trial of the service. You can <a href="https://www.disneyplus.com/welcome/bundle?irclickid=zB838%3A0lpxyOTzI05-R4sULoUkn1Jzw6hykszU0&amp;irgwc=1&amp;cid=DSS-Affiliate-Impact-Content-Gateway%20Blend%20LLC-705874">check out more about the trial deal here</a> and follow the sign-up procedure for your own gateway into Disney+ goodness.</p>
