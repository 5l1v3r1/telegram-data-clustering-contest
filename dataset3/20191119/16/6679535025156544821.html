      <p>Yoga guru Baba Ramdev said on Tuesday that the government should take steps to control population growth in the country, including taking away voting rights of those who produce more children.</p>
      <p>Speaking at Sant Sangam (a congregation of seers and sants) here, Ramdev said that the country already had a huge population, but the resources were limited. Hence, a law for population control was essential.</p>
      <p>“Some people keep on producing children. They have five to 10 children. Some don’t even know how many children they have. Take away the voting rights of those who produce more children and also the voting rights of those children as well,” he said.</p>
      <p>People should produce fewer children so that they could give quality education and facilities to them. “The people of India should be as much respected in the world as the people of Israel are,” Ramdev said.</p>
