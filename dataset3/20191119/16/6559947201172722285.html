      <p>With <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/advertising-content/118221/black-friday-2018-everything-you-need-to-know-and-where-to-f">Black Friday</a> just around the corner, we expected the older <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/advertising-content/118542/cyber-monday-2018-best-uk-headphone-deals">Apple AirPod models</a> to receive favourable discounts.</p>
      <p>However, it is in fact the <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/bdx2?or=https%3A%2F%2Fuk.icms.pcmag.com%2Fadmin%2Farticle%2F123646%2F1%2F%3Finline">latest model</a> that has been discounted on Amazon. If you’ve been considering getting some AirPods for a while, whether for yourself or for a Christmas gift, now is the time to buy.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/headphones/120302/apple-airpods-2nd-generation">second generation of AirPods</a> shouldn’t be confused with the <a href="https://uk.pcmag.com/reviews/123347/apple-airpods-pro">AirPod Pro</a> model, costing £249. Instead, the model on sale is the redesigned set of AirPods that released early in 2019.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/bdx2?or=https%3A%2F%2Fuk.icms.pcmag.com%2Fadmin%2Farticle%2F123646%2F1%2F%3Finline">AirPods</a> have dropped down to <a href="https://r.zdbb.net/u/bdx2?or=https%3A%2F%2Fuk.icms.pcmag.com%2Fadmin%2Farticle%2F123646%2F1%2F%3Finline">£129</a>, saving you £30 on the list price of £159. Each purchase also includes a sleek and stylish white charging case.</p>
      <p>If you’re looking to get the wireless charging case instead, this will cost a little bit more at £169, but considering the price is normally just under £200, this isn’t a bad deal either.</p>
