      <p>TradeStation Group, the US subsidiary of Japanese financial services giant Monex Group, is going live with its cryptocurrency brokerage offering under the brand name <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/forex/products/tradingview-completes-api-integration-with-tradestation/">TradeStation Crypto</a>.</p>
      <p>For the new offshoot, TradeStation leverages its brokerage industry expertise to address what it perceives to be key concerns and certain weaknesses in the current cryptocurrency ecosystem. Monex has previously filed a money service business registration with each state regulator. A money transmittal license (MTL) allows the venue to offer both crypto-to-crypto and fiat-to-crypto trading pairs.</p>
