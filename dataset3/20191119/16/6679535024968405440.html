      <p>MADURAI</p>
      <p>In a major drive against encroachment, the Corporation engineers, accompanied by police, evicted a number of buildings raised close to the Vaigai riverbed on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>According to the officials, the encroachment was taken note of and the persons concerned were informed about the illegal space occupied. After giving them sufficient time to vacate on their own, the officials, with the aid of bull dozers, razed down them.</p>
      <p>Initially, there was some resistance as women came in large numbers opposing the move. However, they were informed about the encroached area and the large posse of police ensured smooth operation.</p>
      <p>The day-long drive began from Alwarpuram, the point where the Lord Kallazhagar would enter the Vaigai. A senior official said that a minimum of 100 metres from the outer wall of the riverbed should be free from any kind of encroachment.</p>
      <p>After clearing the debris, the road sported broad at many junctions, including Pulianthope, Ramarayar Mandapam, Jatka Thope, Sha Theatre, Pattaraikara Street, Sandaipettai, Munichalai among other stretches abutting the Vaigai.</p>
      <p>The drive would continue, he said and added that a few buildings, including the one belonging to a former MLA, were not removed as there were some legal issues.</p>
      <p>As part of the smart city initiative, a number of works have been taken up around Meenakshi Temple, Mariamman Teppakulam, Periyar bus stand and other areas, the officials said.</p>
      <p>Similarly, it had been proposed to reconstruct the public space along the Vaigai riverbed and lay roads from Alwarpuram to Sha Theatre side, which could be used as an alternative route to the cramped Panagal Road, they added.</p>
