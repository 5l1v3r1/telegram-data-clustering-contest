      <h1>Jerry Jones Reveals What Bill Belichick Told Him In The ’90s</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:57:36+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/chrisrosvoglou" target="_blank">Chris Rosvoglou</a></address>
      <p>This weekend, two of the most historic franchises in the NFL will square off: the Dallas Cowboys and the New England Patriots. With kickoff still a few days away, Jerry Jones shared a fascinating story about a conversation he had with Bill Belichick more than two decades ago.</p>
      <p>Prior to becoming the head coach of the Patriots, Belichick was fired by the Cleveland Browns. To this day, that goes down as one of the worst decisions in league history.</p>
      <p>Jones revealed today that he ran into Belichick – after he was fired by Cleveland – at a ski resort.</p>
      <p>Belichick told Jones to not forget about him if he had an opening with the Dallas Cowboys in the future.</p>
      <p>Dallas never went after Belichick as he ended up having successful stints with the New York Jets and New England Patriots.</p>
      <p>Nonetheless, Jones admit that he still thinks about that conversation from time to time.</p>

      <p>Instead of going after Belichick, the Cowboys decided to hire his mentor in Bill Parcells.</p>
      <p>As for the Patriots, the franchise has won six championships with Belichick at the helm.</p>
      <p>The Cowboys could be in the market for a head coach this offseason if they don’t re-sign Jason Garrett. However, it doesn’t sound like Belichick will be walking through that door anytime soon.</p>
