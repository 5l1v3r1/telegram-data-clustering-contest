      <p>With the shrouds of mystery over the two men that tried to cross over into Pakistan territory clearing, the Young Telugu techie Myadan Prasanth’s father here says his son might have strayed into Pakistan boundaries in a state of depression.</p>
      <p>Prasanth, along with Darilal of Madhya Pradesh, was detained by Pakistan police at Cholistan on charge of illegally trespassing into its territory.<br/> <br/>According to Prashant’s father Babu Rao, Prasanth went missing from 29 April, 2017, and never returned home. It was believed that he went in search of his former colleague, with whom he was in love while working in Bengaluru between 2010 and 2013.  <br/> <br/>His family hails from Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh but currently living in Hyderabad.</p>
      <p>His father Babu Rao, a private employee, said Prasanth was in a state of depression when he left home almost 30 months ago. “After the girl left for Switzerland he shifted to Hyderabad and a joined an IT company in Madhapur. One day he went to office and never returned,” Baburao told reporters.<br/> <br/>Baburao lodged a complaint with the Madhapur police on the same day. Police confirmed that a complaint of missing person was registered and search was conducted for some time before concluding that he was not traceable.</p>
      <p>“The police were told by Prashant’s kin that he was slightly unstable hence the case has been closed,” an officer closely monitored the missing case said.<br/> <br/>The family got a sigh of relief when it saw the video message from Prasanth from a Pakistan court on Monday. But, is worried that he is in trouble on the foreign land. “While I am happy to see my son, I am not really sure when and how he went into the hands of the Pakistan rangers,” Baburao said.</p>
      <p>Police here also say that Prashanth might have tried the land route to Europe and might have taken the help of the other person who might be an agent for illegal immigration.<br/> <br/>Babu Rao and his relatives are leaving for Delhi to meet the officials in the external affairs ministry to seek their help in getting Prasanth released the earliest possible.</p>
