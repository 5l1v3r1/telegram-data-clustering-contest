      <p>Marzia Kjellberg has long been a beloved part of the PewDiePie fandom, meeting her now-husband way back in 2011.</p>
      <p>Eight years on, the 27-year-old is thriving, having opened her own jewelry store, boasting a huge following on Instagram, and having married the love of her life.</p>
      <p>However, it hasn’t always been an easy journey for the Italian star.</p>
      <p>Marzia first met PewDiePie – real name Felix Kjellberg – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/22/pewdiepie-gushes-new-wife-marzia-bisognin-first-time-unearthed-video-10612986/">back in 2011, when her best friend introduced her to his channel.</a></p>
      <p>After chatting online, Felix flew out to Italy to meet his beau, a story his mum told at the pair’s wedding, with them quickly becoming an item.</p>

      <p>With PewDiePie staying with Marzia’s family for Christmas 2011, she made her first appearance on his channel on Christmas Day, and the pair promised to eventually make more videos together.</p>

      <p>If only they knew.</p>
      <p>Although the first part of their relationship was long-distance, Marzia jetted off to Sweden to live with her boyfriend not long after they started dating, spending a year out there.</p>
      <p>‘Because I decided to have a different type of life than I expected, I started comparing my life to other people’s,’ she explained of that time in her life.</p>
      <p>‘All my friends were either at university, or having stable jobs, and I had neither of those things. I was very unsure about what I was doing.’</p>
      <p>Creating her own YouTube channel a few months after Felix began his, Marzia discovered a passion for making lifestyle and beauty vlogs, coming out of her shell as a shy introvert.</p>

      <p>However, when PewDiePie’s channel began to blow up, Marzia confessed to feeling ‘overwhelmed’ by all the attention. Really, who wouldn’t?</p>
      <p>By December 2013, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/03/04/pewdiepies-unlikely-rise-to-the-top-from-minecraft-and-brofists-to-t-series-and-making-youtube-history-8803698/">Felix had the most-subscribed channel in the world</a>, a spot he held for a record-breaking six years.</p>
      <p>‘I was thrilled for Felix but I felt like I was a fraud,’ Marzia said afterwards. ‘I definitely didn’t deserve all the attention, I just happened to know someone who did.’</p>
      <p>In 2013, after living in both of their home countries, they met in the middle and settled down in Brighton – but things didn’t get much easier for Marzia.</p>
      <p>At this point, she had allowed her passion for YouTube to take over her life, cutting herself off from friendships.</p>
      <p>After realising how much she’d been isolating herself, the star managed to open herself up again, making new friendships, especially in the YouTube space.</p>

      <p>With all looking like it was going swimmingly for YouTube’s power couple, it’s no surprise that fans were taken aback in October 2018, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/04/27/youtube-star-pewdiepie-gets-engaged-marzia-bisognin-7503962/">months after the couple got engaged in Japan</a>,  when Marzia uploaded her video ‘Goodbye Youtube’.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>She unexpectedly revealed she was quitting the platform for good, taking down the vast majority of her content.</p>
      <p>‘All I have is this feeling that it’s time for me to try something new in my life,’ she explained.</p>
      <p>‘This might seem so sudden to most of you, probably, but it is something that I knew for a long time, especially this year. I struggled to find a reason to keep going.’</p>
      <p>However, it definitely wasn’t the last fans heard of Marzia, as she continued to thrive on social media.</p>

      <p>In fact, the star made a brief return to YouTube in PewDiePie’s video ‘QnA with future Wifey’, with fans going into a bit of a meltdown about the whole thing.</p>
      <p>The pair went on to hit headlines <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/20/youtuber-pewdiepie-marries-marzia-bisognin-eight-years-together-10601351/">when they tied the knot in an intimate ceremony in London’s Kew Gardens</a> back in August, exactly eight years after they started dating.</p>
      <p>Despite Marzia’s earlier uncertainty about how she fitted into Felix’s role in the spotlight, in his wedding speech <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/24/pewdiepie-breaks-tears-declares-love-marzia-bisognin-new-wedding-video-10626086/">he actually attributed much of his success to his wife</a>, telling attendees: ‘I am most of all happy and grateful to finally be Marzia’s husband.</p>
      <p>‘We met at a time where I was feeling very lost, but every day since I met Marzia has been the best days of my life.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘Marzia has taught me to always go for what you want, without any hesitation, and that has opened my life to so many new experiences that I never would have even dreamed to be possible.’</p>
      <p>We love a happy ending.</p>
