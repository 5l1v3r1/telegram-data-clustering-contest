        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a> plan to trigger a one-year extension in Eric Bailly’s contract, despite the defender not featuring all season due to injury.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 25-year-old joined the Red Devils in the summer or 2016 from Villarreal for a fee of £30m, but has made just 50 league appearances since then due to injuries and inconsistent form.</p>
      <p>The Ivorian’s last competitive appearance for Man Utd was on 28 April against <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/chelsea-fc/">Chelsea</a> in the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a>, when he suffered a medial ligament injury on his right knee.</p>
      <p>The centre-back returned to training and played in <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/pre-season-football-fixtures/">pre-season</a> but suffered another knee injury in a friendly against Tottenham which required surgery.</p>
      <p>‘He’s had an operation,’ said manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in July. ‘He’ll miss the best part of four or five months. Hopefully, we’ll get him back around about Christmas.</p>

      <p>‘It was positive news from the surgeon, he had the operation this morning. He was positive it was all repaired and that he’ll be fine.’</p>

      <p>Despite this turbulent time for Bailly, he is due to be awarded another year at the club, with the <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10377844/man-utd-trigger-eric-bailly-contract-renewal-clause-free-transfer/">Sun</a> reporting that an extension will be triggered by United.</p>
      <p>The Old Trafford hierarchy still rate the defender highly and do not want to see him leave on a free transfer when his current contract expires in the summer of 2020.</p>
      <p>A Manchester United source told the Sun: ‘The club have invested a lot of money and time into Eric over the past few years.</p>
      <p>‘He has is undoubtedly one of the best defenders here when he can stay fit and healthy.</p>
      <p>‘We don’t want players running down their deals. Eric might see his future differently at the end of the day.</p>
      <p>‘For the next year, at least, we will box him off and see how his playing time fares over the rest of this season.’</p>
      <p>Solskjaer’s latest update on Bailly came on 6 November when he said: ‘I think we can see them coming into training, especially Eric, in the next two to three weeks.</p>
      <p>‘Hopefully he can join the boys and he won’t take too long.’</p>
