      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:13:04+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/B-Chandrashekhar-775/" target="_blank">B. Chandrashekhar</a></address>
      <p>The link-two of Kaleshwaram project having pump houses at Nandi Medaram (Package-6) and Laxmipur (Package-8) have reached their full potential of lifting about 2 tmc ft of Godavari water every day from November 15 by pumping the required volume of water drawn from Yellampalli barrage to Mid Manair reservoir.</p>
      <p>According to the project officials, the two pump houses became fully operational when all the motors, seven each, became functional during the last week of October. However, all the pumps were not operated at once till November 15.</p>
      <p>With the decision to pump water to Mid Manair, the lifting of water in Nandi Medaram and Laxmipur pump houses began on November 8 again and the pumping reached full capacity on November 15. As a result, the water storage in Mid Manair reached 12.64 tmc ft on Tuesday (November 19) morning from just 2.2 tmc ft on November 8 morning, after it was emptied early last month to take up some repairs, to arrest some seepage of water noticed, to the earthen bund.</p>
      <p>The engineers at Laxmipur pump houses stated that although each motor pump with 139 MW capacity was expected to lift 3,150 cusecs of water, they were lifting a higher volume of 3,500 cusecs each.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the water storage in Yellampalli barrage came down to 9.76 tmc ft on Tuesday morning from 19.59 tmc ft on November 8 morning. The Kaleshwaram project engineers stated that the replenishment of water in Yellampalli would begin in a couple of days by lifting back of Godavari water from Medigadda, Annaram and Sundilla barrages in the link-one of the project.</p>
