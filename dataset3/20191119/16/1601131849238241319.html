      <p><a href="https://news.samsung.com/br/galaxy-match-ferramenta-da-samsung-ajuda-consumidor-a-escolher-smartphone-na-black-friday">Samsung Brazil</a> has launched a dedicated webpage for <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/tag/black-friday/">Black Friday</a> called <a href="https://samsung.com.br/blackfriday/#match">Galaxy Match</a>, designed to help prospective buyers determine which Galaxy smartphone model would best suit their needs.</p>
      <p>The online interactive tool lets you answer five questions about what you expect out of your Galaxy device, and then shows a recommendation based on your criteria.</p>
      <h3>Not sure which smartphone to buy on Black Friday? Galaxy Match might help</h3>
      <p>Are you a power user or a more casual one? Do you like smaller or larger screens, and how much battery do you need throughout the day? Once you answer these questions and determine a price range, Samsung Brazil’s Galaxy Match webpage will reveal a Galaxy device that should fulfill your needs, at least in theory.</p>
      <p>We don’t expect the interactive tool to be perfect and results might vary from one user to another, but it is a good place to start if you’re unsure about your next purchase. At the very least, it might give you a few interesting ideas, even if you don’t reside in Brazil where Galaxy Match seems to be available exclusively for the time being. It’s unclear whether Samsung will launch similar Galaxy Match webpages in other regions ahead of Black Friday, but good deals are bound to crop up either way.</p>
      <p>Do you plan on buying a new Galaxy smartphone on Black Friday, and if you’ve already used Galaxy Match, are you satisfied with the results? Or maybe you have already taken advantage of Samsung’s <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/early-black-friday-deals-samsung-us-uk/">earlier deals</a> and you won’t be buying any new devices at the end of the month. Either way, feel free to let us know in the comment section below.</p>
