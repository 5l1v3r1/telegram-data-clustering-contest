      <h1>FMSCI bans its chief from officiating championships</h1>
      <h2>Move comes in the wake of the death of three at the Rally of Jodhpur</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:34:38+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:34</time> by <a rel="author">PTI</a></address>
      <p>National Motorsports Federation FMSCI has banned its own president J. Prithiviraj from officiating in the wake of the organisational blunder that led to death of three, including a minor, during the ill-fated Rally of Jodhpur.</p>
      <p>While Prithiviraj will continue to be president of the FMSCI, he won’t be allowed to officiate in national championships for three years. Top rally driver Gaurav Gill had crashed into a trespassing motorcycle carrying three people, including a minor, during the rally in September, forcing the organisers to call off the rally.</p>
      <p>A shocked Gill was granted bail last month in connection with the case.</p>
      <p>The five-member FMSCI panel that included past presidents Vicky Chandhok and Akbar Ebrahim, recommended a three-year ban on Prithviraj, the event’s clerk of the course (COC).</p>
      <p>Prithviraj, who is part of the Coimbatore Auto Sports Club, was assisting rally organisers Maxperience.</p>
      <p>“The panel’s recommendation is to impose a ban on the COC of the event from officiating as a COC of any National Championship events for a period of 3 years and must officiate as DCOC for one year after 3 years,” read an official FMSCI note, which is in possession of <i>PTI</i>.</p>
      <p>The inquiry panel’s recommendations were passed unanimously by the 10-member council.</p>
      <p>Prithivraj expectedly recused himself from the meeting. The inquiry panel was headed by council member Farokh Commissariat.</p>
      <p>When asked, the FMSCI president said he has no knowledge of the ban imposed on him.</p>
      <p>“I have received no communication yet (on the ban),” Prithviraj said.</p>
      <p>The three-year suspension for the FMSCI president is nothing short of an embarrassment for the sport’s governing body.</p>
      <p>“It is a clear case of conflict of interest. How can you be the president and a race official at the same time?” a source asked.</p>
      <p>The FMSCI has also banned event organisers Maxperience and its representative Arvind Balan for three years till December 31, 2022.</p>
      <p>A ₹5 lakh penalty has also been imposed on Prithviraj’s Coimbatore Auto Sports Club which will also not be allowed to organise a National Championship outside the city till December 31, 2022.</p>
