      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/jack-grealish">Jack Grealish</a> is on course to return for Aston Villa in Monday's crunch Premier League home clash with <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle</a> when former boss Steve Bruce returns.</p>
      <p>Villa skipper Grealish has missed the club's last two top-flight games as Dean Smith's men have lost to <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> and <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolves</a> .</p>
      <p>He also missed the club's Carabao Cup win over a weakened Wolves side due to a calf injury sustained in the 3-0 loss at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> last month.</p>
      <p>It saw Grealish, 24, leave the Etihad Stadium on crutches but he is due back in training later this week after some time off in the international break.</p>

      <p>Grealish has been in fine form this term after inspiring his boyhood club to promotion last season.</p>
      <p>He has two goals and three assists and is the most fouled player in the top-flight ahead of Wilfried Zaha after also being singled out in the Championship last term.</p>
      <p>But the uncapped former England U21 ace continues to be overlooked by Three Lions boss Gareth Southgate who has selected Leicester's James Maddison instead.</p>

      <p>Villa have badly missed Grealish after slipping to 17th in the Premier League – four points below Newcastle who are bossed by Bruce.</p>
      <p>Bruce coached Villa from October 2016–October 2018 but was sacked after being hounded out by fans who even threw a cabbage at him.</p>
      <p>Former Villa manager Tim Sherwood reckons it is a mistake overlooking Grealish ahead of next summer's European Championships after comparing his ability to England legend Gazza.</p>
      <p>Sherwood, in charge at Villa Park from February 2015-October 2015, said: “You have two friendlies in March but I think it may be a bit late for Jack.</p>
      <p>“I think we've missed a trick because this kid is special - 100% they missed the boat on him.</p>
      <p>"Jack takes the ball to the opposition, he goes right at the heart of people, he dribbles like Paul Gascoigne.”</p>
