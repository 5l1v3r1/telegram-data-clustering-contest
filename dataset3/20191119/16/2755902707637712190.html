      <p>Crooner Trevor Dongo has spoken out on the controversial semi-nude picture of him with one of Jah Prayzah’s dancers known as Lissa Tanaka which has since gone viral on social media.</p>
      <p>The picture set tounges wagging on social media with some feeling that the display was over the top and almost obscene.</p>
      <p>Dongo scoffed at <a href="https://www.hmetro.co.zw/trevor-d-speaks-on-semi-nude-pic/">rumors that the two are in a relationship and stated it’s just pure art.</a></p>
      <aside>“It was just a picture appreciating art and there is a project we are working on together with Lissa.<br/>“We are trying to portray a love so clean and without boundaries, shared with one mind joining two souls into becoming one.”<br/>“There is nothing more to the picture and I think people should start embracing art in the new era,” said Dongo.</aside>
      <p>Lissa Tanaka declined to comment on the picture.</p>
      <aside>“I have no comment over the circulating picture,” she said.</aside>
