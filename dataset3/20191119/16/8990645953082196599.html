      <h1>Young Adults Prefer ‘Friendsgiving’ Over ‘Thanksgiving’</h1>

      <p>Go figure – millennials would rather hang out with their friends than their family during the holiday season. Sorry if I come off as snarky, it’s just that I believe most people would rather hang out with friends than family because, well, unlike family, you choose your friends.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/18/most-young-people-enjoy-friendsgiving-more-than-thanksgiving/">study</a> conducted by OnePoll, on behalf of Sabra polled 2,000 Americans between the ages of 18 and 38 and found that 68 percent prefer ‘Friendsgiving’ as their autumnal festivity.</p>
      <p>Here are the main reasons why:</p>
      <p>1. Friendsgiving is more social.</p>
      <p>2. They get to avoid personal questions from their family.</p>
      <p>3. They feel less pressure to impress their guests.</p>
      <p>4. They don't have to watch what they say at the dinner table.</p>
      <p>5. They don't have to worry about offending a relative.</p>
      <p>In other words, young people (and most people of all ages I know) would rather avoid conflict.</p>
