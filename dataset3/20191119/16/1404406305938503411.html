      <h1>White Woman Gets 10 Years in Prison for Mailing Bomb to Obama's Home</h1>

      <p>According to reports, 47-year-old Julia Poff was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison for her involvement in sending an explosive to the home of Barack Obama.</p>
      <p>Poff pleaded guilty to the charges in July, but not before telling a judge that she and her family helped many people in need over the years. From there, she reportedly began to read bible verses to the judge but was shut down. The judge said, “Talk to me, don’t be reading me Bible verses. I need to understand why you’re saying you’ve done good for so many people and how that squares with the fact that you made bombs and sent them ... with the intent to kill.”</p>
      <p>Prosecutors noted that Poff mailed a package addressed to Barack Obama that contained an explosive device. A White House handling facility intercepted the bomb, and the facility was evacuated as a result. The FBI confirmed the package was a bomb.</p>
