      <p><b>No More Breakfasts at Tiffany’s (</b><a href="https://pagesix.com/2019/11/18/tiffanys-shuttering-iconic-blue-box-cafe-during-renovations/"><b>Page Six</b></a><b>)<br/></b>Renovations at Tiffany &amp; Co.’s Fifth Avenue flagship mean the famed Blue Box Cafe on the shop’s fourth floor will close after the holidays. Tiffany will relocate to 6 E. 57th street during construction, with the cafe set to reopen in 2021.</p>
      <p><b>Jennifer Lopez Is the New Face of Coach</b><br/>Starting with the Spring 2020 season, Jennifer Lopez will be shot by Juergen Teller for Coach campaigns around the world. “I’m so excited for this collaboration,” she said. “It is a timeless brand that I’ve always been a fan of and the upcoming collection really speaks to my personal style — an uptown downtown mix.”</p>
      <p>“Jennifer is so authentic,” added Stuart Vevers, creative director of Coach. “She’s determined and she’s an original who has followed her own path to do things her own way — she really embodies the attitude of Coach.”</p>

      <p><b>Gender-Bias Lawsuit Against Sterling Jewelers to Go Forward (<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-signet-sterling-arbitration/large-gender-bias-class-action-vs-sterling-jewelers-revived-u-s-appeals-court-idUSKBN1XS28I">Reuters</a>)</b><br/>The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan has “restored” a nationwide class action arbitration suit against Sterling Jewelers (which includes the brands Kay, Jared, and Zales) by its former employees. This now allows “at least 70,000” former and current female employees to pursue claims that the retailer “paid them less and promoted them less often than men for a decade.” Initially in January 2018, a lower-court judge ruled that “an arbitrator lacked power to include women in the class who had not said they wanted to join it, rather than only the 254 who authorized it.”</p>
