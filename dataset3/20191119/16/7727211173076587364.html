      <h1>Two new restaurants including seafood diner could soon open in Sefton</h1>
      <h2>If approved, the borough would get two additions to its already wide choice of eating out options</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:00:49+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/kate-lally/" target="_blank">Kate Lally</a></address>
      <p>Two new restaurants could soon open in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/sefton">Sefton</a> , expanding the already-varied options for eating out in the borough.</p>
      <p>Plans to turn a former shop in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/birkdale">Birkdale</a> into an restaurant have been submitted to <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/sefton-council">Sefton Council</a> by a Mr Mike McComb.</p>
      <p>If approved, the proposal will see the former June The Florist store on Liverpool Road transformed into a restaurant.</p>
      <p>Documents on the local authority's website say the new development would be open 9am-1am, seven days a week.</p>

      <p>The premises is flanked by Costa Coffee to the left and Birkers bar to the right, with a number of restaurants in the vicinity also.</p>
      <p>The florist ceased trading in May 2018.</p>
      <p>And a seafood restaurant could soon open in <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/crosby">Crosby</a> .</p>
      <p>The Mussel Kitchen Limited has requested permission for a premises licence to operate from 62 Liverpool Road.</p>

      <p>Owners are seeking approval to open from Tuesday and Wednesday, 4-10pm, and Thursday to Sunday, 12-10pm.</p>
      <p>The Mussel Kitchen also wants to serve alcohol and play recorded music during the same times.</p>
      <p>The site was formerly 'Merseyside Boiler Services' and a mobility scooter shop - and is only a stone's throw away from similar projects which have been denied permission to open.</p>
      <p>At the beginning of this year, Mustard &amp; Co on College Road had its plans to serve food and drink until 6pm Monday-Wednesday and 10pm Thursday to Sunday <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/cafe-divided-merseyside-community-15811832">rejected by Sefton Council</a> - despite the authority being set to approve proposals.</p>

      <p>And in July, Gambino's was <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/controversial-community-bar-denied-permission-16530353">refused planning permissio</a> n for its proposed Coronation Road venture.</p>
      <p>Applicant Sophie Weymouth said she had plans to make the bar-restaurant a social space - hosting craft and crochet lessons, screen classic films and book club.</p>
      <p>But people living nearby complained there are enough similar venues in the area already.</p>
      <p>The plans were refused after Cllr Michael O'Brien said Gambinos would have a 'negative effect on local amenities'.</p>
      <p>The two new proposed restaurants will be decided upon by Sefton's planning and licensing committees, respectively, in due course.</p>
