      <p>"She's just six and absolutely lovely," said Jessie.</p>
      <p>Jessie added of her blossoming relationship: "Chan and I got photographed before our relationship was even a thing and that created such pressure.</p>
      <p>"We've needed to get to know each other. We've just had our first holiday together, which was wonderful, but that's all I'm saying..."</p>
      <p>They first found a spark in the months following the breakdown of Channing's marriage to ex-wife and mother of Everly, Jenna Dewan.</p>
      <p>The pair announced their split in April last year, with Jenna admitting she "felt blindsided" when she found out Channing was romancing the singer.</p>
