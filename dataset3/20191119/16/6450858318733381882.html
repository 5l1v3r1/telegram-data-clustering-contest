      <h2>Here's how to pick up the latest Dyson tech for less, with savings expected across the company's line of vacuums, fans, air purifiers, hairdryers, and more</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:51:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:51</time> by <a rel="author">Dominic Preston</a></address>
      <p>Dyson has made a name for itself in just about every market its entered. Whether it's vacuums, fans, air purifiers, or even hairdryers, there's a good argument to be made that Dyson makes the best version of that product around.</p>
      <p>Still, that quality comes at a price. A very literal price, as Dyson tech also tends to be amongst the most expensive around too, as you're paying a premium not only for the performance, but also for Dyson's design and brand name. That's why Dyson products are among the most sought after when it comes to big sales like <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/feature/internet/black-friday-2018-3661756/">Black Friday</a> and <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/feature/gadget/best-cyber-monday-deals-3667890/">Cyber Monday</a>.</p>
      <p>We're tracking all the best Dyson tech deals right here all year long, so stay tuned.</p>

      <h3>Best Dyson discounts: What to look for</h3>
      <p>Realistically, just about Dyson product you can find discounted is worth considering, especially if there's a decent reduction. Still, here are the main products to look out for.</p>
      <h4>Vacuums</h4>
      <p>In terms of <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/test-centre/digital-home/best-vacuum-cleaner-2018-3680117/">vacuums</a>, the cordless stuff is undoubtedly the most exciting. The V11 is the company's latest cordless vacuum, so if you can find that for cheap snap it up - we gave it a <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/cleaning/dyson-v11-absolute-3695005/">rave review</a>.</p>
      <p>However you can still pick up the older V10, V8 and V7 models - and even a refurbished V6 - which are still great, and are more likely to see serious reductions in the sales. You'll get slightly short battery life and weaker suction, but performance is still very strong, especially if you have a smaller house or flat to clean.</p>
      <p>One quick word of explanation too: you'll see different versions of each model with names like 'Animal' or 'Absolute' - these basically just refer to which accessories are included in the box, so don't pay too much attention unless there are specific cleaning tools you know you need.</p>
      <p>If you don't care about cordless, now could be a great time to pick up one of Dyson's corded vacuums too. The company has stopped developing new corded models, so we're expecting retailers to try to clear stock of the existing line, which could mean some hefty savings.</p>
      <p>Finally, Dyson also has one <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/test-centre/digital-home/best-robot-vacuum-cleaners-3679094/">robot vacuum</a>, the 360 Eye. It's a few years old, and we're expecting a successor soon, which means there should hopefully be some decent discounts this year.</p>
      <h4>Fans and purifiers</h4>
      <p>Dyson keeps expanding its <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/test-centre/digital-home/best-fans-2018-3680333/">range of fans</a>, so there are a lot to look out for. Expect the lowest prices on the regular <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/digital-home/dyson-cool-desk-review-3679671/">Dyson Cool fans</a>, which are the regular bladeless fans (and still pretty exciting for that).</p>
      <p>If you want something that you'll actually use in the winter too then look out for the Hot + Cool range - as the name suggests, these can both heat and cool, making them more useful year-round.</p>
      <p>Then there's the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/digital-home/dyson-pure-cool-tower-review-3679590/">Pure Cool range</a>. These are both fans and air purifiers, ideal if you're worried about air quality in your home. There is a Pure Hot + Cool if you want the works, but this is actually an older model and will lack some of the refinements added in the current Pure Cool range. All of them will connect to the Dyson app though.</p>
      <p>Finally, Dyson makes a humidifier too. This is usually less appealing in the UK, where damp tends to be a bigger issue than dryness, and unfortunately that niche means it's unlikely to see any serious savings here.</p>
      <h4>Hair stylers</h4>
      <p>The other big consumer area Dyson has moved into is a slightly odd one: <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/buying-advice/digital-home/best-hair-dryer-3683824/">hair stylers</a>. Starting with the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/digital-home/dyson-supersonic-hair-dryer-3649512/">Supersonic hair dryer</a>, and now followed up with the Airwrap styler, it turns Dyson is pretty good at hair care.</p>
      <p>The Supersonic is now a few years old, which means you should expect to see good savings over the next few months. Unfortunately the Airwrap is so new that we'd be surprised if prices went down by much. Keep an eye out for £10 or £20 off, but we wouldn't expect much more than that.</p>
      <h3>Where to find Dyson offers</h3>
      <p>First up, the obvious place to check is <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=803X112721&amp;xcust=06-3685974-11-0000000&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.techadvisor.co.uk%2Fbuying-advice%2Fdigital-home%2Fdyson-deals-3685974%2F&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dyson.co.uk%2Fen.html">Dyson's own online store</a>. The company doesn't do discounts often, but it does do its best to price match other retailers, so it's often a good starting point at least.</p>
      <p>Still, you should definitely look elsewhere as well, not least because other retailers often slash prices on older Dyson models that the official store doesn't stock any more.</p>
      <p>As with most things, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/l/1648331031?ascsubtag=06-3685974-11-0000000">Amazon</a> is one of the best places to look first, especially if you look in the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/deals/ref=nav_cs_gb?ascsubtag=06-3685974-11-0000000">Deals of the Day</a>. These discounts offered for a limited time (often for a few hours only), or until stocks run out - they're also known as Lightning Deals.</p>
      <p>We'd recommend <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/prime/pipeline/landing?ascsubtag=06-3685974-11-0000000">signing up to Amazon's 30 day free trial of Prime</a>, which will not only get you access to <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/deals?ascsubtag=06-3685974-11-0000000">Lightning deals</a> 30 minutes earlier than non-Prime members, but will also get you free next-day delivery. Plus, you'll get access to Prime Video, which you can access through your smart TV, and other benefits during your trial, too.</p>
      <p>If you're in the UK, other great places to look include <a href="http://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/7928211/type/dlg/sid/06-3685974-11-0000000/https://www.argos.co.uk/static/ArgosPromo3/includeName/Dyson-shop-home.htm">Argos</a>, <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1599&amp;awinaffid=254429&amp;clickref=06-3685974-11-0000000&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fgbuk%2Fsearch-keywords%2Fxx_xx_xx_xx_xx%2Fdyson%2F1_20%2Frelevance-desc%2Fxx-criteria.html">Currys</a>, <a href="https://prf.hn/click/camref:1011l37wF/pubref:06-3685974-11-0000000/destination:https%3A%2F%2Fao.com%2Fdyson">AO</a>, and <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=3090&amp;awinaffid=254429&amp;clickref=06-3685974-11-0000000&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.very.co.uk%2Fdyson%2Fe%2Fb%2F4294958017.end">Very</a>. It's always worth keeping <a href="http://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=1203&amp;awinaffid=254429&amp;clickref=06-3685974-11-0000000&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.johnlewis.com%2Fbrand%2Fdyson%2F_%2FN-1z140en">John Lewis</a> in mind too - the company's price match policies mean it often matches some of the best deals from other retailers, while including better customer service and warranty policies.</p>
