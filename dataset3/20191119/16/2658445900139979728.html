      <p><b>W</b>hy do some people court law enforcement agencies to resolve civil matters?</p>
      <p>Experts have blamed  the occurence on the poor attitude of some lawyers and limited capacity of the courts.</p>
      <p>They spoke at this year’s annual business luncheon, organised by the law firm of SPA Ajibade &amp; Co, in Lagos.</p>
      <p>The theme of the event was: <i>The courts vs law enforcement agencies, which one is better for the resolution of civil disputes?</i></p>
      <p>The participants listed the limited capacity of courts to enforce their decisions as one of the reasons.</p>
      <p>They also blamed lawyers for abandoning the courts and running to law enforcement agencies, especially the police, to resolve disputes for their clients through frivolous petitions.</p>
      <p>“In some cases, the lawyers are in the habit of seeking the services of the law enforcement agents, especially the police and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), for ordinary debt recoveries, instead of using  the law courts, for such civil obligations.</p>
      <p>“And because legal practitioners in Nigeria encourage the law enforcement agencies to take over the duties of the courts, the agencies overstep their bounds by arbitrarily somersaulting the rule of law and applying the rule of force.</p>
      <p>“When a complaint is made to them, instead of employing due process in unraveling the truth in the matter through investigation, arrest, detention and prosecution, they often times, apply brute force by beginning with arrest and detention before returning to investigate the complaint and by  so doing, they abuse the rights of citizens in the process.”</p>
      <p>Participants noted that law enforcement is under the executive arm of government, which now chooses which decisions of the courts to enforce, thereby emasculating the judiciary.</p>
      <p>The conferees noted that if this trend is allowed to fester, it portends a dangerous signal for the survival of democracy and the sustenance of the rule of law.</p>
      <p>They urged institutions like the National Judicial Council (NJC) and the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) to take severe disciplinary measures against judges who compromise their coveted positions and unscrupulous lawyers with the habit of subverting the course of justice by applying delay tactics to cases.</p>

      <p>They also recommended disciplinary action against lawyers who write frivolous petitions to law enforcement agencies and other institutions for monetary gains.</p>
      <p>The annual business luncheon was attended  by Justice Helen Ogunwumiju ( JCA), who represented the chaiman of the event, Justice Amina Augie (JSC). The lead speaker was a former Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice in Lagos State, Mr. Olasupo Shasore (SAN).</p>
      <p>Other speakers were Justice Biobele A. Georgewill ( JCA),  the Special Adviser to Oyo State Governor on security matters, Mr. Fatai Owoseni and the current Chairman  NBA Lagos  branch, Mr. Lateef Omoyemi Akangbe.</p>
      <p>Former NBA President Mr. Austin Alegeh (SAN), Mrs. Funke Adekoya (SAN), a judge of the National Industrial Court of Nigeria, Port-Harcourt Division, who also doubles as a visiting judge to Lagos Division, Justice Nelson Ogbuanya, Chief Sena Anthony, among others.</p>
