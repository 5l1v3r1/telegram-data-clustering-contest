      <h2>The likes of Calvin Klein, Converse, Estee Lauder are just a handful of the names which could be reduced this year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:18:55+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:18</time> by <a rel="author">Stacey Dutton, Chantelle Symester</a></address>
      <p>Next are yet to disappoint us with their Black Friday sales.</p>
      <p>The high street favourite is always a hit this time of year with items perfect for gifts for the whole family.</p>
      <p>The store hasn't always taken part in the annual sales - but since it has in the last two years the store has included hundreds of items of clothing, accessories, home and furniture products from between 50 and 70 per cent off in stores and online.</p>
      <p>The discounts across all departments will attract those looking for gifts, those looking to spoil themselves for their Christmas party outfit or simply to get stocked up for the festive period.</p>
      <p>The sale in previous years has featured  <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1531042&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.next.co.uk%2Fclearance%2Fsearch%3Fw%3D*%26af%3Dproductaffiliation%3Ablackfriday&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.birminghammail.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fuk-news%2Fshoppers-able-save-designer-brands-17281810">savings of up to 70% off</a> , with discounts even spreading into their <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1531042&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.next.co.uk%2Fclearance%2Fsearch%3Fw%3D*%26af%3Dgender%3Aolderboys%2520gender%3Aoldergirls%2520gender%3Ayoungerboys%2520gender%3Ayoungergirls%2520productaffiliation%3Ablackfriday&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.birminghammail.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fuk-news%2Fshoppers-able-save-designer-brands-17281810">kidswear</a> and <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1531042&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.next.co.uk%2Fclearance%2Fsearch%3Fw%3D*%26af%3Dgender%3Ahomeware%2520productaffiliation%3Ablackfriday&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.birminghammail.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fuk-news%2Fshoppers-able-save-designer-brands-17281810">home</a> sections.</p>
      <p>Shoppers will also be able to save 50% off selected branded items as the sale continues throughout the weekend- with the retailer now stocking plenty of huge names including Armani, Calvin Klein and high street favourites <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinaffid=213635&amp;awinmid=5672&amp;clickref=Wales-blackfridayNewLook&amp;platform=dl&amp;p=%5B%5Bhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.next.co.uk%252Fshop%252Fbrand-newlook-0%5D%5D">New Look</a> , Monsoon and River Island.</p>
      <p>But if you are brave enough to head into store our advice is to pick a quieter high street, such as a retail park branch - you'll have a better chance at finding items you actually want.</p>

      <h3>Next Black Friday sale - what you need to know</h3>
      <p>The retailer is no stranger to huge seasonal sales, but in 2017 it finally succumbed to industry pressure and took part in Black Friday and hasn't looked back since.</p>
      <p>For 2018 many items were reduced by over 50 per cent, with some adult clothing items down to under £10.</p>
      <p>The deals we spotted were some of the best running during  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/black-friday-2019-start-date-20395035">Black Friday</a> , and if Next sales of the past are anything to go by 2019's offering will fly off the shelves in record time too.</p>
