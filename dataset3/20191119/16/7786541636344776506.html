      <p><b>WHITEHALL, Pa.Â (AP)</b> - A Pennsylvania man who shot a police officer who responded to a call at his home has been sentenced to probation.</p>
      <p>William Sturtevant, of Whitehall Township, was sentenced Monday to 10 years of probation in the shooting of Officer Jason Mertz.</p>
      <p>Police say Sturtevant armed himself with two loaded guns as he waited for burglars who he believed had broken into his home. After Sturtevant called 911, he heard someone downstairs who he thought was the burglar.</p>
      <p>He went into the basement and fired a shotgun, hitting Mertz.</p>
      <p>Sturtevant had pleaded guilty to aggravated assault of a law enforcement officer.</p>
      <p>Mertz asked the judge to allow a plea deal so he would be able to pursue a civil claim against Sturtevant.</p>
      <p>Mertz says he may never be able to return to active duty.</p>
