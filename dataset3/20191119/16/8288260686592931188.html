      <h1>West Brom have been handed triple boost ahead of Sheffield Wednesday clash</h1>
      <h2>Albion will be without Nathan Ferguson, Romaine Sawyers and Jake Livermore against the Owls on Saturday - but three other senior stars are getting important minutes under their belts</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:10:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:10</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Chapman, https://www.facebook.com/josephchapmanBM/</a></address>
      <p>Gareth Barry, Kieran Gibbs and Chris Brunt all got valuable minutes under their respective belts on Tuesday afternoon as West Brom's reserve side hammered their Port Vale counterparts 4-0 at the club's training ground in the Central League Cup.</p>
      <p>As domestic football returns, and with Slaven Bilic’s first team hosting Sheffield Wednesday at The Hawthorns this Saturday, the trio of heavily experienced players were handed run-outs in the reserve tournament, in which Albion top their group.</p>
      <p>Supporters have seen precious little of Gibbs and Brunt in the first team this season, but both are to be handed minutes alongside the returning Barry, who needs competitive minutes in his legs after a lengthy period of rehabilitation following surgery earlier this year.</p>

      <p>Gibbs broke his toe in training last month, but hasn’t actually played a part at all since the 1-1 draw at Derby in August. He played 78 minutes against the Valiants.</p>
      <p>He returns into contention to find Conor Townsend doing his best to make the left-back spot his own, in the absence of Nathan Ferguson.</p>
      <p>For Brunt, too, his 45 minute run-out will be very useful; Bilic will be without Jake Livermore and Romaine Sawyers against the Owls and there are positions in midfield that must be filled.</p>

      <p>Barry, meanwhile, got an hour into his legs as the Baggies proved far too strong for Vale.</p>
      <p>Albion, who also boasted Jonathan Bond in goal, took the lead thanks to Rayhaan Tulloch.</p>
      <p>Striker Jamie Soule found the net twice before Chris Willock - still hoping to force his way into Bilic's thinking - rounded off the scoring at the death.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Saul Shotton and Rekeem Harper also featured for the Baggies and got 90 minutes of action apiece.</p>
      <p><b>Albion:</b> Bond; White, Martinez, Shotton, Gibbs (Harmon 78); Barry (Clayton-Phillips 62), Brunt (Wilding 45); Tulloch, Harper, Willock; Soule.</p>
      <p><b>Port Vale: </b>Maddison, Atkinson, Brisley, Kennedy, Campbell-Gordon, Evans, Trickett-Smith, Browne, Conlon, Lloyd, Pope.</p>
