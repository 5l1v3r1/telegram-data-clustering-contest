      <h1>Council defends record on tackling illegal dog breeding and puppy farming</h1>
      <h2>Carmarthenshire has a large dog breeding industry - and council chiefs would like the public to report any concerns</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:25:44+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:25</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Youle</a></address>
      <p>New dog breeding standards and tougher licensing conditions are being drafted in Carmarthenshire to help regulate the growing industry.</p>
      <p>The council is also promoting an approved breeder scheme and wants the public's help in reporting unlicensed commercial breeding.</p>
      <p>A report before the council's environmental and public protection scrutiny committee said organised crime was involved in the sector nationwide.</p>
      <p>Councillors were told at a meeting that dogs from Eastern Europe and Ireland were transported to <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/carmarthenshire">Carmarthenshire</a> for sale.</p>
      <p>Cllr Philip Hughes, executive board member for public protection, said it was an emotive issue which had been flagged up in a recent BBC Wales documentary.</p>
      <p>"I think it's fair to say that as an authority we didn't come out particularly well in that programme," he said.</p>
      <p>But he said he believed Carmarthenshire was the most proactive authority in dealing with ever-increasing dog licensing issues.</p>
      <p>He added: "We are in the process of developing new standards of trading and strengthening licensing conditions, and these will be presented in the next few weeks."</p>
      <p>Carmarthenshire has 85 licensed dog breeders, around 10 of whom have more than 100 dogs.</p>
      <p>A further 43 illegal breeders have been identified of late, mainly by monitoring social media and internet selling platforms like eBay.</p>
      <p>Successful prosecutions have yielded Â£275,000 for the authority in the last two years alone through the Proceeds of Crime Act.</p>

      <p>The council has a regulatory responsibility to license breeders who breed three or more litters in a 12-month period. It also licenses pet shops and dealers, and investigates commercial breeding and pet shop welfare concerns.</p>
      <p>Officers give breeders advice - and have refused 23 licences in 2019-20 to date, compared to nine refusals in 2018-19.</p>
      <p>The committee was told that the legal process was slow, with court warrants required to enter someone's property who wasn't a licensed trader.</p>
      <p>An officer said: "We have to be very sure before we go into a private property.</p>
      <p>"We do understand there are private dwellings which are being used as breeding establishments, and we are taking active steps.</p>
      <p>"But the legal system is not a quick process."</p>
      <p>The officer also said council officials were meeting the Welsh Government shortly to discuss the issues.</p>
      <p>Welsh ministers are currently drafting a law which would ban third parties like pet shops or commercial dealers from selling puppies and kittens, unless they bred the animals themselves.</p>
      <p>Carmarthenshire Council wants to focus its resources on illegal dog breeding, monitoring the activity online, and raising standards.</p>
      <p>The scrutiny report said 18 breeders were eligible for its approved breeder scheme, which would give reassurances to buyers and a reputational boost for sellers.</p>
      <p>Cllr Joseph Davies said if every buyer demanded to see a puppy with its mother, illegal breeding would be eradicated.</p>
      <p>Cllr Hughes said: "We are trying to encourage breeders to join this 'buy with confidence' scheme.</p>
      <p>"To get on it is quite a rigid process. You have to have certain checks done."</p>
      <p>He also said it was frustrating when people who knew of illegal breeding didn't come forward to the authorities.</p>
      <p>Cllr Mansel Charles called for an investigative inquiry to be set up on illegal dog breeding, but it was decided that a committee task and finish group would be established instead.</p>
      <p>Committee chairman, Cllr John James, said the public had a role to play, and added that many dog breeders were compliant with the regulations.</p>
      <p>Cllr Hughes said after the meeting that he didn't feel the documentary programme had portrayed the authority in a good light, given the work it was doing.</p>
