      <p><i>Cats </i>the musical is hard to spoil because at the absolute core of the show, barely anything happens. Buncha cats show up, they introduce themselves, and at the end one of them gets the delightful privilege of dying. With that in mind you have to hand it to the new trailer for the film adaptation of <i>Cats</i>, which lays out this premise fairly early and spends the rest of its time letting its digital fur technology run wild. </p>
      <p>"Milk!" bellows one cat, after Idris Elba turns up looking like a sex pest in furry clothing. "Yeah!" moans Jason Derulo in what appears to be a neon nightclub sequence filled with felines. This is fine. Everything's normal and fine.</p>
      <p><i>Cats</i> arrives in theaters Dec. 20. </p>
