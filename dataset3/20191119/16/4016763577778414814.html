      <p>On Monday, <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Cardi-b">Cardi B</a> shared a <a href="https://genius.com/Cardi-b-11-18-19-freestyle-lyrics">new freestyle</a> on Instagram to give fans “a little something until I finish the album.” Over the <i>Magnum P.I.</i> theme song, Cardi takes aim at her haters and boasts about her come-up.</p>

      <p>Cardi opens up about losing some friends during her rise to fame:</p>
      <blockquote>These bum bitches is broke, and I don’t respect that<br/>Lot of sugar daddy talk, but they don’t reflect that<br/>You ain’t open up no business, got no Benzes<br/>I be in a mansion and you be in my mentions<br/>I came right out the trenches to top of the charts<br/>Lost friends on the way, this shit is breakin' my heart</blockquote>
      <p>She continues by referencing her role in the movie <i>Hustlers</i>:</p>
      <blockquote>I don’t act, I’m a hustler, just playin' my part<br/>What you spend on your whip, bitch, I spend on my fit</blockquote>
      <p>As <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Camron">Cam'ron</a> fans would point out, Cardi isn’t the first MC to rap over the <i>Magnum P.I.</i> theme. Back in 1998, the Dipset leader dropped a track titled <a href="https://genius.com/Camron-357-lyrics">“357”</a> that samples the detective show’s theme song, which is created by Mike Post.</p>
      <p>Cardi’s freestyle is meant to tide over fans until her sophomore album, tentatively titled <a href="https://genius.com/albums/Cardi-b/Tiger-woods"><i>Tiger Woods</i></a>. Earlier this year, the Bronx rapper said it would be <a href="https://genius.com/a/cardi-b-says-her-next-album-tiger-woods-is-dropping-in-2020">arriving in 2020</a>.</p>
      <p>In a recent <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8543622/cardi-b-interview-new-album"><i>Billboard</i></a> interview, Cardi spoke about not chasing trends on the project.</p>
      <p>“There’s certain music that I want to do, but I feel like, ‘Is people interested in that?’” she explained. “I feel like it’s more like a twerk sound going on right now. It’s just like, ‘Should I just do my music around that?’ But I cannot just go with what’s hot. I still gotta go with what I want to do.”</p>
