      <h1>What time and channel is Munster v Racing 92? TV information, kick-off time, odds and more for the Heineken Cup game</h1>
      <h2>Simon Zebo returns to Thomond Park</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:53:27+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/donagh-corby/" target="_blank">Donagh Corby</a></address>
      <p>It's going to be a special evening in Limerick for former Ireland star Simon Zebo when he returns with Racing 92.</p>
      <p>The Cork native and his partner Elvira Fernandez welcomed their third child, baby Noah Anthony, earlier this week, and this will be Zebo's first game since his birth.</p>
      <p>In terms of action on the pitch, it's the hosts that go into the game as favourites after Munster's comfortable defeat of Ospreys.</p>
      <p>Racing beat Saracens in an impressive 30-10 win last weekend, and they look a force to be reckoned with this season.</p>
      <p>Here's all you need to know about the game:</p>
      <h3>When is it on?  </h3>
      <p>The match is set for kick off at 5.35 pm on Saturday, 23rd November.    </p>
