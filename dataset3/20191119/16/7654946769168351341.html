      <h1>Week 12 fantasy waiver wire pickups: Jonathan Williams, Bo Scarbrough</h1>

      <p>It’s the home stretch of the fantasy football regular season and the last of the bye weeks are upon us. The Arizona Cardinals, Kansas City Chiefs, Los Angeles Chargers and Minnesota Vikings are off this week, so make sure you have a backup plan if you have Kyler Murray, Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce, Keenan Allen, Melvin Gordon, Hunter Henry or Dalvin Cook on your roster.</p>
      <p>Below are a handful of waiver wire candidates owned in fewer than 50% of Yahoo fantasy football leagues who you should consider picking up:</p>
      <h3>Quarterbacks:</h3>
      <p>— <b>Ryan Tannehill, Tennessee Titans (21% owned)</b>: Tannehill has been a good streaming option since Week 7 when he took over for Marcus Mariota. In Week 10, he completed 13 of 19 passes for 181 yards and two touchdowns against the Chiefs. He will be well-rested going into Sunday against the Jaguars, who have lost two straight games with a defense that has had an up-and-down year.</p>
      <p>— <b>Jeff Driskel, Detroit Lions (3%)</b>: Driskel put up big numbers for the second straight game in Sunday’s 35-27 loss to the Cowboys. He completed 15 of 26 passes for 209 yards and two touchdowns, and added 51 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown. He gets a very favorable matchup this week against the Redskins, who gave up four touchdowns to a struggling Sam Darnold in Week 11. You could do worse than Driskel as a Week 12 streamer.</p>
      <h3>Running backs:</h3>
      <p>— <b>Derrius Guice, Washington Redskins (48% owned)</b>: In his return to action on Sunday, Guice had seven rushes for 24 yards and caught a 45-yard touchdown, capping out a solid fantasy performance. It’s difficult to predict how the workload will shake out with Adrian Peterson competing for snaps, but as long as he’s healthy, the young running back will play a role in this offense. He faces a Lions defense in Week 12 that was just torched for 35 points in Week 11, and is worth an add during waivers if he’s not already owned in your league.</p>
      <p>— <b>Jonathan Williams, Indianapolis Colts (4%)</b>: <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/18/fantasy-football-injury-report-for-week-11-mitch-trubisky-marlon-mack/">Marlon Mack suffered a fractured hand</a> during Sunday’s win over the Jaguars and will be out indefinitely. Williams had a huge game and racked up 116 yards on 13 rushes and caught one pass for 31 yards. He should be the No. 1 ahead of Nyheim Hines (17% owned), who could also be worth a look in deeper leagues, with both Mack and Jordan Wilkins (ankle) sidelined. The Colts face the Texans on Thursday night. Houston’s stout rushing defense, which had not allowed a 100-yard rusher in 25 regular-season games, gave up 263 yards on the ground against the Ravens in Week 11, including 112 to Gus Edwards.</p>
      <p>— <b>Trey Edmunds, Pittsburgh Steelers (3%)</b>: <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/browns-steelers-fantasy-football-takeaways-juju-smith-schuster-james-conner/">James Conner re-aggravated a shoulder injury</a> early in Thursday night’s game and his prognosis is unclear moving forward. Edmunds will be the No. 2 option behind Jaylen Samuels and is worth a look, especially with the winless Bengals on deck in Week 12.</p>
      <p>— <b>Bo Scarbrough, Detroit Lions (2%)</b>: Scarbrough came out with a bang in his NFL debut and had 14 rushing attempts for 55 yards and a touchdown. He shouldered 49% of the workload out of the backfield which is surprising given he was only promoted from the practice squad on Saturday. The former Alabama star appears to be the favored back over Ty Johnson and J.D. McKissic in Detroit. The Lions have a great Week 12 matchup in Washington, making Scarbrough a RB3 going into Sunday’s game.</p>
      <h3>Wide receivers:</h3>
      <p>— <b>Darius Slayton, New York Giants (25% owned)</b>: Slayton is a must-add with wide receiver <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/18/sterling-shepard-takes-big-step-with-giants-return-uncertain/">Sterling Shepard still in the concussion protocol</a> and tight end <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/06/evan-engrams-newest-injury-couldve-been-a-lot-worse/">Evan Engram (foot)</a> possibly missing another game. <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/18/darius-slayton-is-turning-into-dave-gettlemans-special-draft-steal/?utm_medium=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=NYPSportsTwitter&amp;utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;sr_share=twitter">The rookie has been impressive</a>, and picked up a pair of touchdowns in Week 10 against the Jets on 10 catches and 121 yards.</p>
      <p>— <b>Chris Conley, Jacksonville Jaguars (13%)</b>: While D.J. Chark is still the No. 1 target in Jacksonville, Conley has at least seven targets in each of the last four games and has more fantasy points than Dede Westbrook on a per-game basis. He has deeper-league flex value in an offense that is frequently trailing and forced to be pass-heavy.</p>
      <p>— <b>James Washington, Pittsburgh Steelers (8%)</b>: Pittsburgh receivers JuJu Smith-Schuster and Diontae Johnson <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/browns-steelers-fantasy-football-takeaways-juju-smith-schuster-james-conner/">both suffered head injuries</a> during <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/myles-garrett-uses-helmet-to-clock-mason-rudolphs-head-in-fight/">Thursday night’s wild game</a> and there is a good chance that one or both miss time. Washington caught three of five passes for 49 yards last week, though his performance was more of a reflection on Mason Rudolph, who tossed four picks before the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/myles-garrett-uses-helmet-to-clock-mason-rudolphs-head-in-fight/">infamous brawl with Myles Garrett</a>. He will be the next man up and will try to take advantage of a soft matchup against the Bengals next week.</p>
      <p>— <b>Kendrick Bourne, San Francisco 49ers (1%)</b>: <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/18/fantasy-football-injury-report-for-week-11-mitch-trubisky-marlon-mack/">Emmanuel Sanders aggravated a rib injury</a> in Week 11 which forced him from the game. The 49ers leaned on Deebo Samuel (54% owned), who reeled in eight of 10 targets for 134 yards, but it was Bourne who collected the touchdown. His targets have increased in the past two weeks with Sanders banged up. He could be worth an add in deeper leagues, especially if Sanders sits out.</p>
      <h3>Tight ends:</h3>
      <p>— <b>Jacob Hollister, Seattle Seahawks (31% owned)</b>: Hollister took over for Will Dissly after Dissly tore his ACL in Week 6 and has looked fantastic in the two weeks prior to the Seahawks’ Week 11 bye. In those two games, he caught 12 of 16 passes for 99 yards and three touchdowns and he appears to be a serious red-zone threat in an explosive offense.</p>
      <p>— <b>Ryan Griffin, New York Jets (4%)</b>: Griffin had a huge game in the <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/17/sam-darnolds-career-day-leads-jets-in-easy-win-over-redskins/">Jets’ 34-17 win over the Redskins</a>, catching all five of his targets for 109 yards and a touchdown. He is emerging as a usable streamer now that <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/12/jets-chris-herndon-brian-winters-to-miss-rest-of-season/">Chris Herndon is out for the year</a> and has had four good weeks for fantasy out of the last six games played. The Jets’ next three matchups are against Oakland, Cincinnati and Miami, whose defenses rank 24th, 27th and 32nd in the league, respectively, in average points allowed.</p>
      <h3>Defenses:</h3>
      <p>— <b>Cleveland Browns D/ST (49% owned)</b>: The Browns defense came up big time in Week 11 with four sacks, four picks and only seven points allowed against Rudolph and the Steelers. At least some of that had to do with <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/browns-steelers-fantasy-football-takeaways-juju-smith-schuster-james-conner/">three of Pittsburgh’s main weapons going down</a> with some kind of injury, but they face the Dolphins in Week 12, <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/myles-garrett-suspended-indefinitely-for-browns-steelers-fight/">and even without Myles Garrett</a> they have a good chance to make it two straight solid fantasy performances.</p>
      <p>— <b>Detroit Lions D/ST (7%)</b>: The Lions should bounce back after a disappointing, albeit expected, performance against the Cowboys. Washington is one of the softest matchups each week for fantasy with <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/18/dwayne-haskins-begs-for-help-from-redskins-hapless-offensive-line/">a beleaguered Dwayne Haskins at the helm</a>. Detroit is a great Week 12 streaming option.</p>
