      <p>You may well have heard the phrase banded around by politicians before, and if you read any of the election manifestos you will likely see a version of it again.</p>
      <p>Talk of "2% of GDP", "the NATO target of 2%, "the NATO spending commitment", and other variations could all be mentioned before the 2019 General Election on Thursday 12 December.</p>

      <h3>But what is '2%' defence spending?</h3>
      <p>It can sound like political and economic gobbledygook, but it is a relatively simple concept.</p>
      <p>It s a commitment that the UK will spend 2% of its national income (also known as <a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/knowledgebank/what-is-gdp">'Gross Domestic Product' or GDP</a>) on defence.</p>
      <p>In other words, £2 out of every £100 spent in the UK will be spent on defence.</p>
      <p>That means if the economy is growing defence spending will go up at least at the same rate; and if the economy is doing really well, growing faster than prices are rising, defence notionally has more spending power.</p>
      <p>But if there is a recession, when the economy gets smaller, defence spending might also fall with it.</p>

      <h3>Why 2%?</h3>
      <p>After the Cold War, European defence spending was falling, so in 2002 NATO members agreed a non-binding goal that they would each spend at least 2% of national income on defence.</p>
      <p>The idea was to stop spending going any lower than it already was.</p>
      <p>It didn’t really work - the UK was one of very few to remain at or above 2%.</p>
      <p>At the 2014 Wales NATO summit, allies renewed their pledge to spend 2% on defence, by stopping cuts and increasing spending so that it would be back to 2% of national income by 2024.</p>
      <p>When the renewed pledge was made some were predicting UK defence spending would fall below 2% of GDP that year, though in the end, it didn’t.</p>
      <p>NATO has 29 member countries. According to NATO estimates, the UK is <a href="https://www.forces.net/news/world/nato-which-countries-pay-their-share-defence">one of seven alliance members</a> to meet or exceed the 2% spending target.</p>

      <h3>Is 2% an election issue?</h3>
      <p>It’s been a sort-of issue in the last two elections, but not one that has been a significant point of difference for the biggest parties.</p>
      <p>At the 2015 General Election none of the main parties, apart from UKIP, would commit to keeping defence spending at or above the 2% goal.</p>
      <p>However having won that election, David Cameron’s government then committed to meeting the target for at least the next five years.</p>
      <p>When the 2017 election was called, the Conservatives, Labour, the Liberal Democrats, and UKIP all committed to keep meeting the 2% pledge in their manifestos.</p>
      <p>Since then there have been some calling for the UK to aim higher than 2%, but in an election dominated by Brexit and the NHS the parties are unlikely to make any big shifts on defence.</p>
