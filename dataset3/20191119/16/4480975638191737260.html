      <h3>USD/INR: Bears hit 38.2% Fibo./200-hour SMA confluence</h3>
      <p>After an initial uptick to levels beyond the 72.00 handle, the USD/INR pair came under some renewed selling pressure and has now eroded a major part of the previous session's gains.</p>
      <p>The downtick, also marking the third day of a negative move in the previous four, dragged the pair back closer to a support line marked by 38.2% Fibonacci level of the 70.53-72.37 move up. <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/news/usd-inr-technical-analysis-bears-challenge-382-fibo-200-hour-sma-confluence-support-201911191255">Read more…</a></p>

      <h4>Dollar trading below 72.00 against Indian rupee</h4>
      <p>Markets are challenging 71.60 support and the 50 SMA. If the market bounces from here, the spot can revisit the 72.00 handle and possibly the 72.25 <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance">resistance</a> if the bulls gather enough steam.</p>
      <p>On the flip side, a break below 71.60 can see the market decline and trade towards the 71.20 level. <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/news/usd-inr-technical-analysis-greenback-trading-below-7200-handle-against-the-indian-rupee-201911191517">Read more…</a></p>
