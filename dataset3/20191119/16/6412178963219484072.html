        <b>Manchester United are reported to be closing on a swoop for highly-rated Sweden midfielder Dejan Kulusevski with their hopes given a further lift following a big admission from his parent club Atalanta.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 19-year-old, who is owned by Atalanta, has hit two goals and five assists in 13 games so far this season during his loan stint with Parma and that had Wolves and Southampton scouts checking on his progress.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/exciting-parma-starlet-catches-man-utd-scouts-eye-whilst-watching-smalling"><b>United were reported to have earmarked him as a potential recruit last week</b></a> after a scout delivered a glowing reference on the player and it’s claimed they have again had <b>Kulusevski</b> watched over the latest round of international fixtures.</p>
      <p>And while <i>The Sun</i> also credits Arsenal with an interest in the player, reports in the Italian media suggest it is United leading the way and talk of a transfer to Old Trafford, most likely in summer 2020, is beginning to gather pace.</p>
      <p>And it seems Atalanta director of sports Giovanni Sartori is resigned to losing the player come the end of the season after he admitted they’d find it difficult to turn down a big-money bid for his services.</p>
      <p>“Dejan is a great player. I hope that you can see him with Atalanta, it would also be an achievement for our youth system,” he told Bergamo based newspaper <i>L’Eco</i>. “But if he continues the way the season began, I imagine it will be something difficult to see.”</p>
      <p>Kulusevski, who has largely operated on the right for Parma this season, joined Atalanta from Swedish club Brommapojkarna in 2016 and is rated at around €40m by the Serie A side.</p>

          <b>In other Manchester United news, it looks like being a big January window for the club with a double £185m deal said to be looking increasingly likely.</b>
