      <h1>The Rise of Skywalker Won’t Leave Loose Threads for a New Trilogy</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:51:59+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:51</time> by <a rel="author">Tudor Leonte</a></address>
      <p>In a little more than a month, <b><a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker">The Rise of Skywalker</a> </b>will walk into theaters and wrap things up for the Skywalker family in the <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/star-wars"><b>Star Wars </b></a>universe. Director J.J. Abrams bears a heavy burden on his shoulders, yet he feels less of the pressure now than when he shot <a href="http://superherohype.com/tag/star-wars-the-force-awakens"><b>The Force Awakens</b></a>. Speaking with <i><a href="https://ew.com/movies/2019/11/19/star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker/">Entertainment Weekly</a>,</i> Abrams added that people have to expect something way bigger than what they saw before.</p>
      <p>“We had more story adjustments on <b>VII</b> than this one,” Abrams said. “We didn’t know if these characters would work, if the actors would be able to carry a <b>Star Wars</b> movie. There were a lot of things we didn’t know. On this, we knew who and what worked, and everyone is doing the best work I’ve ever seen anyone do. But the ambition of this movie is far greater than <b>Force Awakens</b>. What we set out to do was far more challenging. Everything is exponentially larger on this.”</p>
      <p>You can also hear the director’s and the cast’s words about <b>The Rise of Skywalker </b>in the player below.</p>

      <p>Abrams promised also that <b>The Rise of Skywalker </b>won’t leave loose ends, and it won’t set up a future story. The director’s statement has been corroborated by several actors from the movie, such as the man behind C-3PO, Anthony Daniels.</p>
      <p>“It’s a very good ending, and a good ending feels right,” Daniels stated.</p>
      <p>It is also possible that some already solved questions from the past movies will find a more satisfying answer. Like the question of Rey’s parentage.</p>
      <p>“The parents thing is not satisfied — for her and for the audience,” Daisy Ridley said. “That’s something she’s still trying to figure out — where does she come from?”</p>
      <p>And what about that Rey-Kylo relationship? Well, actor Adam Driver has an answer for that too:</p>
      <p>“I don’t think it’s all one thing,” he added. “Part of the fun of playing it is the boundaries of it keep changing. At times it’s more intimate, sometimes less intimate. Sometimes it’s codependent. And then it’s, obviously, adversarial.”</p>
      <p><b>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</b> will hit theaters on December 20. Would you like to see more adventures of the Skywalker family? Or do you agree that it is time to wrap things up? Let us know in the comments section below.</p>
