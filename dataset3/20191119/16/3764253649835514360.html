        <b>Kylian Mbappe's mother Fayza Lamari has reportedly told Paris-Saint-Germain's chiefs that her son will not be extending his contract at the club when the current deal expires.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The latest development will come as a tonic for Real Madrid who have been looking for the signature of the France international.</p>
      <p>According to the report on UK Sun, Fayza Lamari has told Real Madrid chiefs that £342m world record fee is still on on Kylian Mbappe.</p>
      <p>Mbappe's current contract runs out in the summer of 2022, and PSG would love to get the French star tied down to a new long-term deal.</p>

      <p>But Kylian's mother does not want her son to remain in Paris and Real Madrid can now start process to sign him next summer.</p>
      <p>Paris-Saint-Germain could be making big money in the summer should they agree to sell Mbappe because Neymar is also being wanted by Barcelona.</p>

      <p>Although, Real Madrid are also reported to be interested in signing Neymar, but the Brazil international wants a return to the Nou Camp.</p>
      <p>He wants to have a reunion with Argentine star Lionel Messi at Barcelona who also wants Neymar back.</p>
      <p>Earlier, <b>Legit.ng</b> had reported how Kylian Mbappe <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1272299-kylian-mbappe-frenchman-shows-amazing-speed-strength-dijon-psg-game.html">was tipped as future football poster-boy</a> who has the classical touches and ingenuity to become Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo's heir.</p>
      <p>The Frenchman has always been proving himself beyond being a wonder-kid since announcing his presence into the global stage with a consistent stellar form that made him switch side to Paris-Saint-German in a big money transfer worth £180 million.</p>
