      <p>Airbnb Inc said on Tuesday it is lobbying local governments in Japan to ease curbs on short-term home rentals during next year's Tokyo Olympics, seeking to counter a thicket of rules imposed last year.</p>
      <p>TOKYO: Airbnb Inc said on Tuesday it is lobbying local governments in Japan to ease curbs on short-term home rentals during next year's Tokyo Olympics, seeking to counter a thicket of rules imposed last year.</p>
      <p>Japan's short-term home rental market plunged after Japan introduced a law requiring hosts to register with local governments and imposing other restrictions that prompted many to drop the service.</p>

      <p>Airbnb Japan country manager Yasuyuki Tanabe said the San Francisco-based company would seek tie-ups with local governments, asking them to craft exemptions to the rental curbs during next year's Games.</p>
      <p>The company expects to reach agreements with partnerships with some local government in the Kanto area around Tokyo, but Tanabe did not name any.</p>
      <p>Airbnb on Monday announced a nine-year partnership with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to provide accommodation for the world's biggest sporting event and cut the cost for host cities.</p>
      <p>The partnership runs from the Tokyo 2020 Games next year until 2028 and covers five Olympics and Paralympics events.</p>
      <p>The deal is worth US$500 million, the Financial Times reported, citing people briefed on the matter. Tanabe declined to provide any forward-looking numbers at a Tokyo news conference.</p>
      <p>The Japanese government exempts short-term rental hosts from the national law when demand for accommodation is expected to jump because big events. Local governments are authorized to run the service.</p>
      <p>Airbnb used those exemptions during this year's Rugby World Cup in the city of Kamaishi and four other places, which saw guest arrivals spike by 135per cent from a year earlier, the company said.</p>
      <p>"There aren't many events as exciting as the Olympics," Tanabe said. "We have many ways to participate in this event, but one way is to become a host for short-term stay."</p>
      <p>Japan's temporary lodging law limits home sharing to 180 days a year, a cap that hosts say makes it difficult to turn a profit. It leaves final decision-making up to local governments, many of which have imposed even stricter rules, citing security concerns.</p>
      <p>Airbnb's listings plummeted just before the law went into effect. Airbnb would not say how far its numbers had fell from the pre-law high of 62,000, but a week before the law kicked local governments approved just 150 listings.</p>
      <p>Airbnb said its listings have rebounded to 90,000.</p>
