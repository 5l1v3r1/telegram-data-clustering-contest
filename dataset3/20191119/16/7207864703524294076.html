      <h2>They're worried about Politico correspondent Tim Alberta.</h2>

      <p>The Democratic National Committee and journalists at PBS worry Politico’s choice to moderate December’s Democratic debate will be too conservative for the likes of the party, NBC reported Monday.</p>
      <p>Politico publisher Robert Allbritton wants Politico Magazine political correspondent Tim Alberta as the co-host for the sixth Democratic primary debate on Dec. 19 in California. The DNC and reporters at PBS are worried about Alberta’s ideological purity, NBC <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/all/politico-dnc-odds-over-democratic-debate-moderator-n1085201">reported</a>, citing sources.</p>
      <p>Alberta once wrote for National Review, a conservative magazine.</p>
      <p>PBS journalists Judy Woodruff, Yamiche Alcindor and Amna Nawaz are being considered for the job. DNC officials believe Alberta is out of step to co-moderate a debate meant to introduce the Democratic candidates to the American public, NBC reported.</p>
      <p>To make the sixth debate stage, Democratic candidates will need to hit more <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2019/10/25/democrats-dnc-qualifications-december-president-contest-debate/">stringent</a> requirements than was asked of them in previous debates. They must hit 4% in at least four DNC-approved early voting state polls or receive 6% support in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina or Nevada.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2019/10/25/rachel-maddow-moderate-democratic-debate/">fifth</a> debate is scheduled for Nov. 20 in the Atlanta, Georgia. Candidates <a href="https://dailycaller.com/2019/08/19/democrats-climate-change-cnn/">must</a> hit 3% in four national or early state polls and have 165,000 donors to qualify. Neither PBS, Politico, nor the DNF have responded to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.</p>
