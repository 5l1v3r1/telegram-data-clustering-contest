      <h1>Travis Scott Doesn’t Classify His Music As Strictly Hip-Hop</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:54:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:54</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Mench</a></address>
      <p>Although <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Travis-scott">Travis Scott</a> is typically viewed as a rapper, he thinks of his own music in a more genre-less manner. In an <a href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a29663455/travis-scott-j-balvin-interview-dior-2019/">interview with <i>Harpers Bazaar</i></a>, the Texas MC said he views his art through a wider lens than rap music.</p>
      <p>“I would just describe it as different pieces of my brain—a mix of genres that I listen to on the daily,” he said. The magazine also reported that he “chafes” at calling his music hip-hop, although they didn’t provide an exact quote about that.</p>
      <p>However, Scott has distanced himself from rap music classification throughout his career. “I’m not hip-hop,” he told <a href="http://www.mtv.com/news/1709582/travis-scott-hip-hop/">MTV in 2013</a> while promoting his <a href="https://genius.com/albums/Travis-scott/Owl-pharaoh"><i>Owl Pharaoh</i></a> mixtape. “All of that trap bullshit, it’s cool, but it’s not shit that can last forever… I might be an MC and a rapper, but man, I [do] this process differently.”</p>
      <p>Scott’s experimental style has brought him together with acts from <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Ozzy-osbourne">Ozzy Osbourne</a> to <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Stevie-wonder">Stevie Wonder</a> to <a href="https://genius.com/artists/James-blake">James Blake</a>, and his heavy use of Auto-Tuned vocal distortion has helped push the genre in a new direction. However, he still competes in the rap categories at awards shows and classifies his music as such on digital retailers and streaming services</p>
      <p>He’s not the first artist to view themselves outside the bounds of hip-hop. <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Post-malone">Post Malone</a> has caught backlash throughout his career for attempting to distance himself from rap music, first after <a href="https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2016/06/xxl-responds-to-post-malone/">not appearing on the XXL Freshman list</a> and later when he said <a href="https://genius.com/a/post-malone-thinks-new-hip-hop-is-lacking-real-sh-t">new hip-hop is “lacking real shit.”</a></p>
      <p>On the flip side, <a href="https://genius.com/a/lizzo-questions-why-shes-not-viewed-as-a-rapper-like-future-swae-lee">Lizzo recently complained</a> that she’s not viewed as a rapper even though male peers like <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Swae-lee">Swae Lee</a> and <a href="https://genius.com/artists/Future">Future</a> (who also sing on their records) are classified as hip-hop.</p>
