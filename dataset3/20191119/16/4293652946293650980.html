      <p>The 23-year-old forward has three goals and two assists in 20 games this season.</p>
      <p>Wills also reported that defencemen <a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/players/travis-hamonic/521878">Travis Hamonic</a> and <a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/players/t-j-brodie/508872">T.J. Brodie</a> won’t suit up for the Flames when they face the Colorado Avalanche on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Hamonic is dealing with a lower-body injury, while Brodie is still undergoing testing after collapsing during practice last week.</p>
