      <p>As the world observes Antibiotic Resistance Awareness Week, a university professor said antibiotic resistance could claim 10 million lives a year by 2050.</p>
      <p>According to University of Pretoria’s Professor Robin Green, Africa already has a high burden of infectious diseases, including a large portion of bacterial origin; in South Africa, high levels of antibiotic resistance already exist, mostly due to inappropriate antibiotic management and consumption.</p>
      <p>Green, who is the chairman of the school of medicine and director of paediatric services at the University of Pretoria, said antibiotics regimens were being misused.<br/>“Antibiotics do solve a number of bacterial infections, but we blur the boundaries between the fact that not all users require an antibiotic.”</p>
      <p>He said antibiotics should never be used to treat colds.</p>
      <p>“We should really not be using antibiotics for obvious viral infections such as a cold or flu.”</p>
      <p>Several programmes are now in place to drive down antibiotic use for obvious viral infections.</p>
