      <h1>Parliament proceedings: Opposition wants Speaker to act on Farooq Abdullah issue</h1>
      <h2>‘Ensure Srinagar MP’s presence’</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:13:33+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:13</time> by <a rel="author">Special Correspondent</a></address>
      <p>The Opposition parties are going to approach Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla seeking his intervention on behalf of the House to ensure that Srinagar MP Farooq Abdullah is allowed to attend the ongoing Parliament session.</p>
      <p>The Opposition parties are arguing that the onus lies on the Speaker to ensure the presence of Mr. Abdullah in the House since he has not sought a leave of absence and has been detained without any genuine grounds for his detention. Mr. Abdullah was re-elected from the Srinagar constituency in May 2019.</p>
      <p>The government has detained Mr. Abdullah under the Public Safety Act (PSA). The Opposition parties had taken up the issue during the all-party meeting on Sunday, and then once again in the Lok Sabha on Monday. The government has so far not come up with a concrete reply except for Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi saying that the government would look into it and do whatever possible within the framework of the law.</p>
      <p>“We seek to take all legitimate steps within the framework of Constitution to ensure Mr. Farooq Abdullah’s presence in the House,” National Conference MP Hasnain Masoodi said.</p>
