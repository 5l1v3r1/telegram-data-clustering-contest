      <p>Joe Worrall has picked his Nottingham Forest team of the decade - and it features two of his current teammates.</p>
      <p>With less than two months remaining of 2019, we at <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottinghamshire Live</a> have been asking Reds fans to select their fantasy <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Forest</a> XI of the last 10 years.</p>
      <p>Centre-back <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/joe-worrall">Worrall</a> - who joined the club aged 14 - has had his say, although he has not selected himself in the team.</p>
      <p>Instead, he has gone with a central defensive partnership of Jack Hobbs - who made 86 appearances for Forest between 2013 and 2018 - and current captain Michael Dawson, into his second spell at the club.</p>

      <p>The other member of <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/sabri-lamouchi">Sabri Lamouchi's</a> squad who makes the fantasy XI is goalkeeper Brice Samba.</p>
      <p>Worrall's full Forest team of the decade has a back four of Eric Lichaj, Hobbs, Dawson and Chris Cohen across the back four, with David Vaughan in defensive midfield and Ben Osborn and Henri Lansbury as the other central midfielders.</p>
      <p>Michail Antonio is on the right wing, Andy Reid takes the left-wing spot and Britt Assombalonga - the scorer of 30 Championship goals in 65 appearances - leads the line up front.</p>
      <p>Worrall's tweet also sheds light on a trio of players that came close to making his team.</p>
      <p>"[Wes] Morgan/Hobbs tight. Raddy (Radoslaw Majewski) and [Lewis] McGugan would love to squeeze either in as watching them growing up was awesome, but HL and BO class to play with."</p>
