      <h2>Retired veteran says pink ball during twilight period will be a challenge for on-field officials</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:51:29+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:51</time> by <a rel="author">PTI</a></address>
      <p>Sighting the pink ball during the twilight period will be a challenge not only for the batsmen but also the umpires, who are expected to attend some practice sessions to get used to the new colour, retired Australian umpire Simon Taufel said on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Taufel, who was present at the first-ever pink-ball Test in Adelaide as ICC Umpire Performance and Training Manager, said the umpires can use artificial lenses to have a better view.</p>
      <p>“I don’t know whether they will wear any special lenses to see the ball differently. That’s entirely up to them. But they will be attending as many net sessions as possible,” Taufel told PTI.</p>
      <p>“They will be going through their net session and simulation activities. Maybe trying to see some practice session with the pink ball so that they are pretty confident of seeing the right things at the right time,” he said.</p>
      <p>“You have a twilight period when the light changes as it goes from very bright to sunshine to artificial light. That period is more challenging for the batsmen to pick up the ball. I would expect a similar type of challenge for the umpires as well. It will be as hard and challenging for the umpires as well.”</p>
      <p>The Australian is in India for the promotion of his book <i>Finding The Gaps</i> as he’s expected to attend the historic Test.</p>
