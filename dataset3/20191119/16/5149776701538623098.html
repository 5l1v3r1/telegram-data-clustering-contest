      <h1>Decorated police officer Novlett Robyn Williams guilty of possessing indecent video but cleared of corruption</h1>
      <h2>Prosecutors said there was 'no way' Williams could have missed the clip</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:39:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:39</time> by <a rel="author">Ryan Hooper, PA Chief Reporter</a></address>
      <p>A highly decorated police officer has been found guilty of possessing an indecent video of a child, but cleared of corruption.</p>
      <p>Novlett Robyn Williams, who began her career at <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottinghamshire-police">Nottinghamshire Police</a> , where she was the first black woman to reach the rank of Sergeant, showed no emotion as she was convicted of the charge by a majority of 10 to one.</p>
      <p>Williams, 54, from south London, denied ever seeing the video, which was sent to her via WhatsApp by her sister, co-defendant Jennifer Hodge, in February 2018.</p>
      <p>But prosecutors said there was no way that Williams could have missed the 54-second clip, and cited a response from the officer to her older sister to "please call" as evidence that she wanted to discuss the content.</p>
      <p>Williams, who was commended for her work in the aftermath of the Grenfell Tower disaster, denied possessing an indecent image of a child and corrupt or improper exercise of police powers and privilege.</p>

      <p>Social worker Hodge, 56, of Brent in north-west London, was found guilty of distributing an indecent image of a child.</p>
      <p>Hodge's long-term boyfriend, bus driver Dido Massivi, was convicted of two counts of distributing an indecent photograph of a child, and one count of possessing an extreme pornographic image portraying a person having sex with a horse.</p>
      <p>Adjourning sentencing until November 26, Judge Richard Marks QC granted the defendants continued bail.</p>
      <p>He added: "Obviously I have not even begun to consider what the appropriate sentence might be."</p>
      <p>Williams made no reaction as the verdict was given but appeared upset as she left court.</p>
