      <p>Xiaomi has been working on improving fast charging for quite some time now. The company has been in a direct fight with Vivo <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/vivos-flashcharge-120w-technology-can-make-a-4000mah-battery-go-0-to-100-percent-within-13-minutes/">who has been rumoured</a> to be working on 120W fast charging technology. While we haven’t seen anything official from Vivo, Xiaomi has <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/xiaomis-redmi-to-soon-take-the-crown-of-fastest-fast-charging-smartphone-from-oppo/">already showcased</a> their 100W fast charging technology earlier this year.</p>
      <p>Now, the company has shared more information around the technology at Xioami Developers Conference. The Super Charge Turbo Technology as Xiaomi calls it will come with a high-voltage charge pump, 9-fold charge protection, and an independent MCU to reduce Deadlock. According to Xiaomi’s previous video, the new technology should allow phones with 4000mAh battery to fully charge in just 17 minutes.</p>
      <p>Xiaomi didn’t share any ETA on when the technology will be available but we expect it to make an appearance next year.</p>
