      <p>Not all builds are worth a look, but there are projects, such as this custom Factory Five 818, that certainly are. The 818 is a cool little kit car that would warrant a look on its own (it's a unique model, not a replica of something else), but this particular one is especially noteworthy.</p>
      <p>Instead of the Subaru powertrain the car is supposed to come with, this one has been fitted with the powertrain of a Tesla Model S P85D (it previously ran <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/tesla-powered-kit-car-becomes-a-9-second-129-mph-drag-racer-120484.html">just the rear motor</a>), so it has around 700 horsepower, yet it weighs around 1,100 kg (2,400 pounds). The Tesla with this powertrain hits 100 km/h from standstill in 3.3 seconds, so you can imagine how much faster this lightweight sports car is with the same output.</p>
      <p>It has been tested and it can consistently run the quarter mile in the low 9s (its record is 8.95 seconds), and its benchmark sprint time is surely under the 3-second mark. Its top speed was also measured at 220 km/h (137 mph).</p>
      <p>Power to the two motors is not provided from a Tesla battery pack, as that would have been way too big for this car‚Äôs small frame. Its creator opted to have it draw juice from a pair of <a href="https://www.autoevolution.com/news/2019-chevrolet-volt-gets-more-expensive-lt-trim-level-starts-at-33520-128121.html">Chevrolet Volt</a> battery packs with a total of 32 kWh - they apparently bestow this car with a real world range of around 200 km (120 miles).</p>
      <p>Another cool peculiarity of this project is that because it runs a custom controller for the electric motors, the driver can actually switch power to each axle on or off. In other words, the car can be run in front-wheel drive, rear-wheel drive or all-wheel drive, all at the tap of a screen - this apparently helps with warming each set of tires up individually before an acceleration run, but we‚Äôre sure more fun uses can be found for this feature. üèÅ</p>
