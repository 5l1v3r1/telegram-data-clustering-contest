      <p>The shutdown called by Manipur People Against Citizenship Amendment Bill (MANPAC) — an umbrella body of civil society organisations — paralysed life in the state on Tuesday, despite the government’s bid to counter the agitation.</p>
      <p>The Manipur government had on Monday ordered all government offices and educational institutes to remain open during the shutdown period.</p>
      <p>While employees did make it to work, classes could not be conducted in government school and colleges as students stayed away. Private educational institutions remained closed.</p>
      <p>Protesters came out on the streets, enforcing a road blockade and staging sit-in demonstrations in different parts of Imphal Valley.</p>
      <p>All business establishments in Imphal kept shutters down even as public transportation was suspended. To prevent untoward incidents, heavy security was deployed, particularly in Imphal.</p>
      <p>The shutdown, which came into effect on Monday midnight, concluded peacefully this evening at 6 pm.</p>
      <p>Some government employees complained that while the government had said it would penalise absentees, no arrangements were made to help them reach work.</p>
      <p>“While the government issued strict instructions to employees to report to duty, no security measures were provided to them. We had to face a lot of inconvenience in trying to cross roadblocks put up by protestors,” said an Imphal secretariat staffer.</p>
      <p>In September, the government had deducted salaries of as many as 223 employees for not coming to work during a bandh called by a militant group in the state.</p>
