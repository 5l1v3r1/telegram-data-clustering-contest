      <h1>5 independent directors’ posts fall vacant at CIL</h1>
      <h2>PSU takes up issue with Coal Ministry</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:55:34+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:55</time> by <a rel="author">Special Correspondent</a></address>
      <p>The posts of five independent directors at Coal India Ltd. have fallen vacant together, following the expiry of their tenure, the PSU said in a regulatory filing on Tuesday. CIL said the matter had been taken up with the Union Coal Ministry.</p>
      <p>The five directors are Loretta M. Vyas, S.B. Agnihotri, D.C. Panigrahi, Khanindra Pathak and Vinod Jain. They were among CIL’s seven independent directors.</p>
      <p>While Ms. Vyas and Mr. Agnihotri had served in the Indian Administrative Service, Mr. Pathak is a well-known mining expert and Mr. Jain is a chartered accountant.</p>
      <p>Their term (re-appointment for a year) expired on November 16, 2019.</p>
      <p>They were appointed in November 2015 for a period of three years.</p>
      <p>CIL has four functional directors in charge of marketing, technical, personnel and finance, besides the chairman and managing director. The vacancies come at a time when CIL, which produces over 80% of India’s coal, is struggling to increase its output. October was its third straight month of production decline. Between April and October 2019, CIL produced 280.4 million tonnes, 8.5% lower than a year ago.</p>
