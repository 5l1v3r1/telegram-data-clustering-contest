      <p>Kiwi indie rock band Racing are getting us in the mood for summer with their new video for latest single ‘Run Wild’.</p>
      <p>Quintessentially Kiwi, the video, shot around beautiful Matakana, was created in collaboration with arguably the ultimate summer drop - Long White Vodka.</p>
      <p>The video, directed by Chris Searl, epitomises the magic of summer in Aotearoa, with a narrative focusing on four friends enjoying a classic weekend away.</p>
      <p>Talking about how the music video came about lead singer Ed Knowles says; “We had just finished playing a gig at Leigh Sawmill when a nice ad-man came over and bought us a round of <i>Long Whites</i>.</p>
      <p>“He watched the show and suggested collaborating together, we thought the idea was fresh and different so we went with it!’</p>
      <p>With ‘Run Wild’ already playing on the radio, and the band nominated for Best Rock Artist at the Vodafone Music Awards, the band are eager for summer to get going with multiple gigs booked across the country.</p>
