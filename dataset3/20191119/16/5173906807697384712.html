        <b>The municipality of Estremoz has announced that it has approved an application for Community funds, covering four municipalities, to control water losses in Central Alentejo.</b>
      </p>
      <p>With a total eligible cost of €1 million, the project to "protect the environment and promote resource efficiency", to be funded by the Cohesion Fund, includes, in addition to Estremoz, the municipalities of Alandroal, Reguengos de Monsaraz and Viana do Alentejo, in the district of Évora.</p>
      <p>According to the promoters, the project aims to train the four municipalities, the managing entities, in the "effective management of water for supply and its uses".</p>
      <p>The initiative will also allow "to increase the level of monitoring of the flow rates to the four municipalities' water distribution networks", in order to create knowledge of the network to be managed, allowing "the effective control of the real losses through the early detection of ruptures in the conduct".</p>
      <p>The work also includes the correction of sections of water pipes where high losses associated with breakdowns are identified by replacing these sections.</p>
