      <h2>Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman admitted he made up elements of President Donald Trump’s call with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky in an official summary.</h2>

      <p>Prior to the call, Vindman included a discussion about corruption in the talking points provided to the president but Trump did not use them in the call.</p>
      <p>The summary Vindman wrote after the call read:</p>
      <blockquote>President Trump underscored the unwavering support of the United States for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity – within its internationally recognized borders – and expressed his commitment to work together with President-elect Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian people to implement reforms that strengthen democracy, increase prosperity, and root out corruption.</blockquote>

      <p>But Vindman clarified during his testimony that the president did not bring up the topic rooting out corruption during the phone call, but he included it in his summary of the call anyway.</p>
      <p>When asked by the Democrat counsel about whether the summary he wrote was false, Vindman hesitated.</p>
      <p>“That’s not entirely accurate, but I’m not sure I would describe it as false, it was consistent with U.S. policy,” Vindman said.</p>
      <p>Vindman said he included the rhetoric about corruption as a “messaging platform” to describe U.S. policy toward Ukraine, even though it was not discussed on the call.</p>
