      <p>In the latest episode of Liverpool TV's <i>GOAT List</i>, Brazil stars Fabinho and Roberto Firmino were asked to name the five greatest players to have represented their nation.</p>
      <p>The pair were given a list of 10 players to choose from, which included footballers from past and present, as well as a wildcard each to add a player not present on the list.</p>
      <p>
        <b>You can view the full episode on Liverpool's official YouTube channel below:</b>

      <p>Neymar was not included among the initial 10 legends, and was overlooked for the wildcards too, with Fabinho choosing Claudio Taffarel and Firmino opting to include Bebeto.</p>
      <p>Neither wildcard made the final selection, however, with Rivaldo, Cafu, Ronaldinho, Ronaldo Nazario and Pele being preferred in Reds duo's final five, with the latter being chosen as the greatest of all time.</p>

      <p>Both Fabinho and Firmino acknowledged that their selection was biased towards more modern players, which explains the absence of legends such as Garrincha, Socrates, Zico and Jairzinho, who were overlooked.</p>
