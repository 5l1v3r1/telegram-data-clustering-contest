Each month highlights an inspirational quote from an iconic Disney movie moment.</p>

New collections will be released the third Saturday of every month. The final collection of 2019 will be released on Saturday, December 7.</p>

      <h3>The Disney Store kicked off the collection in January with “Dumbo.”</h3>

        <figcaption>Each month’s theme will feature a color scheme. January is filled with blues, yellows, and reds. The Dumbo plush retailed for $26.95.<cite>Disney Store, Kirsten Acuna/INSIDER composite</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Each iconic Disney quote is written on the stuffed plush released. January’s quote is a line Dumbo’s friend Timothy Q. Mouse says to the young elephant, “The very things that held you down are going to lift you up, and up, and up.”</p>
      <p>Disney told INSIDER the inspiration for the quotes came from guest responses to the first release in the Mickey Mouse Memories collection. A Walt Disney quote <a href="https://www.mindzai.com/products/disney-mickey-mouse-memories-plush-january-2018-limited-edition">appeared on the mouse’s foot</a> reading, “I only hope that we never lose site of one thing – that it was all started by a Mouse.”</p>
