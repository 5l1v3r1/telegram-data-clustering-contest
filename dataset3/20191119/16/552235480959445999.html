      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:43:38+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:43</time> by <a rel="author">Rachel Clark, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/rachel-clark/</a></address>
      <p>The University of the Highlands and Islands is celebrating 10 years of its student development fund.</p>
      <p>Launched in 2009, it has supported over 400 students to take on personal development opportunities in connection with their course which would otherwise be missed due to financial constraints.</p>
      <p>To mark the occasion, the university has created an online gallery of fund recipients to share their personal journeys.</p>
      <p>Jakub Pesek, a graduate from Perth College UHI, said: “The student development fund helped me a lot during my time studying at the University of the Highlands and Islands.</p>
      <p>“It enabled me to take online courses at Berklee College of Music in Boston.</p>
      <p>“Taking the courses was a great experience.</p>
      <p>“I learnt many skills that will benefit my career in the future and has connected me with some of the best songwriters around the world.</p>
      <p>“The support has meant a lot to me because, without it, I wouldn’t have been able to take part in these really exciting opportunities which have allowed me to grow not only as an artist but also as a person.”</p>
      <p>Grants totalling over £165,000 have been dished out to students at the university over the past decade.</p>
      <p>Alison Wilson, head of development at the University of the Highlands and Islands, said: “This milestone is an ideal time to reflect on what the fund has accomplished.</p>
      <p>“Grants totalling over £165,000 have now been awarded, made possible by kind donations from businesses and individuals.</p>
      <p>“The impact of those gifts has been huge.</p>
      <p>“They have helped our students to feel supported, encouraged, and motivated to succeed.</p>
      <p>“They have provided unforgettable development experiences, opened minds to new ideas and helped develop connections with new people and places.</p>
      <p>“They have allowed students to work in local communities and on research contributing to global social issues.</p>
      <p>“Looking to the future, we want to continue to help many more students access unique learning experiences and we can only do so by securing new donors to fund future rounds of support for our students.</p>
      <p>“No matter what size of donation, it really makes a difference and if any local business or individual feels they would like to help in some small way I’d be delighted to hear from them.”</p>
      <p>Those who want to make a donation to the fund can contact development@uhi.ac.uk</p>
