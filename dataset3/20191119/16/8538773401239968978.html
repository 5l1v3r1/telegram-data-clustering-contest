      <p>TORONTO -- Hockey commentator Don Cherry says the network that fired him "made it impossible" for him to address the comments that led to his dismissal.</p>
      <p>He says on his new podcast that he was unwilling to accept Sportsnet's conditions to have him return following his "Coach's Corner" segment on "Hockey Night in Canada" on Nov. 9.</p>
      <p>Cherry says "two little words just seemed to set everybody off." The 85-year-old broadcaster made remarks many felt were critical of immigrants for not wearing Remembrance Day poppies. Cherry used the phrase "you people." He contends he was not singling out minorities.</p>
      <p>Cherry says he was willing to explain the comment but not apologize. <a href="https://www.espn.co.uk/nhl/story/_/id/28059815/hockey-icon-don-cherry-fired-immigrant-comments">He was fired Nov. 11</a>.</p>
      <p>The 27-minute "Grapevine" podcast features Cherry and son Tim.</p>
