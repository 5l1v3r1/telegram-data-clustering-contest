      <p>The record’s title is also a lyric taken from ‘Crown’, while the artwork sees him looking wistfully at the Banksy-designed bulletproof vest he wore during his Glastonbury 2019 headline set.</p>
      <p>The follow-up to 2017’s ‘<a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/album/stormzy-gang-signs-prayer-album-review">Gang Signs and Prayer</a>‘ comes after the album’s title appeared on the front of Shoreditch High Street Overground Station and St Paul’s Cathedral last night (November 18).</p>
      <p>The same initials also featured at the end of the video for recent release ‘Wiley Flow’.</p>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Speaking at a show in Thorpe Park earlier this month (November 7), the grime star told the crowd: “[At] literally 6am in the morning, I literally finished the final vocal for my [new] album.”</p>
      <p>It caps off a huge year for the rapper, after he made history with a triumphant Glastonbury headline set in June.</p>
      <p>In<a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/live/stormzy-puts-legendary-performance-glastonbury"> a five-star review, NME wrote</a>: “Stormzy’s Glastonbury was a reflection of the time we live in now. Being the second-youngest headliner in the festival’s history and the first black UK solo artist to have such a high billing would have weighed a lot on his shoulders.</p>
      <p>“With anticipation before the night apprehensive, Stormzy does not put a foot wrong throughout. He shows exactly why he deserves to be here. Not too big for his boots, after all.”</p>
