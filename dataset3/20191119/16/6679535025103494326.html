      <h2>Traditional financial functions need to be digitised, feel participants at a conclave</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:56:15+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:56</time> by <a rel="author">Special Correspondent</a></address>
      <p>Indians have been adopting technology and digitisation at a rapid pace. Close to 500 million car rides were booked on mobile apps, payments worth around $25 billion were done on digital apps last year alone, and netizens visited etailing platforms some 120 billion times to buy products and entertainment, as per data released at a CFO Conclave organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) here.</p>
      <p>Speaking at the conclave Suresh Senapathy, Chairman, Honeywell Automation &amp; member of Wipro Enterprise and Wipro GE, said, “We live in an era of disruption where global forces are changing how we live and how we work. Companies that are agile, flexible and adaptable will thrive and the rest will perish.”</p>
      <p>“In today’s environment, supply is in far excess of demand, new business models are forcing companies to innovate, adapt and transform to a digital customer-first world. Therefore, artificial intelligence (AI) is no longer in the future, it is here and now,” said Mr. Senapathy.</p>
      <p>Traditional financial functions need to be digitised to allow CFOs to spend more time in engaging with the business. In the next couple of decades, majority of CFOs would be from technology background, although some CFOs today might think technology was a hype and its impact on businesses was negligible, participants said.</p>
      <p>“Finance has to have a say in all decision making so as to play a major role in charting the organisation’s future. Hence, CFOs need to have a major say in the technology adoption of a company,” said Raghavendran Swaminathan, CFO, Wipro Enterprises.</p>
      <p>Pradip Kanakia, Managing Partner and Assurance Leader, South India, PwC, was of the opinion that CFOs are best placed to drive digital transformation in an organisation as they have touch points with every function in the organisation, they know the systems, they know the processes, and they understand the business.</p>
      <p>“CFOs are now expected to have a holistic strategy for their companies and function as catalysts of transformation in addition to maintaining the financial health of the company. They also need to have the foresight to incorporate technology effectively,” opined Ganesh Shenoy, CFO, MTR Foods.</p>
      <p>As per CII statistics, Indian CFOs today spend only 45% of their time on traditional financial management, 14% on speciality finance and 41% on other important functions such as risk management, performance management, regulatory compliance, strategy and now more importantly on IT, cyber security and digitisation.</p>
