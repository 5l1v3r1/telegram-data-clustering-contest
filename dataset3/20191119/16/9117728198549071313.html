        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/red-bull-racing">Red Bull Racing</a> and Honda have become a force to be reckoned with. Former F1 driver Jolyon Palmer believes that if they can continue the level of performance that we saw in Brazil into next season then they will really be a force to be reckoned with. </b>
      </p>
      <p><i>"Of course it counted for very little in Brazil, but if Red Bull can do what they've so far failed to do in the hybrid era - start the following season as competitive as they finish the last - then the Verstappen/Red Bull/Honda package could be a force to be reckoned with in 2020," </i>Palmer said in his<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/50455347"><i> BBC column. </i></a></p>

        <i>"For Honda in particular, this was a moment that must have caused such joy. It was only four years ago that McLaren drivers Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button publicly mocked them by ironically stepping out onto the Interlagos podium after yet another woeful qualifying display, to the amusement of fans and the bemusement of Honda.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>"In truth, Honda were poor back in 2015. They took a lot of stick, but the unreliability and lack of performance were clear for all to see.</i>

        <i>"Four years later, they are back with two drivers on the same podium, only with none of the mocking irony, just pure ecstatic emotion. A turnaround complete."</i>
      </p>
      <p>Honda's turnaround has been remarkable and if they can continue to perform like this it might be enough to persuade them to stay in the sport post 2020. Max Verstappen will hope that the package next year is competitive and that he can launch a genuine bid on the World Title. </p>
