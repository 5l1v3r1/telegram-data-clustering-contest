        <b>Sarah Sugden (Katie Hill) has been spending a lot of her time in the company of the mysterious Danny (Louis Healy). The young man showed up in Emmerdale several months back, and has only appeared a handful of times on our screens, but it’s clear that Sarah is developing feelings for him. However, his penchant for remaining out of sight —coupled with his <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/emmerdale-spoilers-sarah-sugden-age-danny-charity-11182277/">unacceptable behaviour in tonight’s episode</a> — seems to imply that there’s much more to him than meets the eye.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It’s been something of a tough year for Sarah, as she’s had to come to terms with her serious heart condition. In addition to this, Debbie (Charley Webb) headed off to Scotland to undertake a new business venture when she discovered that Lisa (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jane-cox/">Jane Cox</a>) had left her a garage in her will.</p>
      <p>Since her mum’s departure, Sarah has been living with Charity (Emma Atkins) and Vanessa (Michelle Hardwick), but following their split, things have been incredibly tense at her home, and viewers have seen Sarah continually sneak off to meet up with Danny — <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/16/emmerdale-spoilers-charity-dingle-upsets-sarah-sugden-with-outburst-but-who-is-danny-10747972/">against Charity’s wishes, of course</a>.</p>

      <p>Last week, it became apparent that the two teenagers were in something of a relationship, as Danny kissed her.</p>

      <p>However, it would appear as if there’s a lot more going on here than just a simple friendship — something which will seemingly come to light tonight, as Sarah attends a party with Danny and his mate Jayden.</p>
      <p>Noah’s already become somewhat suspicious of Sarah’s evasive behaviour, and he’s in her presence tonight at the party, as tensions escalate. Yes, things take a turn for the worse when <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/12/emmerdale-spoilers-drugs-horror-for-sarah-sugden-10972144/">Danny and Jayden give Sarah a pill</a> and — feeling the pressure — she takes it and swallows it — leaving Noah horrified.</p>
      <p>Up until now it’s been rather hard to gauge whether Danny was simply Sarah’s friend, or if he had sinister motives — something which can be attributed to the brilliant pacing of this storyline — but if the young man’s putting pressure on her to take drugs, it’s pretty clear that his intentions are anything but honourable.</p>

      <p>Could Danny perhaps be grooming Sarah?</p>
      <p>It’s a huge possibility — one that seems all the more likely given the fact that he supplies her with drugs. What’s more, his actions — not to mention his sinister behaviour, and penchant for remaining out of sight — certainly seem to suggest he’s got plans beyond befriending her.</p>
      <p>If this does prove to be the case, then the other big question is: will she be rescued before it’s too late?</p>
      <p>Noah’s seemingly present at the party tonight as Sarah swallows the pill, so it’s possible that he could do something about it. Perhaps he’ll relay this information back to his mum Charity — who’s voiced her concerns about Danny’s intentions before — and thus she could come to the rescue?</p>

      <p>Either way, Danny’s got a much darker side to him than we initially thought, and Sarah could be in for a lot of trouble as a result.</p>
