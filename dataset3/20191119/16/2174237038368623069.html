      <p><a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/every-def-leppard-album-ranked-from-worst-to-best">Def Leppard</a> have released a video looking back at their momentous 2019.</p>
      <p>It’s been an incredible year for the band, with their <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/def-leppard-celebrated-in-style-at-rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-ceremony">induction into The Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame</a> in March, a European tour complete with headline slot at the UK’s Download festival, a summer tour of Canada, and a 12-date Las Vegas residency at Zappos Theater at Planet Hollywood Resort &amp; Casino.</p>
      <p>The video crams in some of the year’s highlights and features footage of the band meeting fans, conducting radio and TV interviews, hanging out with <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-40-greatest-kiss-songs-as-voted-for-by-you">Kiss</a> star Paul Stanley and <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/how-to-buy-the-very-best-of-bon-jovi">Bon Jovi</a> leader Jon Bon Jovi backstage – and there’s plenty of footage from their live shows, too</p>
      <p>And if 2019’s been busy for the UK favourites, 2020 could be even crazier, with <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/def-leppard-say-emotional-goodbye-to-tour-manager">guitarist Phil Collen saying last week that “next year’s going to be even more bonkers.”</a></p>
      <p>Why? Well, <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/motley-crue-briefly-share-reunion-petition-campaign">there’s the rumoured tour with Motley Crue and Poison</a> which could take place next summer, while guitarist Vivian Campbell said in June that he was hopeful <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/def-leppard-hope-to-release-new-music-in-2020">Def Leppard could record “two or three songs” and release them in 2020</a>.</p>
