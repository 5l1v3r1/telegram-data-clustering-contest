      <h2>RTC unions waiting for copy of HC order on plea for declaring the strike illegal</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:27:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:27</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/Syed-Mohammed-13937/" target="_blank">Syed Mohammed</a></address>
      <p>The TSRTC Joint Action Committee on Tuesday said that the workers strike would continue till they obtain clarity on Telangana High Court’s orders on a batch of petitions seeking declaration of the strike illegal. .</p>
      <p>Speaking to the media after internal deliberations, TSRTC JAC convener E Ashwathama Reddy, flanked by others, including co-convener K Raji Reddy, said, “We have taken everybody’s views. The strike will continue till we receive the order copy of the High Court. Once we receive this, we will sit with our advocate and discuss it. We are expecting to receive the order copy tomorrow. The central committee met today and has decided to abide by the JAC’s decision.”</p>
      <p>Earlier in the day, Telangana Mazdoor Union and TSRTC Employees Union had their own meetings to discuss the way forward.</p>
      <p>Sources who were present at the meetings said that the opinion among workers in connection with continuing the strike was divided. While some were of the opinion that the strike should continue, others were in favour of resuming work.</p>
      <p>“The strike is nearing its 50th day. Workers have not been paid salaries. They do not have other income sources. They have responsibilities to discharge, and loans to repay. Naturally, when the government doesn’t want to listen, they will think of joining duty. While younger workers want to continue striking, others are a little unwilling,” said the source.</p>
      <p>The Chief Minister’s last deadline, November 5, too remains an issue. “We sought information from depot managers on whether this deadline is still in force, or it has been scrapped. They told us they have received no orders of a roll-back of this deadline,” the source said.</p>
      <p>The morale among a section of workers after the High Court hearings, a leader remarked, has dipped. He opined that around a third of the workers are senior staff who have put in at least 20 years of service. “Workers morale was high due to HC’s observations. But now, the matter will be handled by the Labour Commissioner. Senior employees have to marry off their sons and daughters, pay school or college fee. What will the Labour Commissioner say?” he said.</p>
      <p>But, despite these mixed feelings, officebearers of trade unions said that that the workers affirmed them of their unity.</p>
      <p>The TSRTC JAC is likely to announce their future course of action on Wednesday.</p>
