      <h3>Most people and especially politicians know that negatives win votes.</h3>
      <p>For a number of months prior to the election, negatives were spewed. It worked so well that the West voted one way, but failed to send any representatives to Ottawa, nor to elect the leader to be prime minister.</p>
      <p>Now the West wants Ottawa to work for them, to achieve what they want.</p>
      <p>Shouldn’t that be that the West works with Ottawa?</p>
      <p>In any case, it is hoped that success will be achieved in whatever is demanded.</p>
