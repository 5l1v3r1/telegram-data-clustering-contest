      <h1>Amazon Black Friday 2019 deals: today's best offers in their early countdown sale</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:56:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/katie-russell/" target="_blank">Katie Russell</a></address>
      <p>It’s the Godfather of <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/black-friday-2019-deals-when-best-sales-start-uk-shops/">Black Friday</a>. Amazon, the online retailing giant that brought the November sales to the UK, consistently has some of the best deals on electricals, beauty and Amazon-branded products.</p>
      <p>This year, the company will be holding their official Black Friday sales from November 22 — the week before the official Black Friday sales date, on November 29. In a statement, the online retailer claimed it would be their "biggest ever Black Friday sale" and that shoppers will be able to save "tens of millions on thousands of new deals every day".</p>
      <p>Yesterday, Amazon has launched an early round of sales called the Black Friday Countdown. With electric toothbrushes, phones and vacuum cleaners on offer, there is something for everyone. These deals have been split into Deals of the Day (available for 24 hours), Best Deals (promotions that can run for up to two weeks) and Lightning Deals (flash sales that usually last for around six hours.) Yet there are also a number of other sales floating outside these categories — including impressive deals on Amazon products, such as the Echo Dot and the Echo Plus.</p>
      <p>While there are more details of these Black Friday Countdown deals below, we have also analysed trends from last year’s sales to predict some of the best Amazon offers for the main event: Black Friday 2019.</p>
      <p>So, what can we expect the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/0/best-black-friday-deals-2019-uk-what-offers-discounts-where/">best deals</a> to be in the sales? We anticipate that, as in previous years, Amazon will primarily champion deals on their own branded products (Echo, Kindle, Fire TV stick, etc). However, they usually offer great discounts on home tech, laptops, phones and beauty products - so we have included our predictions for these categories, too.</p>
      <h3>Latest news</h3>
      <p>Ahead of their Black Friday sales, which are due to start this Friday, November 22, Amazon has launched its Black Friday Countdown deals — some of which will only last a few hours, while others will last for anywhere between a day and two weeks. </p>
      <p>Over the next two weeks, leading up to the Black Friday sale on November 29, you can expect significant deals on slightly older models — before the main round of fresh deals over Cyber Weekend.</p>
      <p>The brand's much-anticipated '<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/b?ie=UTF8&amp;node=16032496031">Home of Black Friday</a>' customer experience is returning for the third year running in London. From November 28 to December 1, the pop-up destination will offer complimentary workshops, experiences and the chance to try out the season's must-have products. Amazon has announced that rapper Tinie Tempah will perform an intimate concert at their Home of Black Friday event in Lambeth on November 29.</p>
      <h3>The best Amazon Black Friday Countdown deals</h3>
      <p>Launching yesterday, but with fresh deals every day, the following are some of the best Amazon deals on the site today.</p>

        <li><b>Best Deals: </b><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Philips-Sonicare-DiamondClean-Electric-Toothbrush/dp/B01M1OJNUU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?tag=telegraphaffiliate-21&amp;ascsubtag=customid-21">Philips Sonicare DiamondClean Electric Toothbrush, 2019 Edition</a>. This award-wining electric toothbrush has received rave reviews for its strength, with one reviewer saying they could see results within weeks. Amazon is now offering this toothbrush for just £99.99 — down from £299, a saving of over 65 per cent. </li>
        <li><b>Best Deals: </b><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Samsung-Galaxy-Dual-SIM-Android-Smartphone-Prism-White/dp/B07NWP1Z9B/ref=sr_1_1?tag=telegraphaffiliate-21&amp;ascsubtag=customid-21">Samsung Galaxy S10 128 GB Hybrid-SIM Android Smartphone</a>. This smartphone, which is a relatively new model (upstaged only by the S10+), is being offered at a significant discount — at £633.15, down from £799. The Hybrid SIM function allows you to have two phone numbers, which is cost-effective if you go abroad. </li>
        <li><b>Deal of the Day: </b><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Apple-iPhone-256GB-Gold-Renewed/dp/B07N9DX5B9/ref=gbps_ulm_m-8_af24_57b81ec0?tag=telegraphaffiliate-21&amp;ascsubtag=customid-21">Apple iPhone XS Max 256GB Gold (Renewed)</a> With a huge 6.5-inch display, this iPhone is particularly handy for budding photographers. Plus, it has a huge amount of storage, so you won't have to keep deleting apps to make room for more. Today, Amazon is offering the iPhone XS for just £619.95, down from £714.99 — but the deal will expire just before midnight tonight.</li>
        <li><b>Lightning Deal: </b><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ayake-Headphones-Waterproof-Cancelling-Auto-Pairing/dp/B07KY9P9BM/ref=gbps_tit_m-8_af24_0268b851?tag=telegraphaffiliate-21&amp;ascsubtag=customid-21">Ayake Silver O5 Bluetooth 5.0 Headphones</a>. These earbuds are waterproof — which is essential when going for a jog in the UK. They are also noise-cancelling, and have received rave reviews for their good quality sound — although some feel the charging case is a bit on the heavy side. Currently, you can buy a pair of these earbuds for £52.79, down from £99.99.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Amazon-branded products</h3>
      <p>During last year’s Black Friday sales, Amazon offered some hefty discounts on both its new and old-generation products. The year-old Fire HD 8 tablet (and its kids’ edition) were in the sales, as were the Fire TV stick and the year-old second generation of the smart speaker, Echo Spot. The new Kindle Paperwhite was also one of the brand’s top-sellers in the Black Friday sales.</p>
      <p>So, what can we expect from Amazon in the 2019 sales? Already, Amazon has cut prices on the third generation of Echo Dot (which was brand-new in last year’s sales and therefore didn’t have a big discount). Yet we also anticipate that they will reduce the price of the old generation Fire 7 and Fire HD 8 tablets and the new Fire HD 10, as these featured in its End of Summer Sale. </p>

        <img src="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/black-friday/2019/08/31/TELEMMGLPICT000150080452_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=480"/>
        <figcaption>The Amazon Echo Dot is likely to be in the Black Friday sales this year</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>During summer, there were also large discounts on the Fire TV Stick (25 per cent off) and the newer Fire TV Stick 4K (20 per cent off) so we anticipate similar deals for the Black Friday sales. Most of the Kids Edition tablets were significantly reduced, too, with the Fire 7 Kids Edition tablet given a 35 per cent discount, the Fire HD 8 Kids Edition Tablet sold at 27 per cent off, and the new Fire HD 10 Kids Edition tablet with an impressive 28 per cent discount. </p>
      <p>It’s also worth mentioning that the new Echo Show was also in the sale, as were the Echo Plus and Kindle Paperwhite, so we anticipate their inclusion in the Black Friday sales.</p>
      <h3>Laptops and Tablets</h3>
      <p>Last year, Amazon had stellar deals on the 15.6-inch Lenovo IdeaPad, the Microsoft Surface laptop and the Microsoft Surface Pro 6 tablet. This year, the same products will likely be on sale at a discounted price. Already, Amazon is offering up to 25 per cent off laptops and tablets — including a variety of Microsoft Surface models, as well as discounts on a range of ASUS, Acer and HP laptops.</p>
      <p>Currently, for instance, you can buy an <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/ASUS-Chromebook-C223NA-GJ0014-Notebook-Processor/dp/B07HJHMCX2?tag=telegraphaffiliate-21&amp;ascsubtag=customid-21">ASUS Chromebook C223NA</a> for<b> </b>£149, down from £229.99.</p>
      <p>While not in the sales yet, we predict that there will be deals on the Lenovo tablets that were so popular last year — specifically the Lenovo Smart Tab (which comes with Alexa) and the Lenovo YOGA tab because Amazon has already cut these prices. </p>
      <h3>Phones </h3>
      <p>The Samsung Galaxy 9 was a top-seller in last year’s Black Friday sales, and the Galaxy S10 has already been given a discount in the Black Friday Countdown sales. As we get nearer to the official Black Friday date, we predict Amazon will stretch the discounts to the newer S10+ model, too. </p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>We also predict there will be savings on Huawei models — as the new Y6 and Y7 models were discounted (at 16 per cent and 26 per cent, respectively) in Amazon's End of Summer Sales. The new Huawei Mate 20 phone was also reduced, with a significant £300 discount, so we predict this phone will also be on offer for Black Friday 2019. </p>
      <p>Other notable mentions include the Sony Xperia 10 Plus and the Nokia 1, both of which we predict will be in the November sales. </p>
      <h3>Home tech and appliances</h3>
      <p>Juicers, drills, alarm clocks, blenders and printers were all in last year’s sales — and we predict a wave of fresh offers this year. </p>
      <p>Last year, the Oral-B Genius 8000 electric toothbrush was discounted - and we anticipate great deals on other <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/recommended/tech/best-electric-toothbrushes/">electric toothbrushes</a> this year, especially as the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Philips-Sonicare-DiamondClean-Electric-Toothbrush/dp/B01M1OJNUU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?tag=telegraphaffiliate-21&amp;ascsubtag=customid-21">Philips Sonicare DiamondClean Electric Toothbrush, 2019 Edition</a> is already in the sales . </p>
      <p>Home security products also featured heavily in last year’s sales - including the Arlo Pro Security System, and both the Ring Video Doorbell Pro and the Ring Video Doorbell 2. The popular products let you answer the door from anywhere using your iOS or Android smartphone, and are growing in popularity. This year, it's possible both Ring products will be in the sales, as well as other models.</p>
      <p>Probably inspired by the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/12/14/instagram-cleaning-star-mrs-hinch-secures-lucrative-book-deal/">Mrs Hinch revolution</a>, the Shark upright vacuum cleaner was in the sales last year — and we expect the same for 2019, especially as it has featured in the Black Friday Countdown sales. The Shark Upright Vacuum Cleaner Pet Hair model already has a £110 discount on Amazon. Similarly, the iRobot Roomba 960 Robot vacuum cleaner was in the 2018 sales, and we anticipate the newer 981 model to be discounted this year. </p>
      <h3>Beauty products</h3>
      <p>One of last year’s big sellers was the Maybelline No Make Up Make Up Gift Set — probably bought by those who had already started their Christmas shopping. This year, there are likely to be discounts on other gift sets — perhaps the Glow All Night or the Eye Candy sets from Maybelline.</p>
      <p>If you're in the market for a new set of straighteners, the <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/BaByliss-Velvet-Orchid-Hair-Straightener/dp/B077Q6K3NQ?tag=telegraphaffiliate-21&amp;ascsubtag=customid-21">BaByliss Velvet Orchid 235 Hair Straightene</a>r is already being sold at a 63 per cent discount in the Black Friday Countdown sales, now costing just £22.49.  Other potential hair products may include the ghd Original IV Professional styler - as these have been reduced before - and straightners from Remington, which already have a discount. </p>
      <h3>How to shop on Amazon this Black Friday</h3>
      <p>To prepare you for the upcoming havoc of Black Friday, we have collated some tips on how to check in and check out of Amazon, with your basket of deals, as quickly as possible.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Create a membership.</b> Be sure to register as a new customer so you can check out your items as quickly as possible when the deals start. You could even save your card details to really speed up the process.</li>
        <li><b>Sign up for Amazon Prime.</b> Amazon often incentivise their customers by giving Prime members exclusive deals and early access to thousands of ‘lightning deals’ (the ones that usually sell out the fastest) 30 minutes before the rest of the internet.</li>
        <li><b>Get there early.</b> Amazon have been known to launch their Black Friday deals as much as two weeks in advance. Many last-generation tech products pop up during this time, whereas newer ones usually emerge nearer to Cyber Weekend (this year, November 30). </li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Keep track of the Telegraph’s</b><a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/black-friday/">live coverage of Black Friday</a> - so you can find the best deals as soon as they’re on offer. </p>
      <p><b>Check out the ‘Upcoming’ page.</b> When the 2019 offers are released, Amazon’s official Black Friday micro-site should have an ‘Upcoming’ page filled with future offers and the exact time of their launch. If you clikc the ‘Watch this deal’ button on anything listed, the Amazon app will send you a notification for each item’s deal launch.</p>
      <p><b>Pre-fill your basket.</b> Some savvy shoppers swear by pre-filling their baskets with rumoured products so they can check them out as soon as the deals go live. </p>
      <p><b>Shop around.</b> While Amazon does usually have great deals, it doesn’t hurt to browse the Shopping tab on Google for a better deal. </p>
      <p><b>Check Flubit for a better deal.</b> If you've found a product you like on Amazon, and you have a spare couple of hours, enter the URL into the <a href="http://telegraph.digidip.net/visit?url=https%3A%2F%2Fflubit.com%2F&amp;ppref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&amp;currurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.telegraph.co.uk%2Fblack-friday%2F0%2F13-black-friday-shopping-hacks-how-to-shop-online-like-a-pro%2F">Flubit</a> generator - it will tell you if there's a better deal elsewhere on the internet. This can take up to three hours and Flubit, which receives a commission on each deal it facilitates, does sometimes admit that Amazon has the best price on an item. </p>
