      <h2>WARNING: DISTRESSING CONTENT - Joseph McCann is alleged to have tied the children's mother up as he sexually abused them forcing her to listen helplessly, the Old Bailey heard</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:52:12+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:52</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Wilkes, Emily Pennink, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>A teenager has described the look of 'pure evil' on the face of a man accused of sexually abusing her and raping her younger brother.</p>
      <p>Joseph McCann, 34, allegedly tricked his way into a family home in Greater Manchester on May 5 where he is accused of carrying out sex acts on a 17-year-old girl and 11-year-old boy.</p>
      <p>He tied up their mother with hair straighteners and molested the children, saying: "If you move, I will kill your kids," the Old Bailey heard.</p>
      <p>The teen girl told the court how she feared becoming McCann's "sex slave" before she jumped out of a first-floor window and limped to a relative's house.</p>

      <p>"You know when you can see inside someone's eyes and you know they are pure evil," she told the jurors.</p>
      <p>In a video-taped police interview played in the hearing, the teenager described how her attacker had initially grabbed her, put his hand over her mouth and told her to "shut up".</p>
      <p>She said: "I managed to wriggle out of it. He pulled me down onto the floor. That's when he must have knocked me out. His knife must have cut me in a few places.</p>
      <p>"I was shouting 'mum, mum, mum', but at this point he had the knife.</p>
      <p>"My mum was like 'what are you doing?', trying to stop him."</p>
      <p>McCann allegedly tied up the mother for being "gobby" and ordered her not to move.</p>

      <p>The teenager claims he took cocaine and swigged vodka before repeatedly sexually assaulting her and her brother.</p>
      <p>McCann is alleged to have orally raped the 11-year-old.</p>
      <p>Their mother listened helplessly from the room next door, as McCann also allegedly forced the brother and sister to caress his genitals.</p>
      <p>She said: "When I did not do what he said he kept putting the knife up to me.</p>
      <p>"In my head I was trying to think of alternative ways of trying to get out of this situation.</p>
      <p>"I could not do anything about it. Even in the shower, he took the knife with him everywhere he went.</p>
      <p>"He kept brushing it on my skin. That's more like an 'I'm in charge' thing."</p>
      <p>She went on: "I mentioned my brother was 11 and he said 's*** I didn't know that, how old are you?' I said 17.</p>

      <p>"He said me: 'you are going to Europe tomorrow, you are mine'.</p>
      <p>"At this point my life flashed before my eyes. I thought of marriage and everything.</p>
      <p>"I'm going to be his sex slave. I thought, I'm not having this."</p>
      <p>She added: "We kept being held hostage, being abused at knifepoint. It's scary. It's awful."</p>
      <p>The court has heard how the girl fractured her heel when she jumped out of a window naked to escape.</p>
      <p>McCann, from Harrow, west London, denies 37 charges relating to 11 women and children.</p>
      <p>The trial continues.</p>
