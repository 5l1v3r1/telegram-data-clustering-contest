      <p>The 2011 remaster of Master Chief’s first appearance will finally be playable on PC early next year.</p>
      <p>“Once Reach comes out next month, after the holiday, we will start to reset, and we’ll start to flight Halo CE,” community director Brian Jarrard told <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/halo-the-master-chief-collection/halo-ce-pc">PCGamesN</a>. “We’re just going to keep going down the road until we fill out the rest of the collection.”</p>
      <p>Even though the original Halo title has already become available on PC in its original form, this enhanced version offers more than just the standard game. With completely recreated visuals and a host of differences, it’s not a simple release to port to PC.</p>
      <p>The PC version will also benefit from the basic PC standards that we’ve come to know and love.</p>
      <p>“We’re taking a game that’s very old, and we’re trying to update it for this platform – making it run at 60 fps, 4K – but also trying to account for all the requirements that PC gamers expect nowadays,” Jarrad said. “That’s things like uncapped frame rates, an FOV slider, and support for different aspect ratios. It’s been more challenging than we initially thought, and it’s taken longer than we expected. But it is important that we don’t cut corners.”</p>
      <p>Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary PC will hopefully be a solid release.</p>
