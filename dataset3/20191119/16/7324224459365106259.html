      <h2>A key test of the Tories’ popularity in Scotland.</h2>

      <p>The constituency of Stirling, which Nicola Sturgeon visited on Tuesday, is the SNP’s top target at this election.</p>
      <p>Conservative candidate Stephen Kerr is defending a majority of just 148.</p>
      <p>A swing to the SNP of only 0.2% would see the seat change hands.</p>
      <p>It is one of the most marginal constituencies in Scotland – and one of a number of seats the SNP are determined to take from the Conservatives, having lost them at the 2017 election.</p>
      <p>Stephen Kerr won the seat in 2017 on a swing to the Tories of 11.4%.</p>
      <p>The result was so close that a recount was necessary.</p>

      <p>This time the SNP will be hoping for the sort of swing that will see them take Stirling easily, along with the likes of Gordon (2.5%), Angus (3.3%) and Moray (4.4%).</p>
      <p>For the Conservatives, holding seats like Stirling will be a vital test of the party’s popularity in Scotland.</p>
      <p>It would also help to offset potential losses elsewhere in the country.</p>
      <p>Labour held Stirling continuously from 1997 to 2015, but finished third in 2017.</p>
      <p>The party isn’t really in contention this time, as Stirling is now very much a two-horse race.</p>
      <p>Along with the SNP, Conservatives and Labour, the Liberal Democrats and Greens are also standing in the seat.</p>
      <p>Stirling voted 67.7% Remain in the EU referendum – the fourth highest Remain vote in Scotland, and the 20th highest Remain vote in the UK.</p>
