      <p>Gerocare, E-Estate and SimbiBot, technology startups, has proffered solutions to the challenges facing health, property and automotive sectors of the Nigerian economy at Itanna, <b>Honeywell Group’s</b> venture capital programme organised for African startups.</p>
      <p>Prior to the second edition of the event, the <b>three tech startups</b>, who showcased their solutions designed to tame the problems facing the trio sectors, were selected from over 200 applications from innovative founders.</p>
      <p>Applications were received from eight African countries in need of capital investment and the much-needed brand-backing from Honeywell Group, which has been in operation for nearly 50 years.</p>
      <p><b>The acceleration programme</b> was held for four months at Itanna Enterprise Factory in Lagos. Tech startups that participated and made it to the Demo Day (day of pitching and exhibition) got capital investment as well as advisory services from industry experts and mentorship from established tech entrepreneurs.</p>

      <h3>What’s the big deal about Itanna?</h3>
      <p><b>In an interview with two of the startups</b> that presented at the Demo Day, Nairametrics was told that the investment wasn’t the motivating factor, rather, it was the value the Honeywell brand would have on their portfolio.</p>
      <p>
        <b>According to Ogunjobi of SimbiBot,<i> </i></b>
        <i>“We applied to Itanna because we needed an acceleration programme and after looking around, we saw the value we could get from Itanna knowing fully well that it’s an extension of Honeywell and Honeywell is a giant company in Africa.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“And I also heard it’s (Honeywell) passionate about education, so those are things we factored in before applying. And on getting the application and the interview stage, we also saw the value we also get from the mentors and their network which made us so particular about this acceleration.”</i>

      <p><b>Also speaking about the reason </b>for applying, Lucas, the Chief Technical Officer of GeroCare said, <i>“We did a due analysis of what we needed to grow, and most of the things we needed to grow was not funds at that time because we had funds from venture platforms but lack the right network, which Itanna provides.”</i></p>
