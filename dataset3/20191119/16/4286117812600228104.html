      <h4>HIGHLIGHTS</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Virat Kohli among 5 players in the squad with no pink-ball experience</li>
        <li>Mayank Agarwal shone in Duleep Trophy 2016 that was played with pink ball</li>
        <li>Ravindra Jadeja took 10 wickets with the pink ball in Duleep Trophy 2016 final</li>
      </ul>
      <p>India are gearing up to play their 1st ever pink-ball Test at Eden Gardens Kolkata from November 22. Bangladesh will be their opposition in the much-anticipated clash that comes after India thrashed the tourists by an innings and 130 in the 1st of the ongoing 2-match Test series.</p>
      <p>The 1st ever day-night Test was played between Australia and New Zealand in 2015 and 11 pink-ball Tests have been played since but India had stayed away from the experimental format until Sourav Ganguly took over as Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) president.</p>
      <p>India had said no to Australia and West Indies in the past when they came forward to host India in day-night Tests. Also, India also missed out on a chance to host in the 2016-17 season.</p>
      <p>Over the years, the Indian team management had cited lack of pink-ball exposure for their inhibition to play day-night Tests. However, Sourav Ganguly said Virat Kohli readily agreed to his request to play the upcoming pink-ball Test against Bangladesh.</p>
      <p>In India, there are only a handful of pink-ball matches that have been played so far. Duleep Trophy, India's 4-day cricket tournament, was played with the pink ball for three seasons. The 1st ever pink-ball cricket match played in India was the Cricket Association of Bengal Super League Final played at the Eden Gardens in 2016.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Here's a look at how India cricketers have fared in pink-ball cricket</b>
      </p>
      <p>Firstly, captain Virat Kohli has no competitive pink-ball experience. Vice-captain Ajinkya Rahane, off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin and pacer Umesh Yadav also have no pink-ball exposure. Shubman Gill completes the group of 5 players which has zero competitive pink-ball experience in the India squad.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Rohit Sharma</b>
      </p>
      <p>Rohit Sharma played the final of Duleep Trophy 2016 -- the first edition of the tournament that was played with the pink ball. Rohit scored 30 and 32 for India Blue in their massive 355-run win over India Red at Greater Noida.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Mayank Agarwal</b>
      </p>
      <p>In-form opener Mayank Agarwal was the star of India's 1st experiment with the pink ball. Mayank scored 161 for India Blue and shone in the final as well with 2 half-centuries.</p>
      <p>Mayank amassed a total of 419 runs from 5 innings with scores of 92, 161, 58, 57, 52 -- not a single score less than fifty in pink-ball cricket. He is certainly the one to watch out for in India's inaugural pink-ball Test.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Cheteshwar Pujara</b>
      </p>
      <p>Pujara, as expected, found success in the pink-ball format as well. Pujara scored 2 daddy hundreds. His score of 256 helped India Blue win the Duleep Trophy in 2016. It is also the highest score in pink-ball cricket by an India batsman.</p>
      <p>Pujara ended the 2016 Duleep Trophy season with scores of 166, 31, 256.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Virat Kohli</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hasn't played a competitive pink-ball match yet.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Ajinkya Rahane</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hasn't played a competitive pink-ball match yet.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Wriddhiman Saha</b>
      </p>
      <p>Even though Wriddhiman Saha was not part of pink-ball Duleep Trophy matches, the wicketkeeper-batsman took part in the historic CAB Super League final.</p>
      <p>Playing for Mohun Bagan Bhowanipore, Saha scored 33 in the 1st innings but was dismissed for 0 in the second.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Ravindra Jadeja</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ravindra Jadeja was also part of the 2016 Duleep Trophy season. He shone with two 5-wicket hauls with the pink ball in the final for India Blue. Jadeja also chipped in with the bat scoring 48 and 17 in the season. It was a dream outing for the India spinner who finished the match with figures of 171/10.</p>
      <p>R Ashwin</p>
      <p>Hasn't played a competitive pink-ball match yet.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Umesh Yadav</b>
      </p>
      <p>Hasn't played a competitive pink-ball match yet.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Mohammed Shami</b>
      </p>
      <p>Like his Bengal teammate Wriddhiman Saha, Mohammed Shami was also part of the historic CAB Super League final. Shami was at the top of his game in the pink-ball match and was nearly unplayable under lights. He took a 5-wicket haul and was declared the Man of the Match of the CAB Super League final.</p>
      <p>Shami shone with figures of 5/42, 2/82 for Mohun Bagan and hit 27 from 16 balls as well.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Ishant Sharma</b>
      </p>
      <p>Pacer Ishant Sharma played 1 match in Duleep Trophy 2017 and managed to pick up a wicket. He also chipped in with the bat, scoring 9 runs for India Blue in Kanpur.</p>
      <p>Apart from them, <b>Kuldeep Yadav, Rishabh Pant and Hanuma Vihari </b>also have competitive pink-ball experience.</p>
      <p>Kuldeep shone in the 2016 Duleep Trophy, picking up 11 wickets while Hanuma Vihari scored 105 in the only Duleep Trophy pink-ball match he featured in 2017.</p>
      <p>Rishabh Pant, who is in the India squad, managed scores of 11, 15 and 46 in Duleep Trophy 2017.</p>
