      <p>A former home secretary has said she was left “slack-jawed” by alleged racist comments by the Duke of York.</p>
      <p>Jacqui Smith, who served at the Home Office under Tony Blair, said Andrew made racist comments about Arab people during a state dinner.</p>
      <p>The claims come after the duke’s Newsnight interview in which he discussed his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and denied sleeping with one of Epstein’s victims, Virginia Giuffre.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the LBC election podcast she hosts with Iain Dale, Ms Smith said Andrew’s remarks to her “involved a comment about camels” and were “as worse as you could imagine”.</p>

      <p>Ms Smith said: “I met him several times, including once at a state banquet where, after dinner, I and my husband and another Labour cabinet minister had a drink with him.</p>
      <p>“I have to say the conversation left us slack-jawed with the things that he felt it was appropriate to say.”</p>
      <p>The former Labour politician made the comments in Sunday’s podcast episode, and said she did not feel comfortable repeating what the duke said, adding: “It was a state dinner for the Saudi royal family and he made racist comments about Arabs that were unbelievable.”</p>
      <p>Describing Andrew as “the worst end of the royal family”, Ms Smith added: “The fact he thought we might find these amusing was sort of a terrible situation to be in.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think he’s very bright, I don’t think he really understands the way in which he behaves.”</p>

      <p>She also said she feels “ashamed” that she did not challenge the Queen’s son on his comments.</p>
      <p>Responding to the claims, a Buckingham Palace spokesman said: “HRH has undertaken a considerable amount of work in the Middle East over a period of years and has many friends from the region.</p>
      <p>“He does not tolerate racism in any form.”</p>
      <p>On Monday, the Evening Standard published on its front page a claim by columnist Rohan Silva that the duke made a racist remark while he was a Downing Street aide specialising in the tech economy.</p>
      <p>Mr Silva told the newspaper that when he asked Andrew if the government department responsible for trade “could be doing a better job”, the duke replied: “Well, if you’ll pardon the expression, that really is the n***** in the woodpile.”</p>
      <p>Sources have categorically denied Andrew used the word.</p>
