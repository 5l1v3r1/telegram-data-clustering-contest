      <h2>Perth Theatre on the hunt for plastic bottles</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:21:36+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:21</time> by <a rel="author">Melanie Bonn, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/melanie-bonn/</a></address>
      <p>Perth Theatre’s box office is expecting to soon be awash with plastic bottles if the Fair City public takes up a request for drinks containers to get a second life as part of the Perth panto.</p>
      <p>The theatre is on the lookout for used plastic bottles, asking for them to be handed in to be recycled as part of the set for the festive adventure, ‘Sinbad’.</p>
      <p>The panto team needs rinsed-out, clear, blue or green 2lt size plastic bottles and smaller.</p>
      <p>They will play a starring role in the panto which opens on November 29.</p>
      <p>“We wanted to highlight the importance of recycling, reusing and repurposing,” explained Barrie Hunter, who not only plays Dame Jackie Alltrades, but has written the script and is directing Sinbad.</p>
      <p>“We have done this in elements of the set and costumes.</p>
      <p>“And I’ve most definitely done so in the script - I’ve been recycling the same ‘trumpet tree’ joke for the last eight years!”</p>
      <p>Barrie’s Dame Jackie Alltrades is joined by daughter Sinbad, son Finn Lad and young nature-lover Greta on a journey to save the Tayside beavers, with all the usual high spirits in this year’s family panto.</p>
      <p>Designer Becky Minto said: “We have re-purposed and recycled from last year’s panto where we could.</p>
      <p>“Our wardrobe department have been having a great time, digging out some costumes from pantos past, and working their magic on them, giving them a Sinbad-themed look and feel.”</p>
      <p>Sinbad is in Perth Theatre from Friday, November 29 until Saturday, January 4.</p>
      <p>Tickets can be bought from the box office on 01738 621031 or <a href="http://www.horsecross.co.uk/">www.horsecross.co.uk</a></p>
