        <b>Lionel Messi is arguably that best footballer in the world considering his achievements in football since he started his career at the Camp Nou.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Messi is a one-man team as he has never played for any other club before in his career except Barcelona where he has won five Ballon d'Or awards.</p>
      <p>He has won all major trophies at Barcelona, but Lionel Messi has failed to turn his success at club side to the national team</p>
      <p>Recently, the 32-year-old had a<a href="https://www.legit.ng/1277035-argentina-uruguay-edinson-cavani-lionel-messi-involved-bust-up.html"> bust-up with Edinson Cavani</a> while playing for Argentina against Uruguay in which the PSG star offered the Argentine a fight which he agreed.</p>
      <p>However, this is not the first time Lionel Messi has been involved in a controversy on the pitch as we take a look at five other incidents.</p>
      <p>
