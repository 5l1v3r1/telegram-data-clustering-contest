      <h1>The Scandi-style log cabin complete with sauna in the heart of the Welsh countryside</h1>
      <h2>A little slice of authentic Scandinavia</h2>

      <p>When Kal Barker's parents got married one of the most important first tasks for his dad was to build his new Finnish wife a sauna; in their Cheshire farmhouse.</p>
      <p>Kal explains: "The sauna was Mum's first request after getting married, it is a must-have in any Finnish home.</p>
      <p>"Traditionally homes in Finland didn't have a bathroom as such, instead they bathed in the sauna with a wooden bucket of water and ladle.</p>
      <p>"The sauna experience is also a time for the family to spend time together."</p>

      <p>And it was one of the first design aspects of the new home that the couple, with help from family and friends, built from scratch when they moved to a secluded plot of land surrounded by glorious Welsh countryside in 1986.</p>
      <p>Kal, now 56, comments: "Our Finnish mother and British father built this cabin after retiring from farming in Cheshire because our mother wanted to live in a warm, dry and bright cabin after living 25 years in a cold, damp and dark farmhouse."</p>

      <p>When wandering around this unique 'log cabin' home near <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/wrexham">Wrexham</a> called Tupa, the design of the ground floor illustrates just how important the sauna was to the family, with the inclusion of a dedicated sauna room, shower room and adjacent drying room.</p>
      <p>Kal says the farmhouse sauna had a wood burning stove but in their Welsh home the sauna is heated by an electric stove.</p>
      <p>He says: "Although not considered as authentic as wood it is a lot more practical for a quick visit to the sauna without the need to wait!"</p>

      <p>The cosy and warm atmosphere created by the cabin, plus the design and materials used when building it, reminded Kal's mother of her homeland and it wasn't just the sauna and aesthetic look of the home that appealed to all the family.</p>
      <p>Kal explains: "The living room is my favourite area because it is a spacious open-plan area with a high ceiling and fireplace.</p>
      <p>"The meaning of 'tupa' in Finnish is this actual area, which is the focal point of any home in Finland.</p>
      <p>"Traditionally the sleeping areas were alcoves off the 'tupa' with curtains for privacy. That way only one room needed to be heated during the long winters in Finland."</p>

      <p>The charming log cabin has truly unique character throughout, from the open-plan living area that Kal loves through to the dining room, kitchen, bathroom and two spacious bedrooms.</p>
      <p>Inside the <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/interior-design">interior design</a> creates a classic Scandi-look, totally authentic having been designed by a family with Finnish roots.</p>
      <p>The home has all the characteristics of a charming log cabin, with a stone open fireplace and wooden floors, walls and ceilings combining with classic, simple furniture and atmospheric lighting.</p>
      <p>All rooms have engaging views of the surrounding countryside that make visitors and owners alike want to linger and enjoy.</p>

      <p>Perhaps one of the most special spots to relax and enjoy the beautiful and peaceful surroundings is the veranda.</p>
      <p>From here a new owner can scan the 1.13 acres of garden with pretty pond, orchard, paddocks and woodland that comes with the sale.</p>
      <p>There is also the option to purchase a further 2.69 acres of land should a potential buyer want to expand the small-holding.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>There is sunny patio that is definitely the perfect place for a family and friend's BBQ, cleverly using the outside stone structure of the fireplace chimney, before exploring the beauty of the home's surroundings.</p>
      <p>Kal says the home was not built here by accident: "My parents chose this location because it meant they could live in seclusion.</p>
      <p>"Tupa is on the grounds of the former Penley Hall on the edge of the village of Penley. Only the butler's quarters remain of Penley Hall which is a distance from Tupa. There are no properties within viewing distance from the cabin itself."</p>

      <p>Kal will be sad when the little slice of Finland in Wales that he and his family created is sold, but it is now time to move on and for the unique home and idyllic location to be enjoyed by someone else.</p>
      <p>Kal says he and his sister Tarja Wilson will miss both the house and the land.</p>
      <p>He comments: "Everybody who visits the cabin loves it here and wants to stay or live here.</p>
      <p>"Inside the cabin it's really cosy and feels like a wonderland. Outside the cabin is only nature and it feels like the middle of nowhere."</p>
      <p>
