      <p>A group of school children have prevented council workers from removing Extinction Rebellion warnings over rising flood levels in Exeter.</p>
      <p>Max Brady Hughes, aged 12, has missed school and been standing guard at Duckes Meadow since this morning to prevent the signs - which show how high water levels could be in the city in years to come - being removed.</p>
      <p>Extinction Rebellion emblems are also visible on some of the tree stumps.</p>

      <p>Max's dad, Caspar, said he was proud of Max's efforts to raise the issue of climate change.</p>
      <p>"I am very proud, incredibly proud," he said. "Max and some friends have stayed there and the council have stopped.</p>
      <p>"I was working in the library and I got a phone call from Max saying 'the council were trying to remove the flood level warnings and I am going to step them'.</p>
      <p>"They were pressure-washing the tree next to her and had to stop in the end as Max refused to move.</p>
      <p>"The council were trying to get rid of them. They were being very patronising saying ‘you can tell your little friends about your little protest’ but that gave Max the resolve to stay all day. The school rang and were supportive, surprisingly.</p>
      <p>"When Isca Academy rang this morning, they said good on Max and it was good to take a stand."</p>

      <p>Extinction Rebellion have since confirmed they were behind the signs, which they finished working on yesterday afternoon.</p>
      <p>They claim it was based on data in the New Scientist - and the overwhelming feedback from the public had been positive.</p>

      <p>"It is taking scientific facts and this shows what will happen in terms of climate change and rising sea levels," said a spokesperson.</p>
      <p>"They have been put on very safely with no sharp edges.</p>
      <p>"It made a lot of people stop and talk and say it is a good sign of what is coming. Many have said we need to do something about this before part of Exeter is underwater. Almost everybody was positive about it.</p>
      <p>"When the council have declared a climate emergency, it seems a bit of a contradiction really that they would try and remove them really."</p>

      <p>Caspar agreed, saying people had been supportive of the protest.</p>
      <p>"The council are hiding behind safety issues. They are metal signs sealed on the edges so they are safe but the council are saying they are dangerous and scary – but people need to be scared because Exeter being underwater is a scary prospect," he said.</p>
      <p>"Members of the public stopped to see what was going on – they very kindly left and came back down with a cup of hot chocolate."</p>

      <p>Exeter City Council confirmed they had received a complaint about the 'criminal damage' and insisted it would be removed.</p>
      <p>An Exeter City Council spokesperson said: “Whilst we sympathise with the sentiment behind the action – we too have declared a climate emergency –  we do not however support criminal damage to achieve those aims.</p>
      <p>“In Exeter we carry out the removal of graffiti throughout the city. This particular graffiti was reported to us by a member of the public and will therefore be removed by our team.”</p>
