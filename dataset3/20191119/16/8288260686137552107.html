      <h1>‘Don't know what you're doing’ - Arsenal legend uses Aston Villa to slam Unai Emery</h1>
      <h2>Latest Aston Villa news | AVFC lost 3-2 against Arsenal at The Emirates</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:52:53+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:52</time> by <a rel="author">Shane Ireland, https://www.facebook.com/ShaneIrelandJournalist</a></address>
      <p>Lee Dixon has drawn on Aston Villa’s 3-2 defeat at The Emirates to urge Arsenal’s players to confront manager Unai Emery over a lack of tactical nous.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-abo">Villa</a> twice went ahead in North London in September with John McGinn opening the scoring before Wesley Moraes made it 2-1 after Nicolas Pepe equalised with a penalty.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/dean-smith">Dean Smith’s</a> side returned to Villa Park with nothing to show for their efforts <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/arsenal-aston-villa-highlights-goals-16959913">despite dominating the hosts in the first-half.</a></p>
      <p>And Arsenal legend Dixon says that game, even though his former side won after capitalising on Villa’s defensive mistakes in the second period, was symptomatic of the kind of tactical problems Emery is struggling with this season.</p>

      <p>"From [having] a shot at one end to conceding a penalty at the other end in the space of 20 seconds - that cannot happen, that has to stop," he said on The Season So Far.</p>
      <p>"Now that game was Watford - I could have done [Aston] Villa at home, I could have done Liverpool away when he played a narrow midfield and let the Liverpool full-backs run the game.</p>
      <p>"I could have picked any number of games and done the same analysis and just overlaid it onto the pitch. "It's happening every week - that has to stop and the players have got to go 'We don't know what you're doing gaffer, can we change it? Can we change something?'</p>
      <p>"But there's no leaders in that team, there's no Patrick Vieira to go 'boss can we change the system or something?'. Unai is banging the drum about how he wants to play and the players can't do it."</p>
