      <p>It's something of a grey area when it comes to putting the rubbish out and Newcastle City Council has revealed some changes as to what rubbish goes into what bin right in time for Christmas, when we're all sure to have plenty of extra things to dispose of.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.newcastle.gov.uk/services/environment-and-waste/recycling-rubbish-and-waste/what-goes-each-bin">council website</a> , all residents of Newcastle have a responsibility to ensure that all of their rubbish and waste is disposed of properly. Under the Household Waste Duty of Care (section 34(2A) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990), residents are required to take reasonable measures to ensure that waste produced on their property is only passed on to an authorised person.</p>
      <p>And changes have recently been made as to what can be recycled, so here is a full break down of what waste should go in what colour bin...</p>
      <h3>Green bin: household waste</h3>
      <p>Your green wheelie bin is for household and food waste, and waste that cannot be recycled. Please bag all waste that goes in this bin in either black bags , carrier bags or bin liner bags.</p>
