      <p>This video shows the horrific moment a man was caught punching a dog in the face.</p>
      <p>The sickening video shows Robert Black, 51, hitting his dog several times in the face with "significant cruelty" and "no concern for its welfare."</p>
      <p>The horrific act took place on December 21, 2018, where Black, of Parsons Close, Newbury, was seen on CCTV with two dogs in Victoria Park.</p>

        <figcaption>Both of his dogs have since been rehomed.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Reading Magistrates’ Court heard how after striking his dog five times while gripping it tightly by the collar, Black then put the dog on a lead and walked off through the park.</p>
      <p>Police were notified of the incident and carried out an area search before locating Black, arresting him and seizing both of his dogs under the Animal Welfare Act 2006.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, the dog which was punched by Black was not injured during the attack.</p>
      <p>Both of his dogs have since been rehomed.</p>

        <figcaption>The thug has also been banned from owning animals for 10 years.</figcaption>

      <p>Black was found guilty of one count of causing unnecessary suffering to a protected animal at Reading Magistrates’ Court on Tuesday, November 12.</p>
      <p>He was sentenced to a total of 23 weeks’ imprisonment and made to pay a £115 victim surcharge.</p>
      <p>He has also been banned from owning animals for 10 years.</p>

      <p>Investigating officer, PC David Burleigh, based at Abingdon police station, said: “Black demonstrated significant cruelty to his dog by punching it several times in the face, with no concern for its welfare.</p>
      <p>“This behaviour is clearly totally unacceptable for a pet owner and I am pleased that not only has he received a prison sentence for his actions, but that he has been banned from owning animals for the next 10 years.</p>
      <p>“We take reports such as these seriously and will look to investigate and take action against anyone who carries out this type of offence.”</p>
