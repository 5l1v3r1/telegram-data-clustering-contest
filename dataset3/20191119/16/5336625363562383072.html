      <p><b>TL;DR:</b> <a href="https://zdcs.link/GboO8">Electric toothbrushes</a> from Oral-B and Philips Sonicare are on sale at Walmart — save up to $30, plus snag an additional rebate.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>While big gifts are usually the ones that someone has asked for, <a href="https://mashable.com/gifts/best-stocking-stuffers/">stocking stuffers</a> are the ones that aren't necessarily exciting but that will come in clutch eventually.</p>
      <p>An <a href="https://mashable.com/shopping/best-electric-toothbrushes-oral-b-philips-sonicare/">electric toothbrush</a> is a prime example.</p>
      <p>We doubt anyone had a new toothbrush at the top of their list, but they'll sure as hell be thankful they have one when they realize they're no longer spending $10 on a new disposable toothbrush every month. Skipping disposable toothbrushes (which take up to 400 years to decompose) is also an easy way to <a href="https://mashable.com/shopping/eco-friendly-grooming-products/">become a more eco-friendly household</a> without changing any routines.</p>
      <p>Walmart has a nice selection of well-reviewed <a href="https://zdcs.link/GboO8">toothbrushes from Oral-B and Philips Sonicare on sale</a> ahead of Black Friday, and most come with an extra coupon or rebate.</p>
      <h3><a href="https://zdcs.link/Np7kB">Philips Sonicare Essence 1 Series Toothbrush</a> — $19.95 (save $20)</h3>

      <p>It only makes sense that pearly whites are taken care of with a gorgeous, pearly toothbrush. The Essence series by Philips Sonicare starts with a gentle pace to get gums used to the bristles, then speeds up and uses the angled neck to sweep those hard-to-reach spots. It'll tell you when your two minutes of brushing are up, and the battery lasts for two weeks on one charge. </p>

      <p>Shopping for two? This double pack gets you two of one of the best affordable toothbrushes for less than $75 — plus an extra $15 rebate available. The Oral-B Pro 1000 uses a CrossAction brush head to clear away up to 300% more plaque than a manual toothbrush (apparently). The included brush can be swapped out for more precise cleaning like floss action or sensitive gum care.</p>

      <p>If your dentist has expressed concerns greater than "Have you been flossing?", perhaps a more robust daily cleaning process is necessary. The Philips Sonicare Flexcare+ uses patented sonic technology and five cleaning modes to gently clean gums and prevent inflammation while hitting the hard-to-reach gumline spots to protect against gingivitis. All of these can be chosen via the LED panel on the brush handle.</p>
