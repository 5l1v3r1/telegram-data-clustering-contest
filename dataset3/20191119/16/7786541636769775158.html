      <p><b>DUBAI, United Arab EmiratesÂ (AP)</b> - The Latest on protests in Iran (all times local):</p>
      <p>8:15 p.m.</p>
      <p>Amnesty International, citing "credible reports," says it believes at least 106 people have been killed during protests in Iran over government-set gasoline prices rising.</p>
      <p>Amnesty made the allegation in a report released Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Iran's government, which has not made nationwide numbers available for the toll of the unrest that began Sunday, did not immediately respond to the report.</p>
      <p>Amnesty added that it "believes that the real death toll may be much higher, with some reports suggesting as many as 200 have been killed."</p>
      <p>Iran since has shut down the internet and deployed police and anti-riot forces to quell the unrest. Demonstrations are believed to still be going on in the country.</p>

      <p>A hard-line newspaper in Iran is suggesting that those who led violent protests will be executed by hanging as the unrest continues.</p>
      <p>An article published Tuesday in the Keyhan newspaper made the claim, though Iranian authorities still have not offered a detailed accounting of the toll of the demonstrations that began Friday over government-set gasoline prices rising.</p>
      <p>The newspaper said: "Some reports say that judiciary considers execution by hanging for the riot leaders a definite punishment."</p>
      <p>It did not elaborate.</p>
      <p>The protests appeared to be ongoing on Tuesday in some areas of the country, though the streets of Tehran appeared largely calm.</p>
      <p>It remains difficult to know the scale of the demonstrations. Iran shut down the internet Saturday, stopping protesters from sharing information and their videos online.</p>
