      <p>Rapman has opened up on the pressure to follow his viral sensation Shiro’s Story, admitting he knows his new movie Blue Story isn’t ‘what the people want’.</p>
      <p>The YouTube star, who shot to fame after his series which combines rapping and filmmaking in a unique style, is about to release his debut feature film.</p>
      <p>Focusing on horrific violence between gangs in Lewisham and Peckham, the star revealed it’s the story that’s closest to his heart.</p>

      <p>Speaking to <b>Metro.co.uk</b>, he said: ‘Everyone – every single person, even some now – wants Shiro’s Story.</p>

      <p>‘Blue Story was like 2013 so they’re like “You’ve just done this thing that’s trending all over the world, why are you doing something else? That’s a bit weird, why are you not doing what the people want?”</p>
      <p>‘I said, “Well the people want that because that’s what they know about. If I give them something else that’s good then they’re gonna want that. Just be confident that I’m going to give them something high quality.” And I knew that [Blue Story] was closer to my heart.’</p>
      <p>As for whether he’ll ever release a Shiro’s Story feature film, he’s optimistic.</p>
      <p>‘A Shiro’s Story three parter on YouTube and Shiro’s Story film – it would have been great and I still might touch on it eventually, maybe a year, the year after next,’ he considered.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, he insisted: ‘Right now, as soon as I had the platform, I knew this is what I wanted to do.’</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Shiro’s Story was released back in 2018, with the filmmaker spending his last bit of money on production.</p>
      <p>‘I remember saying if it gets a million views, I’ll do part two, thinking I’ll never get a million views,’ he said, with each of the videos soon reaching upwards of seven million each.</p>
      <p>‘Next thing I know I’m here.’</p>
