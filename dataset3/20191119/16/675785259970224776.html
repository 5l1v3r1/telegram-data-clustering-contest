      <p>Speaking about the decision to go early with deals this year, Zeena Hill, Go To Market Planning Director for Dixons Carphone says: “Each year, Black Friday continues to prove itself as a key shopping date for customers. At Currys PC World, we’re pleased to give shoppers an opportunity to purchase amazing technology at great prices now, ahead of the rush on 29th November.”</p>
      <p>But Currys has caused a stir when it unveiled deals last week after accidentally <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/currys-price-glitch-sees-ipads-20871426">slashing the price of coveted iPads down to £4 in a price glitch</a>. What was meant to be a £30 discount on the case actually knocked hundreds off the price, but instead of receiving the bargain steal shoppers were refunded instead. </p>
      <h3>Does the Currys Price Guarantee work over Black Friday?</h3>
      <p>Under the Currys Price Guarantee shoppers won't have to hold out until 29 November to get the best price for coveted items they purchase.</p>
      <p>Under the pledge, Currys will refund any items bought now in the 'Why Wait' deals that go down further on Black Friday .</p>
      <p>
        <b>How it works?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Currys will price match any items before you buy against the price of any UK rival retailer - whether you spot it in store or online - and the chain will even price match against discount code offers.</p>
      <p>Shoppers can pop into store or contact Currys customer service teams online or via telephone - check details online at <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=76202X1526515&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.currys.co.uk%2Fgbuk%2Fprice-promise-1023-theme.html&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirror.co.uk%2Fmoney%2Fshopping-deals%2Fcurrys-black-friday-2019-deals-20868975">currys.co.uk/price-promise</a>.</p>
      <p>You can also price match on items you've bought up to a week afterwards and the chain will refund the difference.</p>
      <h3>What happened in 2018?</h3>
