      <h1>Penn State QB Sean Clifford Reveals Why He Deleted Social Media</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:52:24+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>Penn State quarterback Sean Clifford made the decision to delete social media off his phone following the Nittany Lions’ loss to Minnesota two weeks ago.</p>
      <p>Today, Clifford explained his reasoning for doing so to reporters. The quarterback says he was receiving death threats.</p>
      <p>Clifford was 23-of-43 passing for 340 yards, one touchdown and three interceptions against the Gophers. The final INT came in the end zone with one minute remaining in the game.</p>

      <p>To be fair, there are plenty of Penn State fans responding to tweets about Clifford’s admission with nothing but support for the player and condemnation for anyone sending him threats.</p>
      <p>However, there have been a couple of instances this season where some PSU fans have drawn negative attention to themselves. Earlier this fall, one fan sent safety Jonathan Sutherland <a href="https://thespun.com/big-ten/penn-state-nittany-lions/penn-state-football-fan-letter-hair-tattoos-jonathan-sutherland">a nasty, racially-tinged letter</a> complaining about the team captain’s tattoos and dreadlocks.</p>
      <p>Head coach James Franklin even <a href="https://www.pennlive.com/pennstatefootball/2019/11/penn-states-james-franklin-discusses-some-of-the-challenges-of-interacting-with-the-nittany-lions-spirited-fan-base.html">admitted last week</a> he had “heard from” some disappointed fans after the loss to Minnesota.</p>
      <p>Overall though, this isn’t a Penn State issue so much as its a society issue in 2019. With the advent of social media–and its ability to provide someone anonymity, or at least to be able to fire shots from a safe distance–we’ve seen countless instances of people going too far.</p>
