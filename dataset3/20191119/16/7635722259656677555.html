        <b>Two prison officers who were tasked with guarding the disgraced US billionaire Jeffrey Epstein on the night he died in his cell are set to be charged.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b><a href="https://apnews.com/f887ca30493b412896c6a46eb60836d2?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=AP">According to the Associated Press (AP)</a>,</b> the workers at the Metropolitan Correctional Centre in New York are to be charged with falsifying prison records - the first criminal charges in connection with Epstein's death.</p>
      <p>The pair - who have reportedly turned down the offer of a plea bargain - are suspected of failing to check on the convicted sex offender every half-hour and of fabricating log entries to make it look as though they had.</p>
      <p>They were working overtime because of staffing shortages when Epstein was found on August 10th, less than a month after he was placed on suicide watch after he was found on his cell floor with bruises on his neck.</p>
      <p>AP reports that Epstein was taken off suicide watch about a week before he died - meaning he was less closely monitored, but he was still supposed to be checked every 30 minutes.</p>
      <p>Epstein was due to go on trial accused of sexually abusing teenage girls at the time of his death, the official cause of which was given as suicide by hanging.</p>
      <p>It has since been claimed by forensic pathologist Michael Baden, who was hired by Epstein's brother, that he more likely died from being strangled, with multiple fractures found in his neck.</p>

      <p>Several conspiracy theories have been borne out of Epstein's death, which ended the possibility of a high-profile trial many hoped would involve prominent figures within his celebrity social circle.</p>
      <p>Epstein had pleaded not guilty to sexually abusing girls and other young women in New York and Florida, with his alleged crimes having taken place in the early 2000s.</p>
      <p>Around a decade before the charges were filed, Epstein (66) evaded a potential life jail sentence after dozens of women accused him of sexual assault.</p>
      <p>He avoided federal charges thanks to a plea deal struck by then-US attorney Alexander Acosta, who went on to become labour secretary under President Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>In 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty to lesser state charges on two counts of soliciting prostitution from a minor, which saw him registered as a sex offender and handed an 18-month sentence, of which he served 13 months.</p>
      <p>Despite his death, prosecutors have vowed to continue investigating any further allegations made against Epstein and to charge anyone who may have helped him.</p>

      <p>On Monday, a woman who claims to have been trafficked and abused by Epstein announced her intention to file a lawsuit against him.</p>
      <p>Speaking at a press conference alongside lawyer Gloria Allred, the unnamed woman said she hoped that speaking out would encourage others to come forward.</p>
      <p>She also called on Britain's Prince Andrew to speak to US law officials about his friendship with Epstein.</p>
      <p>Ms Allred said: "Given that he was in so many of the homes and locations Mr Epstein was in, he does have valuable information that he could provide to law enforcement."</p>
      <p>It came after Prince Andrew - a son of Queen Elizabeth II - <b><a href="https://www.newstalk.com/news/britains-prince-andrew-speaks-relationship-jeffrey-epstein-925849">gave an interview to the BBC</a>,</b> during which he denied any knowledge of Epstein's crimes.</p>
      <p>He also addressed pictures taken of the pair in New York two years after the American was jailed for two charges of procuring underage girls in Florida.</p>
