      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/brazil-football">Brazil</a> snapped a five-game winless streak with <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Philippe_Coutinho">Philippe Coutinho</a> starring in a 3-0 win over South Korea in Abu Dhabi.</p>
      <p>Lucas Paqueta brokes the deadlock when the AC Milan crouched low to head in Renan Lodi's delightful cross.</p>
      <p>Coutinho, who was recalled to the starting line-up after a couple of matches on the bench, then doubled the lead nine minutes brefore the break, bending a super free-kick over the wall and into the top left corner past a helpless Jo.</p>
      <p>​Danilo got his first international goal on the hour with a crisp strike from outside the box.</p>
      <p>The match extended South Korea’s poor run, with the Asian side now having gone three games without scoring.</p>
