      <p>It’s not uncommon for proud parents to sport tattoos bearing the names of their children.</p>
      <p>But soon loving <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/rutherglen">Rutherglen</a> mum-of -three Debbie Gormley will be adding a fourth name, Jacob – the name she helped her eldest child choose as he looks to a future when he can be free of his female body.</p>
      <p>Nineteen-year-old Jacob, who was born Lauren, had been in turmoil living in a female body when he finally shared his wish to be a boy at the age of 17.</p>
      <p>“I started researching it when I was 16 when I wasn’t quite sure if it was the right thing for me,” explained former Trinity High pupil Jacob, who stopped dressing in feminine clothes after wearing a bridesmaid’s dress at his auntie’s wedding four years ago.</p>
      <p>“I always go to my mum first.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t know what she was going to think. I had made it up to be that it would explode, she was going to hate me and I’d be thrown out, homeless.”</p>
      <p>But Debbie , whose oldest child was a tomboy who favoured go-karting and Lego to dolls and skipping, has a different recollection of the revelation.</p>
      <p>“Jacob said to me, ‘mum, I want to be a boy’, and I said, ‘right, okay’.</p>

      <p>“It must have been huge coming out and saying it. To me, it didn’t change anything. I thought, ‘ah, now I’ve got it. I see it now’.”</p>
      <p>Although it took two weeks for dad Matthew to process the information, it was he who stood alongside Jacob on the initial steps of his transgender journey by accompanying him to his first doctor’s appointment.</p>
      <p>“Dad phoned me as I was just about to leave the house,” explained Jacob.</p>
      <p>“He said, ‘do you want me to come and sit in the waiting room with you? You’ll be shaking like a leaf. You are my son, and you will always be my son’.”</p>
      <p>The certainty he’d made the right decision didn’t automatically make life run smoothly for Jacob.</p>
      <p>He doesn’t harbour a grudge against the older generation of college lecturers who inadvertently but frequently misgendered him.</p>

      <p>But the stress was too much and Jacob dropped out of his music studies. After telling his parents of his wish to change gender, Jacob was to share his decision with his beloved nana, while brother Calum, 13, and sister Emily, 11, took it all in their stride.</p>
      <p>It has been a tortuous two years since he joined the NHS waiting list for a sex realignment consultation.When the initial 12-month wait came and went, followed by further delays, it became more than Jacob could bear.</p>
      <p>“I was waiting at the door, checking the mail every day for my appointment letter,” said Jacob.</p>
      <p>“I’d be in tears every day it didn’t arrive. I struggled to go out and do anything. Every day it was terrible trying to accept I hadn’t got the letter again.”</p>
      <p>Unable to watch their child in turmoil, Debbie and Matthew suggested private treatment.</p>
      <p>Debbie said: “Going through the process of watching your child breaking all the time is horrific. He was in so much turmoil. It was heart wrenching.”</p>
      <p>Jacob will attend his third appointment at a private clinic in Edinburgh in three weeks and hopes to be taking male hormones ahead of his surgery should he raise enough cash through the gofundme page he’s set up with a target of £6500.</p>
      <p>“The hormones mean my voice is going to deepen and I won’t look as baby faced,” said Jacob, who ended up in A&amp;E with severe rib pain caused by the binder he wears to flatten his chest.</p>
      <p>Frequently misgendered, people mistake him for a 12-year-old boy.</p>

      <p>“I get ID’d for everything,” he said. “It is crazy.”</p>
      <p>The family hope their GP will be able to help keep costs down by administering Jacob’s hormone injections.</p>
      <p>And although his decision to have surgery is resolute, he knows he has a long journey ahead.</p>
      <p>Jacob said: “It is as scary as anything going in and having a long drawn-out operation and the healing process will take six months, but I would rather face it and go ahead with it to make myself feel better, more comfortable and less upset all the time, less angry.”</p>
      <p>With the love and support of his parents and the girlfriend he began dating a year ago, Jacob has the courage to share his story in the hope of promoting a better understanding of issues and challenges faced by the transgender community.</p>
      <p>He also receives tremendous support from his co-workers at McDonalds in Castlemilk.</p>
      <p>“Everyone in my work accepts me in a way I would never have expected,” said Jacob, who hopes to return to college when his hormone treatment starts.</p>
      <p>“If they see me upset, they know why – and they’ll not let me leave a shift until they see me smile.”</p>
      <p>A young man whose maturity defies his years, Jacob continued: “I just want the torment to be over and the happiness and positive outlook to last forever.”</p>

      <p>Mum Debbie is confident that Jacob will succeed in finding the life and career he wants and deserves.</p>
      <p>“I, and a lot of people who have known him most of his life, have said that at the age of 19, Jacob is so brave,” said Debbie, 44.</p>
      <p>“Since he has told us, there has been a massive change in him as a person.</p>
      <p>“The anxiety is still there because of the misgendering, but there is light at the end of the tunnel. He knows where he is going and he has answers. I just want him to be happy and healthy, that’s all.”</p>
      <p>Unlike some parents, Debbie has not seen the change in Jacob as the loss of a child.</p>
      <p>“This is still my child, the person I gave birth to,” she said.</p>
      <p>“The past is still there with Lauren, which is why I’ll keep that tattoo. But there’s nothing to stop me getting another with Jacob’s name. Because that is the future.”</p>
