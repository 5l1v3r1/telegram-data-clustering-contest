      <p>BELLEVUE -- If you're worried about the addition of thousands of giant, tall trees slated for Bellevue, don't forget that the city has 2,000 acres of undeveloped public forests for them to spread around.</p>
      <p>The city of Bellevue started a considerable tree planting effort this week. By the end of winter, it aims to have planted 1,000 giant sequoia trees and 5,000 native conifers.</p>
      <p>"Although native to areas in Northern California, sequoias have thrived throughout the Pacific Northwest region for decades," said Christina Faine with the city of Bellevue's Parks and Community Services.</p>
      <p>Volunteers with Cedar Crest Academy <a href="https://bellevuewa.gov/city-news/sequoia-planting">helped start the effort by planting 300 giant sequoia trees</a> throughout Bellevue's Wilburton Park on Nov. 16 -- though they are currently only 2-feet-tall. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequoiadendron_giganteum">Giant sequoias </a>can grow to be well over 200 feet tall, and more than 20 feet in diameter. But it takes time to get to that size -- they can live up to 3,000 years.</p>
      <p>Officials didn't just choose the sequoias for their impressive statistics. The city has experienced a shrinking tree canopy for decades, and has a goal of increasing coverage. Bellevue currently have about 1.4 million trees. While its tree canopy has held over the past decade, the city has experienced a decline in trees since the 1980s.</p>
      <p>A 2017 assessment concluded that the city has about 37% tree coverage. That's about 3% short of its goal. In recent years, environmental challenges have arisen, making that goal more difficult to reach.</p>
      <p>"Over the past five years, the Pacific Northwest has experienced some of the driest summers on record," Faine noted. "This has led to a greater degree of drought stress for native conifer trees, making them more vulnerable to fungal diseases, insects and other pathogens. As a result, we have seen a higher rate of decline and mortality in native conifers. Sequoia trees are more tolerant to drought stress and resist many of the pathogens that impact native conifers."</p>
      <p>Moving forward, city officials intend to plant approximately 7,000 new conifer trees within parks and other open spaces each year.</p>
      <p>"Approximately 57 percent of the tree canopy found within Bellevueâ€™s parks and open space system is made up of shorter-lived deciduous tree species such as big leaf maple and red alder," Faine said. "Planting and introducing longer-lived conifer species into these areas is an important step in ensuring the long term health of these public forests for future generations."</p>
      <p>The small sequoias were donated with the help of local resident Philip Steilstra, a retired Boeing employee, and the nonprofit PropagationNation. They're worth about $8,000.</p>
      <p>The remaining 700 sequoia trees will be planted over the winter. The 5,000 native conifers also expected over the season will include western hemlock, western red cedar, and Douglas fir.</p>
