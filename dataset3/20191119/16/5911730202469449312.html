      <h1>New formula will tell you how old your dog is in human years</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:31:15+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:31</time> by <a rel="author">WXYZ Staff</a></address>
      <p>We always thought we knew how to calculate our dog's age in human years. It's been widely believed that one dog year equals seven human years, <a href="https://www.wxyz.com/news/new-formula-will-tell-you-how-old-your-dog-is-in-human-years">but researchers say</a> they now have a new formula.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/math/a29830394/dog-years-human-years/">Popular Mechanics,</a> the researchers studied DNA mehtylation with the genomes of 104 Labrador retrievers between 4 weeks old and 16 years of age.</p>
      <p>The researchers found, according to the magazine, that for both humans and the Labrador retrievers, "areas with high rates of mutation – show similar rates of methylation."</p>
      <p>That means that life stages for a dog closely sync with life stages for humans. According to Popular Mechanics, an example is that babies and puppies start teething around equivalent ages.</p>
      <p>The formula for calculated the age of a dog is quite complicated.</p>
      <p>"To calculate the age, you’ll have to multiply the natural logarithm of your pup’s age by 16 and then add 31. Here’s the equation: <b>16 x ln(your dog’s age in human years) + 31," </b>the website said.</p>
      <p>Luckily for you, the researchers created a <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/11/here-s-better-way-convert-dog-years-human-years-scientists-say?">calculator</a> <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2019/11/here-s-better-way-convert-dog-years-human-years-scientists-say?">that you can use on the Science Magazine website</a> .</p>
      <p>The equivalent ages, according to the calculator, are below.</p>
      <p>1 dog year = 31 human years<br/>2 dog years = 42.1 human years<br/>3 dog years = 48.6 human years<br/>4 dog years = 53.2 human years<br/>5 dog years = 56.8 human years<br/>6 dog years = 59.7 human years<br/>7 dog years = 62.1 human years<br/>8 dog years = 64.3 human years<br/>9 dog years = 66.2 human years<br/>10 dog years = 67.8 human years<br/>11 dog years = 69.4 human years<br/>12 dog years = 70.8 human years<br/>13 dog years = 72 human years<br/>14 dog years = 73.2 human years<br/>15 dog years = 74.3 human years</p>
