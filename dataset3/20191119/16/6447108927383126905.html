      <p>Detroit: Become Human was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/03/21/detroit-become-human-beyond-two-souls-and-heavy-rain-are-coming-to-pc/">confirmed for PC</a> back in March along with Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls. In Detroit players take the roles of three androids and these are Kara, Connor, and Markus. All three have different situations to contend with and dilemmas to face as they navigate the attitudes of humanity towards them.  If you haven’t played Detroit: Become Human you can check out what Tuffcub thought of it when he played it for review.</p>
      <blockquote>Detroit: Become Human really is like sitting down and playing a TV box set. It’s a technical masterpiece on PS4 with movie quality sound, lighting and camera work, which is backed up by some top quality action and a wonderfully evocative score. Detroit really worked for me; I was gripped by the story and connected with the characters, but I think some players may have a hard time relating to Kara, Markus, and Connor. That’s to be expected. After all, we’re only human.</blockquote>
