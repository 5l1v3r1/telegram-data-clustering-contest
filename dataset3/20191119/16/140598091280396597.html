      <h1>The most romantic hotels in Berlin, from seductive interiors to cosy spas</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:40:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:40</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/p/paul-sullivan/" target="_blank">Paul Sullivan</a></address>
      <p>Beneath its hipster chic and urban cool, Berlin has a softer, more romantic side. Waterside promenades, parks and gardens provide pleasant strolling options, and there are many bars restaurants, cafés and terraces. Just as romantic are the hotels to hole up in too. Some are grander, offering opulence and refined service, while others have spas where massages and swish relaxation lounges are the setting. For something simpler, cosy rooms and apartments are just right for when a base is all you need, and may even come with featherbeds, heated floors, fluffy robes and free-standing bathtubs. Whatever you're looking for, here's our pick of the most romantic hotels in Berlin.</p>

      <p>This refined boutique bolthole is located in the edgier environs of eastern Kreuzberg. It offers excellent access to that district’s edgy bars, buzzy restaurants, such as Voo Store, and indie cultural spots like the Museum of Things. The 1913 hotel is set around the idea of culture and music – hence the grand Steinway piano, stage and a literary salon. There’s a couple of cosy fireplaces and a wooden bar serving coffee, wines and cocktails with a street view. Rooms have luxuries such as handmade mattresses, designer fabrics and funky couples' robes; larger rooms have extra lounge chairs and views onto Oranienplatz through generous bay windows. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/germany/berlin/hotels/orania-berlin-hotel//">Read expert review</a> From £ 144 per night <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/de/orania-berlin.html?aid=839822;label=TMG-1travel1destinations1europe1germany1berlin1articles1best0romantic0hotels0in0berlin-Orania.Berlin">Check availability</a> Rates provided by Booking.com</p>

      <p>With the Unesco-heritage Museum Island just 400 metres away, unobstructed views over the historic Berliner Dom from the corner suites, and the small but pretty Monbijou Park right across the street, the location of this hotel is rather unbeatable.

For colder months, there’s a well-stocked library and flickering fireplace in the lounge area. The vintage-style rooms are compact but cute, but the star of the show is the courtyard bar, which offers local wines and craft beers, plus cocktails made with boutique gins, whiskies and vodkas. <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/germany/berlin/hotels/monbijou-hotel//">Read expert review</a> From £ 65 per night <a href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/de/monbijou.html?aid=839822;label=TMG-1travel1destinations1europe1germany1berlin1articles1best0romantic0hotels0in0berlin-Monbijou2Hotel">Check availability</a> Rates provided by Booking.com</p>
