      <p>KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia's Minister of Home Affairs Muhyiddin Yassin on Tuesday (Nov 19) called for drastic changes within the Pakatan Harapan (PH) government, after the ruling coalition suffered a <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/barisan-nasional-wee-jeck-seng-wins-tanjung-piai-byelection-12100108">humbling defeat in the Tanjung Piai by-election</a> at the weekend. </p>
      <p>Changes must be made "immediately" and without delay if the party wants to remain in power for more than one term, he said.</p>
