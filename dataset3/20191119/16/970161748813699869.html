      <h1>Tom Felton declares it’s time for Hollywood to ‘bow down to the women'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:45:10+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://metro.co.uk/author/mel-evans/" target="_blank">Mel Evans</a></address>
      <p>Tom Felton has heartily declared it’s high time Hollywood ‘bowed down to the women’ and we can’t help but shout out ‘hear hear!’</p>
      <p>Go on, try it – it’s fabulous.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/harry-potter/">Harry Potter</a> star is taking on Shakespeare in latest film Ophelia alongside Daisy Ridley and in all its awesomeness Tom admits he was drawn to the project due to its championing of women.</p>
      <p>‘It’s time for men to bow down to the women with the power and skill and ability to make these stories,’ the 32-year-old star tells<b> Metro.co.uk</b>, on the promo trail as the character of Laertes, brother of Daisy’s Ophelia.</p>
      <p>To the actor, not only is the Shakespeare classic, based on the tale of Hamlet, ‘timeless’ to the Brit thespian, but by taking it in a different direction and focusing on the female protagonists – also including Naomi Watts as Queen Gertrude – you’re unlocking an untapped resource of the movie business.</p>

      <p>‘This is the day and age for that really [and] you’ve also got one of the strongest female actors in the business as the lead,’ Tom continues.</p>

      <p>‘Claire [McCarthy] the director is ferociously talented and lovely and strong and this is the time, isn’t it?</p>
      <p>‘Hearing her vision for it, I though, “hell yeah!” This is the time to be part of something like this. It was quite a no brainer on my part.’</p>
      <p>Starring alongside Star Wars’ Daisy right as she filmed the final instalment of the Skywalker trilogy, The Rise Of Skywalker, what off-set antics does the guy have? We need the tea, Malfoy!</p>
      <p>‘How much money do you have?’ Tom cheekily profers.</p>

      <p>‘You get this thing in your head that big stars might not be normal people, but they’re incredibly normal,’ Tom, Hollywood megastar, says.</p>
      <p>‘I worked with Clive [Owen] when I was eight-years-old in my first TV job. He remembered me [on this set], which was a surprise.</p>
      <p>‘We went out a few nights. You’re learning and admiring their work and working alongside them, but I think you learn just as much from people when you see them off the set than on.’</p>
      <p>But…but Tom, were you able to glean any Star Wars spoilers from your co-star?</p>

      <p>‘No, if I did I would be too drunk to remember them,’ he laughs.</p>

      <p>‘We traded war stories of what it’s like to be on set and in the fandom.’</p>
      <p>In fact, when Tom first met Daisy, he thought she didn’t like him (a Harry fan over Draco, perhaps?)</p>
      <p>‘[I said] “You were quite quiet!” and somewhere in the midst, I think she put it in an interview she was a big Harry Potter fan and freaking out Draco Malfoy was her brother,’ he says.</p>
      <p>‘Everyone has grown up with those films in one way or another and I’m a massive fan of her work as well.’</p>
