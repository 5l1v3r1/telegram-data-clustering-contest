      <p>Did <b>Brad Pitt</b> really surprise <b>Jennifer Aniston</b> with flowers backstage at the People’s Choice Awards earlier this month? That’s what one of the tabloids is claiming. <b>Gossip Cop</b> can confirm it didn’t happen.</p>
      <p>Aniston received the People’s Icon Award at the 2019 People’s Choice Awards, where she was honored for her career achievements over the years. According to <i><b>Woman’s Day</b></i>, “the real action” took place behind the scenes of the ceremony when Pitt made a surprise appearance “clutching a huge bouquet of white roses, tulips and lotus flowers, which someone later pointed out was a replica of her wedding bouquet.”</p>
      <p>An alleged insider tells the magazine, “Brad was ushered into her dressing room and Jen was more shocked than anyone that he’d come to support her. Her eyes welled up with tears. It clearly meant a huge amount to her.” From there, the supposed source says that ever since his 2016 split from Angelina Jolie, Pitt has been taking steps to rekindle a romance with Aniston.</p>
      <p>The questionable tipster further contends that part of Pitt’s plan also involves winning over those in her inner circle. The outlet points to the actor’s recent chat with Adam Sandler for <i>Variety</i>’s Actors on Actors series. The “source” says Pitt has struck up a “bromance” with Sandler, who’s close with Aniston, which “is a clear sign that Jen’s pals are welcoming him back into their clique.” In reality, Pitt and Sandler have been friendly for years and the two even made note of that in their joint one-on-one interview. But that’s the least of the problems with the outlet’s fabricated article.</p>
      <p>The premise is based on claims from an unidentified “insider,” but <b>Gossip Cop</b> reached out to Aniston’s spokesperson, who tells us on the record that the story is “false.” The actress’s rep, who attended the People’s Choice Awards with her, tells us in no uncertain terms that Pitt “was not there.”</p>
      <p>Additionally, it’s bizarre for <i>Woman’s Day</i> to claim that Pitt is only now trying to reconcile with his ex-wife. This is the same outlet that <b>Gossip Cop</b> busted last year for falsely claiming <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/jennifer-aniston-brad-pitt-married-secret-wedding-ring/">Pitt and Aniston had secretly gotten married again</a>. Three months before that nonsense, the tabloid swore <a href="https://www.gossipcop.com/jennifer-aniston-pregnant-brad-pitt-baby/">Aniston was pregnant with Pitt’s baby</a>. Neither of those phony scenarios are mentioned in this latest piece about a surprise visit at the People’s Choice Awards. That’s because the outlet seems to come up with its fake storylines on a whim.</p>
