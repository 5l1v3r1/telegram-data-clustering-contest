      <p>Outbreak of a mysterious fever at Thisaiyanvilai has triggered panic among the public especially after the death of Monisha, 4, of Selvamarudhur.</p>
      <p>As the girl suffered from fever, her father Chandrasekar took her to a private hospital and then to the primary health centre at Thisaiyanvilai from where she was referred to the Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital where she died on Monday.</p>
      <p>Neither doctors nor officials attached to the Department of Public Health are prepared disclose the reason for her death. But people say that she died of vector-borne disease. Accusing doctors of the PHC of failing to diagnose the type of fever at the right time and start the right treatment, relatives of the deceased laid siege to the hospital on Monday. As the protest continued ever after the dusk, the police and health department officials pacified them.</p>
      <p>The death of Monisha has spread panic among residents who urge officials to take appropriate preventive measures especially anti-dengue operations at Thisaiyanvilai and nearby villages.</p>
      <p>“More than 25 persons including six boys from Thisaiyanvilai have been admitted to various hospitals including Tirunelveli Medical College Hospital with fever. The sudden rise in prevalence of fever triggers panic among the public. The officials should take suitable measures in our area to check incidence of fever,” said a man, whose two sons are undergoing treatment in a private hospital at Thisaiyanvilai.</p>
