          <b>However, you can upgrade feedback to neutral or positive if you wish.</b>

      <p>When you’ve purchased something on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/ebay">eBay</a>, it’s always helpful to the seller when you leave positive feedback to let other users know that the seller is reliable, timely, and accurately describes their products.</p>
      <p>Likewise, it can also be a way to warn others of a fraudulent seller if they don’t send the item you bought or you receive something broken, faulty, or completely different than what was described.</p>
      <p>That being said, you may want to change feedback you’ve left on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/ebay">eBay</a> if you realize you’ve made an error in your comment or you’ve since had an issue (or resolved one) with the seller in question.</p>
      <p>While <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/ebay">eBay</a> doesn’t allow you to change feedback once it’s been left, you can leave a follow-up comment with additional information.</p>
      <p>Here’s how to do it.</p>
      <h3>How to change feedback on <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/category/ebay">eBay</a> by following up</h3>
      <p><b>1.</b> Log into your account on the eBay website using your username and password.</p>
      <p><b>2.</b> Visit the <a href="https://pages.ebay.com/services/forum/feedback.html">eBay Feedback Forum</a> directly. Alternatively, you can access this via the My eBay “Leave feedback” shortcut.</p>
      <p><b>3.</b> On the right-hand side of the eBay Feedback Forum, click the “Follow up to feedback left” link.</p>

      <p>Note that you can also change ratings from neutral or negative to positive if you ask the seller to send you a revision request. Once you receive the request, you only need to accept it and change the rating to your new preferred choice, then save the changes.</p>
