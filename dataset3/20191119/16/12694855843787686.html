        <b> The popular TV show Rick and Morty has picked its side in the ongoing Intel vs AMD CPU race, and it seems our favourite fictional scientist is all about Threadripper.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In the show, titular character Rick Sanchez has been spotted using an AMD QX3700+. The CPU doesn’t actually exist in the real world (as far as we know) and fans have speculated the “Q” could indicate it’s a quantum computing chip.</p>

      <p>We learned of Rick’s preference for AMD in the new episode called <i>The Outdated Gentleman and the Seat</i>. Rick uses the computer to carry out “reverse digestion extrapolation” – clearly highly important work.</p>
      <p>As Rick is casting an eye over the computer screens, we get a glimpse of the specs of the AMD QX3700+ (You can take a look yourself <a href="https://external-preview.redd.it/gZJnF8uBFF2cy-LgHRk0ZR86e3iVKtWMQdZJbatwhXo.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=0264d2b6b3589d085edfdabc639f27b1a144570f">here</a>):</p>
      <ul>
        <li>128-bit</li>
        <li>Around 400TB of SSD storage</li>
        <li>Around 3.5 billion GB of RAM</li>
        <li>Linux distribution created by Debian</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Users over on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/dy2uhc/rick_sanchez_rick_and_morty_runs_amd_cpus/">Reddit</a> have been keen to point out that the specs of Rick’s computer are a bit awry.</p>
      <p>Redditor Cakiery said: “Specifically he using Debian with a very old Linux kernel. 3.2.0 is from 2012. Which would mean he is probably using Debian 7 which went end of life in 2016. My point is, Rick reallly needs to install some updates … Also his partitions are real weird.”</p>
      <p>Fellow user Anticept followed up with: “I mean, these are pretty minor issues compared to the rest. Like running on a processor that is 7.9hz. Or using old style phosphor screens. There’s such a mix of old and new age stuff, it’s hilarious.”</p>

      <p>While we don’t give as a definitive answer as Rick, you can check out our thoughts on the Intel vs AMD issue in <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/surface-laptop-3-15-amd-vs-intel-3954001">our comparison of the two models of Surface Laptop 3 15</a>.</p>
      <p>Our full <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/surface-laptop-3-15">Surface Laptop 3 15 review</a> said: “The Surface Laptop 3 15 is a 15-inch premium laptop you can’t ignore; it’s remarkably built and an attractive bit of kit. </p>
      <p>The AMD Ryzen processor options tackle everyday tasks with ease, but this isn’t a device for high-end design work or gaming, while the battery performance is a major let down.”</p>
