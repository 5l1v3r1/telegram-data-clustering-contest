      <p>Former <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/england-football-0">England</a> manager <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/FabioCapello">Fabio Capello</a> believes <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/FrankLampard">Frank Lampard</a> has the perfect “understanding” to succeed as Three Lions coach in the future.</p>
      <p>Lampard worked under Capello at the 2010 World Cup, as well as during two qualifying campaigns, and the Italian has been impressed by the Chelsea manager's start to the season.</p>
      <p>The Blues currently sit in third place in the Premier League while Lampard has overhauled the morale of the squad by bringing through a wave of academy graduates. </p>
      <p>Asked if he thought Lampard was suited to the role, Capello told <i>Sky Sports</i>: ”I don’t know. Probably ... because he can do it. He understands everything and has started without fear and put young players on the pitch.”</p>
      <p>Capello singled out Lampard’s ability to turn around the club’s fortunes, after beginning his tenure with just two wins in eight games, as the focus of his admiration.</p>
      <p>“I follow him. I watch all the games and I was upset when he started the season and he lost two games and the team didn’t play well.</p>
      <p>“Now, the results are good and the position is really good and without the [transfer] market.”</p>
