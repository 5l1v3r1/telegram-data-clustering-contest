      <p>Actor James Moore, who plays Ryan Stocks in <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/">Emmerdale</a>, was pulled over for drink driving after an onlooker mistook his ataxic cerebral palsy for being drunk.</p>
      <p>In a series of tweets, Ryan explained that the charity Ataxia UK are running a campaign called 'disordered not drunk' where disabled people recount their stories of mistakenly being labelled drunk and went on to say he very recently had it happen to him.</p>

      <p>James said that he went for a meal with his girlfriend Sophie, but unbeknownst to him, an onlooker called the police.</p>
      <p>He was later pulled over and told a concerned citizen rang claiming he was driving under influence.</p>
      <p>James went on to say that he took a breathalyser which proved he was sober.</p>

      <p>The Emmerdale star then said there needs to be more awareness as disability can affect balance and motor skills.</p>
      <p>He also encouraged his followers just to ask if they see someone who appears drunk.</p>
      <p>He ended his series of tweets by saying the police were "fantastic" and let him go very quickly.</p>
      <p>Ataxic cerebral palsy is a developmental disorder that affects motor function and can cause problems with balance and coordination.</p>

      <p>James is the first actor with ataxic cerebral palsy to be a permanent cast member in Emmerdale.</p>
      <p>He joined the cast last year as <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/a-short-history-of-emmerdales-charity-dingle/">Charity Dingle's</a> long-lost son and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/james-moore-pays-sweet-tribute-to-emmerdale-fans-after-ntas-win/">earlier this year won the National Television Award for Best Newcomer</a>.</p>
      <p>Recently, his character has been helping Kim Tate and Al Chapman improve the disabled facilities at the new outdoors centre.</p>
      <p>Last week, disabled Coronation Street actress <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/coronation-street/coronation-streets-cherylee-houston-in-tears-over-hotels-accessibility/">Cherylee Houston revealed she was left in tears of frustration</a> after a hotel asked if she'd mind being carried to her 'accessible' room as it had two steps.</p>
      <p>She has since started a hashtag #takingthedis for people to share their stories of inaccessibility.</p>
