        <b>The FBI is now treating Jeffrey Epstein’s death as a criminal matter, according to<br/>Bureau of Prisons Director Kathleen Hawk Sawyer.</b>
      </p>
      <p>During a Judiciary Committee hearing on Tuesday, Sawyer said the FBI is probing the possibility of a “criminal enterprise” involved in Epstein’s death.</p>
      <p>Sawyer was responding to a question from Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) who asked if the FBI was probing both the possibilities of a “major malfunction” and a “criminal enterprise” that attributed to Epstein’s death.</p>

      <p>“The FBI is involved [in both possibilities] and they are looking into a criminal enterprise,” Sawyer responded.</p>
      <p>Despite popular opinion that Epstein was murdered, it’s likely that federal investigators will first pivot to a belief that a “criminal enterprise” helped Epstein commit suicide.</p>
      <p>Although, given the extreme irregularities surrounding his death – and the fact that prominent forensic expert Michael Baden <a href="https://www.zerohedge.com/political/jeffrey-epstein-was-strangulated-famous-forensic-expert-says">believes</a> Epstein was “strangulated” – the case could still break open into a murder investigation.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The fact that the FBI is now looking for signs of “criminal enterprise” – instead of just simply sweeping the matter under the rug – is unprecedented.</p>
