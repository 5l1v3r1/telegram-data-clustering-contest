      <p>Fans of fast <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/food/">food</a> chain McDonald's can get their hands on a free portion of fries this week.</p>
      <p>To take advantage of the offer, all customers have to do is download the My McDonald's app, which is available for free on iOs and Android devices.</p>
      <p>This Friday (22.11.19), anyone with the app - including those who already have it downloaded on their handsets - can pick up a portion of Medium Fries from selected restaurants for nothing.</p>

      </p>
      <p>No purchase is necessary, either. Customers just have to place an order for the fries via the app and then pick them up.</p>
      <p>As reported by the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/mcdonalds-chips-free-friday-one-20915349">Mirror</a>, new customers will have to go into a restaurant since it's their first order, but those who already have the app can do click and collect or pick up from the Drive Thru.</p>
      <p>Existing customers also have the option of having their order brought directly to their table under McDonald's new Table Markers scheme, introduced from this week.</p>
      <p>It's not the only giveaway McDonald's has treated fans to in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>The fast food giant is <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/food/mcdonalds-is-giving-away-2000-free-christmas-jumpers-heres-how-you-can-get-one/">looking to hand out 2,000 Christmas jumpers</a> in a bid to get its customers #ReindeerReady this festive season.</p>
      <p>The dark green jumper takes its inspiration from the new McDonald's Christmas ad, which features a cute reindeer called Archie.</p>
