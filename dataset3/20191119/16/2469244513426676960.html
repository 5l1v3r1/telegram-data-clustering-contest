      <h1>The most dangerous countries to visit in 2020</h1>
      <h2>Countries such as Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria are among the most dangerous</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T16:32:55+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 16:32</time> by <a rel="author">Zara Whelan, Jamie Hawkins</a></address>
      <p>The most dangerous places to visit next year have been revealed on an interactive map.</p>
      <p>The map lists which countries have the highest security risks in the world, including Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria.</p>
      <p>Countries including Sierra Leone, Liberia, Niger along with North Korea, Venezuela and Haiti all score "very high" when it comes to health risk - including infectious diseases, according to the latest Travel Risk Map.</p>
      <p>The map, created by security and risk experts <a href="https://www.internationalsos.com/risk-outlook">International SOS</a>, ranks the safety of countries across the globe in terms of medical, security and road risks.</p>
      <p>For the first two categories, countries are given a rating out of five, while road safety is rated out of four based on the mortality rate per 100,000 people.</p>
      <p>Those visiting Europe, the USA, Japan, South Korea, Canada, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand all have the lowest chance of catching a disease while travelling.</p>

      <p>When it comes to security threat to travellers is negligible in places such as Norway, Iceland, Switzerland, Slovenia, Greenland and Finland.</p>
      <p>Travel security risk levels are considered low (rather than insignificant) in the UK and Ireland - on par with the rest of Europe, the US and Canada, China, Australia and New Zealand.</p>
      <p>Some of the world’s most dangerous roads are in Vietnam, Venezuela, Belize, Saudi Arabia, the Dominican Republic, South Africa and Thailand.</p>
      <p>However UK roads are considered safe by comparison, along with most of Europe, New Zealand, Australia and Japan being ranked as low risk.</p>
      <p>nternational SOS MD Doug Quarry said: "The threats facing organisations and their workforces are impacting established and emerging economies alike.</p>
      <p>"It’s encouraging to see that decision makers are becoming increasingly aware of the threats of epidemics and infectious diseases.</p>

      <p>"With accurate information, tools and support in place, organisations should, and can, plan for the anticipated risks and safeguard their investment and their people."</p>
      <p>Travel Risk Map is an annual rating review of the prevalent travel medical and security risks across the world in terms of Risk Ratings. All risk ratings shown are taken in November 2019.</p>
