      <p>WASHINGTON: E-commerce giant Amazon is doing “extremely well” in India, its founder and CEO <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Jeff-Bezos">Jeff Bezos</a> said while expressing hope for regulatory stability in the country. Bezos’ remarks came in response to a question on Amazon’s concerns over some Indian policies with regard to digitisation.</p>
      <p>“Regulatory stability is the thing that we would always hope for India. Whatever the regulations are... they are stable in time and that’s one of the things we’re hoping will now be true. We’ll see,” Bezos said on Sunday. “Our business in India is growing very rapidly,” Bezos said.</p>
      <p>He added that the head of Amazon’s India operations Amit Agarwal, with whom he has worked for 20 years, is performing really well.</p>
      <p>The US-based e-tailer is pumping in over Rs 4,400 crore (more than $600 million) in its various units in India including marketplace and food retail to compete against Walmart-owned arch-rival Flipkart. Amazon had registered cumulative losses of over Rs 7,000 crore across various units in 2018-19.</p>
      <p>Bezos had committed investment worth $5 billion in the Indian market in 2016. On Friday, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Microsoft">Microsoft</a> co-founder <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Bill-Gates">Bill Gates</a>, with a net worth of $110 billion, replaced Bezos as the world’s richest person.</p>
      <p>Amazon and rival Flipkart have been pumping in millions of dollars across various operations like marketplace, infrastructure and supply chain management as well as marketing and promotion as they look to strengthen their position in the country’s ecommerce market.</p>
