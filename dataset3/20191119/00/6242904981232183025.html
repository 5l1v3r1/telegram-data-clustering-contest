        <b>Spanish side Real Zaragoza have signed Espanyol forward Javi Puado as replacement for Ghana forward Raphael Dwamena. </b>
      </p>
      <p>The 21-year moves to Zaragoza on loan for the rest of the season after Raphael Dwamena was diagnosed of a heart problem.</p>
      <p>Dwamena is still awaiting the full results of his heart tests, before proceeding to make a decision about his future in the sport.</p>
      <p>Even though medics have advised him to stop playing.</p>
      <p>Real Zaragoza are expected to complete the process of parting ways with the Ghanaian in the coming days.</p>
      <p>However coach Victor Fernandez confirmed the arrival of the striker after their 1-0 defeat to Albecete, insisting they can't rely on only forward Luis Suarez.</p>
      <p>“Today is an example of why that player comes. It has speed, it has verticality and goal. We cannot depend solely and exclusively on Luis Suarez,” says Victor Fernandez. </p>
      <p>"I think today's game is the answer to why we have looked for a midfield player upwards," he added. </p>
