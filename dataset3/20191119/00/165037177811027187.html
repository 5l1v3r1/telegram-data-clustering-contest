        <b>Robert Moreno, the ex-Spain coach, did not want to give a press conference prior to the game against Romania and did not attend the meeting this Tuesday with Rubiales. When will he give his version of events?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>The last few hours have been especially hectic</b> for the Spanish national team. Before the game against Romania, news broke of <b>Luis Enrique becoming the Spain manager</b> once again. </p>
      <p>The decision does not seem to have gone down well with Robert Moreno, <b>who did not want to speak to the media</b> and he cancelled his press conference after the comprehensive Spain victory and fantastic qualification campaign.</p>
      <p>As 'Marca' reported, <b>the coach said goodbye to the players</b> in the dressing room and Rubiales called the media for a press conference <b>this Tuesday at 12.30 in the Federation HQ in Las Rozas, Madrid.</b> In the press conference, the RFEF president announced the return of Luis Enrique. </p>
      <p>Beforehand, he had a meeting with Robert Moreno and Francisco Molina,<b> but the now ex-coach did not attend it</b> and the two lawyers have respected his decision not to turn up. </p>
