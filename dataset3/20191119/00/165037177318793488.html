        <b>Gibraltar Under-19s may have had the worst week in football, as a 16-1 loss to Switzerland took their tally of goals conceded to 43.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Gibraltar Under-19s suffered a 16-1 defeat to 10-man Switzerland</b> in qualifying for the European Under-19 Championship on Tuesday, rounding off a week in which<b> they have conceded 43 goals.</b></p>
      <p>Following on from a 14-0 loss to Austria and a 13-0 defeat at the hands of Ireland on November 14 and 16 respectively<b>, Gibraltar will have been hoping for a change in fortune</b> in the meeting with the Swiss. But the youngsters suffered more of the same as Switzerland raced into a 5-0 lead by the 33rd minute - Brighton and Hove Albion's<b> Lorent Tolaj helping himself to a hat-trick</b> - in Strasswalchen, Austria.</p>

      <p><b>A red card for Switzerland's Noel Wetz </b>enabled Craig Galliano to convert the resulting penalty and give Gibraltar one thing to be pleased about, considering<b> it was their first goal in 11 games</b>, ending a run which stretched back to 2015. Yet any hopes Galliano's goal would spark a miracle comeback were ended within a minute as Tolaj got his fourth before Felix Mambimbi's penalty<b> paved the way for a further 11 Switzerland goals </b>in the second half.</p>
      <p><b>Tolaj scored three to take his total to seven</b>, substitute Darian Males claimed a hat-trick and Orges Bunjaku also netted his third goal, with Ilan Sauter and Simon Sohm getting in on the act as <b>Switzerland scored six goals in the final 13 minutes</b>.</p>
