      <p><b>inside the <a href="https://www.designboom.com/tag/david-rockwell-group/">rockwell group</a>-designed <i>moxy east village</i> hotel, italian artist <a href="https://www.designboom.com/tag/edoardo-tresoldi/">edoardo tresoldi</a> has installed an ethereal sculpture that floats above the main dining room at <i>cathédrale</i> — the hotel’s landmark french-mediterranean restaurant.</b> infilling the triple height domed ceiling is tresoldi’s signature wire mesh piece called ‘fillmore’, which pays homage to new york’s legendary <i>fillmore east</i>, a venue widely revered for its medieval revival architecture. the 19-foot installation evokes the grandeur of the past, and creates a dramatic dialogue with the restaurant’s architecture and interior design.</p>

      <p><b>the design of <a href="http://moxy-hotels.marriott.com/nyc/east-village/">moxy east village</a> has been conceived by <a href="https://www.rockwellgroup.com/">rockwell group</a> as a non-linear timeline, with each floor revealing a layer of inspiration drawn from different eras in the east village’s storied history</b>. <i>cathédrale</i>, located one level below ground, evokes the musical legacy of the 1960s. guests descend from the hotel lobby via a staircase that resembles a fire escape between buildings. the main dining room is characterized by a soaring, triple-height space covered by <a href="https://www.edoardotresoldi.com/"><b>tresoldi’s</b> </a>delicate yet monumental sculpture that appears as an apparition of a grand domed ceiling.</p>
      <p><b><i>cathédrale</i> also includes an open kitchen with copper accents and a bar area with distressed plaster walls and neon signs that reference east village hotspots.</b> ‘the poster room’ — a private dining area — immerses diners in the psychedelic rock era with its walls and ceiling lined with backlit screen prints of vintage concert posters. </p>

      <p><b>while tresoldi, who was <a href="https://www.designboom.com/design/the-design-prize-2019-nominations-03-18-2019/">nominated for THE DESIGN PRIZE 2019</a>, is best known for creating temporary interventions in public spaces, ‘fillmore’ is permanently installed at moxy east village.</b> the artist refers to the sculpture as an <i>‘architectural precious wreck,’</i> and<i> ‘a tribute to the legendary cultural background that influenced not only new york’s culture, but several generations worldwide.’</i> the hotel’s pièce de résistance, ‘fillmore’ marks <i>cathédrale</i> as an east village destination for art lovers, foodies, and architecture buffs alike.</p>
