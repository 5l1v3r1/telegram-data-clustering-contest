      <p>While <a href="http://mentalfloss.com/">MentalFloss.com</a> is still our primary brand, in 2019 we were given the opportunity to go back to our print roots and create a brand-new special edition of the print magazine (which you can purchase at Whole Foods, Barnes &amp; Noble, and on B&amp;N’s <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/mental-floss-2019-special-print-issue/34041432?ean=9781616884130">website</a>). The issue has sold amazingly well, and we attribute part of that to our very loyal readership—which is something that gave us a leg up when it came to reintroducing our print magazine to the marketplace.</p>
      <p>As for the biggest challenges of creating a print magazine, I’d say there are three big ones: cost, competition, and consumption.</p>
      <p><b>Cost</b> is the most obvious one: Printing a magazine costs money, and those costs go beyond the actual physical printing of the publication itself. There’s the cost of staffing a print magazine, which requires art directors and/or designers, plus writers. Art is another cost: We hire illustrators and photographers to create original art, and we license existing art for stories where we might need historical or other existing images. For this special edition, we worked with two separate fact-checkers as well as a copyeditor. Then there’s the printing of the magazine itself, and if you’re a regular print magazine with subscribers, the cost of postage is one major expense that few people think about.</p>
      <p><b>Competition</b>, of course, is always going to be a challenge—whether you’re in publishing or any other business. The key here is creating a product that clearly stands above the “competition,” while becoming unique enough that you almost have no direct “competition.” But whereas 10 to 20 years ago, a print magazine’s main competition came from other print magazines, now it comes from the web, too. Which means that anyone who is creating content is competing with millions of other places that produce content, so you need to make sure that it’s compelling and unique.</p>
      <p><b>Consumption</b> is a digital era challenge: Millennials and younger generations have grown up in a largely digital-only era, meaning that consuming their content via digital devices is what they know and are most comfortable with. So if you want to attract these readers to a print magazine, you have the added challenge of selling them on the power and benefit of print. (In case you’re wondering: Several scientific studies have shown that print can be great for your brain and your health.)</p>
      <p>One other challenge I want to mention, which I know my print editors out there will understand: <b>Cutting text to fit</b>! Fitting copy within a certain space isn’t something you have to think about when you work on the internet. Once we were looking at layouts for the magazine, we realized that many of our stories were way too long, which meant we spent hours cutting that text to fit. When I worked in print, I loved cutting fit; it’s one of those tedious tasks that appeals to me because it’s almost a puzzle to be solved—how can I express what we’re trying to say in a sentence instead of two paragraphs? It is torture when you’re doing it, but when that piece finally fits, you feel like you could take on the world.<i> </i></p>
