      <p>HONOLULU (AP) - A group of more than 50 nurses have carried picket signs near a Hawaii hospital to protest contract issues.</p>
      <p>The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported the nurses picketed outside Straub Medical Center in Honolulu Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The nurses have been working without a contract since Nov. 1.</p>
      <p>The Hawaii Nurses Association representing 450 registered nurses at Straub have been picketing since Saturday.</p>
      <p>Association President Daniel Ross says the nurses plan to continue picketing Wednesday to draw attention to what they consider a strict and punitive attendance policy.</p>

      <p>Straub CEO Art Gladstone says parent company Hawaii Pacific Health has an equitable attendance policy.</p>
      <p>Gladstone says the hospital has been negotiating with the association and offered a settlement providing wages and benefits consistent with other union contracts.</p>
      <p>Negotiations are scheduled to resume Wednesday.</p>
