        <b>Serge Gnabry hit a hat-trick as Germany finished top of their Euro 2020 qualifying group after brushing Northern Ireland aside 6-1 on Tuesday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Having already booked their berth at the Euro 2020 finals on Saturday by beating Belarus, the emphatic win in Frankfurt means <b>Germany finish their qualifying campaign top of Group C </b>ahead of the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>The Dutch also qualified last weekend.<b> Northern Ireland finish third</b> and will go into the play-offs for the Euro 2020 finals. <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/s-gnabry-159815/">Gnabry</a> reached 13 goals in as many internationals as the Northern Irish were given a masterclass in finishing. Another Bayern Munich player <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/l-goretzka-140287/">Leon Goretzka</a> also finished with two goals before Dortmund winger Julian Brandt grabbed Germany's sixth goal late on.</p>
      <p><b>This was Gnabry's second hat-trick for Germany</b>. He also scored three goals on his 2016 debut in an 8-0 mauling of minnows San Marino. <b>Gnabry also hit four goals in Bayern's 7-2 romp at Tottenham</b> in the Champions League last month.</p>

      <p><b>Northern Ireland took a shock lead</b> when a poor clearance header by Toni Kroos fell to <b>Michael Smith who drilled home his shot </b>from outside the area after only seven minutes. The Germans quickly recovered and Manchester City midfielder Ilkay Gundogan hit the post just before Gnabry claimed his first goal. He took a touch on the edge of the area before spinning and firing past Irish goalkeeper Bailey Peacock-Farrell on 19 minutes. <b>The Germans went into the break 2-1 up</b> after Goretzka poked the ball over the line via the upright on 42 minutes.</p>
      <p>Germany maintained their impressive pace and Gnabry grabbed his second just 66 seconds after half-time.<b> The former Arsenal winger slipped his marker </b>and fired home after a good cross from wing-back Lukas Klostermann. The Germans were cruising and Gnabry claimed his hat-trick on the hour by holding off Irish centre-back Tom Flanagan <b>before coolly slotting the ball home from a tricky angle.</b></p>
      <p>Not to be out-done,<b> Goretzka notched his second </b>as yet another Germany move left the Irish defence clutching at straws. Northern Irish midfielder Paddy McNair intercepted a ball from Kroos,<b> </b>but knocked it only as far as <b>Goretzka</b> <b>who picked his spot in the back of the net</b> on 73 minutes.</p>
      <p>With time almost up, <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/j-brandt-205928/">Brandt</a> <b>completed the rout </b>by finishing off a Kroos pass with the Northern Irish defence again exposed to delight home fans.</p>
