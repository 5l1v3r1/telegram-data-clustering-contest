      <h1>Astronomers: SpaceX’s Satellites Are Blocking View of Stars</h1>

      <h3>In Shock</h3>
      <p>Elon Musk’s spacetech company SpaceX is trying to bring broadband to the globe by sending up to 12,000 tiny satellites into low-Earth orbit. But not everybody is thrilled.</p>
      <p>Astronomers are finding that the 122 satellites SpaceX has launched so far are already ruining the night sky, showing up as extremely bright trails of light in observations.</p>
      <p>“Wow!! I am in shock!!,” <a href="https://twitter.com/89Marvaz/status/1196356715270291456">tweeted</a> Clarae Martínez-Vázquez, an astronomer at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in northern Chile. “The huge amount of Starlink satellites crossed our skies tonight at @cerrotololo. Our [Dark Energy Camera] exposure was heavily affected by 19 of them!”</p>
      <h3>Crowded Skies</h3>
      <p>The space company <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/watch-spacex-launch-60-starlink-satellites">sent</a> 60 new Starlink micro-satellites into low-Earth orbit on November 11, and many more launches are planned. Last year, the Federal Communications Commission <a href="https://futurism.com/spacex-satellites-approval-fcc">approved SpaceX’s request</a> to launch an additional 7,518 satellites, bringing up the total of approved units up to almost 12,000.</p>
      <p>That means that if SpaceX sticks to its plan, the issue is only going to get worse.</p>
      <p>“The train of Starlink satellites lasted for over 5 minutes!! Rather depressing… This is not cool!” <a href="https://twitter.com/89Marvaz/status/1196356715270291456">added</a> Martínez-Vázquez.</p>
      <h3>Radio Interference</h3>
      <p>The International Astronomical Union highlighted the issue in a <a href="https://www.iau.org/news/announcements/detail/ann19035/">June statement</a>, arguing that the reflective Starlink satellites could “be detrimental to the sensitive capabilities of large ground-based astronomical telescopes” and that “aggregate radio signals emitted from the satellite constellations can still threaten astronomical observations at radio wavelengths.”</p>
      <p>Some astronomers are even turning the problem into a meme.</p>
