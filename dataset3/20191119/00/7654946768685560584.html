      <h1>Legalize it? Joe Biden tries to clear air on marijuana stance</h1>

      <p>Presidential hopeful Joe Biden tried to clarify his position on the legalization of marijuana Monday — after he was <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/470861-biden-says-he-wont-legalize-marijuana-because-it-may-be-a-gateway-drug">quoted calling weed</a> a “gateway drug.”</p>
      <p>The Democratic candidate tweeted out what he called “the facts” of his position on whether to legalize the drug, which a number of states have done in both medical and recreational forms.</p>
      <p>“There is a lot of talk out there on where I stand when it comes to our marijuana laws,” <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1196577576644415489/photo/1">he wrote</a>. “Here are the facts.”</p>
      <p>Among Biden’s policy proposals were that recreational use of marijuana should be “decriminalized” and all prior convictions related to the act should be “expunged.”</p>
      <p>“No one should be in jail for marijuana use,” Biden’s tweet read.</p>
      <p>But while Biden wants to legalize medical marijuana, he stopped short of proposing a change to laws on the federal level.</p>
      <p>“Allow states to legalize recreational marijuana,” he said. “Reschedule marijuana so researchers can study its health impacts.”</p>
      <p>While speaking at a town hall in Las Vegas on Saturday, Biden said there was “not nearly been enough evidence” to determine whether marijuana is used to introduce people to other drugs such as heroin and opioids.</p>
      <p>“The truth of the matter is, there’s not nearly been enough evidence that has been acquired as to whether or not it is a gateway drug,” Biden said, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/joe-biden-marijuana-gateway-drug-but-research-doesnt-support-that-2019-11/">according to Business Insider</a>.</p>
      <p>“It’s a debate, and I want a lot more before I legalize it nationally. I want to make sure we know a lot more about the science behind it.”</p>
