      <h1>If you want to make more money as a developer in South Africa – these are the best coding languages</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://businesstech.co.za/news/author/staff-writer/" target="_blank">Staff Writer</a></address>
      <p>The majority of developers in South Africa list JavaScript as one of their primary languages, ahead of C#. However, Python is rapidly rising up the charts, and is in second place on developers’ ‘want-to-learn’ list, after being the fifth most used language in 2019.</p>
      <p>That’s according to technology talent marketplace OfferZen’s <a href="https://www.offerzen.com/state-of-sa-developer-nation-2019?">State of the Software Developer Nation survey</a>, which polled over 4,000 developers to find out about skills, work experience and opportunities among the South African developer community.</p>
      <p>Of the most popular languages developers chose, Go and Ruby are among the languages that pay the most across all levels of experience, the report said.</p>
      <p>Developers who know Python earn the third highest salary at junior and intermediate level. However, at senior level, developers who know Java earn about R1,500 more than those who know TypeScript or Python.</p>
      <p>PHP developers earn the lowest salaries, no matter how much experience they have.</p>

      <p>The majority of developers use JavaScript as one of their primary languages. Then, in second place is C# for both Cape Town and Gauteng.</p>
      <p>However, the two locations differ on their third most used language with Python as third in Cape Town and Java in Gauteng, OfferZen said.</p>

      <p>According to the report, Python is the up and coming language in 2020.</p>
      <p>“JavaScript is still in the lead – but only just! Python is slithering up the charts across South Africa at a rapid rate in 2020. It moves into second place on developers’ want to learn list, after being the fifth most used language in 2019,” the report said.</p>
      <p>Java takes a major hit, falling into fifth place behind C# and TypeScript despite being the third most widely used language in 2019.</p>

      <p>Hitting the keyboard early on in life can make a big difference later on in a tech career, OfferZen said.</p>
      <p>Take developers who have 1-2 years of experience, for example: Those who started coding before the age of 12 currently earn the biggest salaries.</p>
      <p>In fact, just over half of the developers who started coding before they started high school now earn more than R60,000 per month, while 60% of those who only started in their late 20s earn less than R30,000 per month.</p>
