      <p><b>Kampala.</b> Marie Stopes Uganda has been directed to recall two batches of Life Guard brand condoms from the Ugandan market following customers’ complaints.</p>
      <p>According to a letter issued by the National Drug Authority (NDA), the condoms from batches- 19040205 and 19050105 manufactured in April and May 2019 with expiry dates for March and April 2024 do not meet market standards.</p>
      <p>Ms Victoria Nambasa, the product safety officer at NDA says the condoms were not free from “holes and burst properties”.</p>
      <p> It is estimated that over 4 million condoms produced in the batches will be affected. On the open market, a packet of Life Guard condoms costs between Shs1,500 and Shs2,000.</p>
      <p>"We have given you two weeks to submit a recall status report indicating the details of distribution and the clients that have been notified of the recall," Ms Nambasa said in the directive. </p>
      <p>Mr Fred Ssekyana, the Public Relations Officer of the NDA says that they have teams in the field to ensure that the directive is enforced.</p>

      <p>"The process is on and we are working with the distributors of the condoms to make sure that the affected batches are off the market," Mr Ssekyana said.</p>
      <p>Mr Sam Lemi, from Marie Stopes says they have begun the recall process and it should be complete soon.</p>
      <p>"We started the process and expect it to be completed soon. We are investigating what could have gone wrong," Mr Lemi said. </p>
      <p>According to data from the Ministry of Health, an estimated 800 million condoms are needed to protect Ugandans from unplanned pregnancies, HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.</p>
