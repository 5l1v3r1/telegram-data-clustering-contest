      <p>If you’re looking for a new and <i>green</i> <a href="https://futurism.com/terraform-mars-videogame-surviving-mars-green-planet">strategy game</a> for your collection, the people at Blue Orange Games have just the thing. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074K5W5N5/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=futurism0b-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B074K5W5N5&amp;linkId=82b8a7aeda47c57cd6d2e9dfe43f5d19">It’s called <i>Photosynthesis</i></a>, and it puts two-to-four players in control of their own living forests, planting trees and guiding them through their life-cycles from tiny seeds all the way through full bloom and the cyclical process known as rebirth.</p>
      <p>Described as “the evergreen strategy game,” <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074K5W5N5/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=futurism0b-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B074K5W5N5&amp;linkId=82b8a7aeda47c57cd6d2e9dfe43f5d19"><i>Photosynthesis</i> </a>awards points to players when leaves from their trees collect energy from the rays of the sun (the process from which the game gets its name). Players choose where to plant their trees and where they’ll grow, absorbing the optimum amounts of sunlight and strategizing when and where the trees will be separated from light in shadow. The game also boasts several different tree sizes and species options, so the gameplay can get almost as complex as managing a real-world ecosystem.</p>

The mechanics are simple enough that you can pick up on things by three or four turns and not have any questions. The game benefits from well thought out aggressive play, luck is not a factor. You’ll make some great moves, you’ll likely get screwed over a couple times. And, you’ll have a cool forest to look at when the game ends.”</blockquote>
