      <p>OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) - The Oklahoma Supreme Court has ruled that cities may approve some regulations of the medical marijuana industry.</p>
      <p>The court on Tuesday dismissed an appeal by the city of Broken Arrow in a case filed by marijuana grower Austin Miller. Miller said the city exceeded its authority in 2018 by adopting regulations including a $2,500 annual permit fee on dispensaries and allowing marijuana to only be grown indoors in industrial areas.</p>
      <p>The state Supreme Court first overturned a district judge’s injunction blocking the rules. Now, it has ruled that legislative amendments earlier this year to the voter-approved law allowing medical marijuana allows cities to use “standard planning and zoning procedures” but not prevent marijuana businesses from opening.</p>

        <p>Miller attorney Ron Durbin called the ruling “a travesty” because he said the amendments apply retroactively. At attorney for the city declined comment.</p>
