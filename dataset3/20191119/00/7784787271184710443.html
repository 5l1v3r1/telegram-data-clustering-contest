      <h3>Melbourne champion Garry Lyon has dubbed the scrapping of an annual local footy event as “disgraceful”, claiming country footy leagues have been misled and calling on the AFL to “write the cheque” to keep the competition alive.</h3>
      <p>It was revealed on Monday night that the annual AFL Victoria Community Championships, which involved 30 teams in 2019, had been scrapped for next year due to an array of reasons.</p>
      <p>AFL Victoria community football and development manager Stephen O'Donohue said many stakeholders believe the format needs to be updated and changed, adding they had concerns over costs, travel, the ranking system and player availability.</p>

      <p>The sense among most metropolitan leagues is they’re happy to be free of the interleague demands – both financial and logistical – for 2020, as it’s them and clubs that have to foot the majority of the bill. One champs game could cost a league at least $10,000 and as much as $20,000 to fund essentials like travel, uniform and coaching.</p>
      <p>Some major ones, such as the Eastern Football League and Essendon District Football League, have dropped out of the competition in recent years, while the Victorian Amateur Football Association has organised its own games against rival leagues.</p>

      <p>While one source told <i>foxfooty.com.au</i> the community champs had been “dying a slow death” over recent years, it’s understood many country leagues have been left disappointed by the decision.</p>
      <p>Speaking on <i>SEN Breakfast</i>, Lyon said the call made him “sick in the guts”, pleading with the AFL to provide the champs with a financial boost.</p>
      <p>“If it comes down to money … 30 teams, 10 grand at 300 grand – write the cheque AFL,” Lyon told <i>SEN Breakfast</i>. “You’ve got that much damn money, write the cheque and keep the AFL (Community) Championships going.</p>
      <p>“Ten grand to keep what has been an iconic part of it going, keep it going … It seems country footy is getting the bum steer on this one.</p>
      <p>“It’s not good enough … it’s disgraceful in my eyes.</p>

      <p>Former AFL Gippsland commissioner John White said the hefty cost for leagues to partake in the championships should be covered by the AFL because it “showcases their game and puts it in the limelight for the communities”.</p>
      <p>White said there was some merit in suggestions interest in the competition had waned, but claimed it was a “small representation of a bigger picture”.</p>
      <p>“This is a real bad decision on behalf of community and country footy,” White old <i>SEN Breakfast</i>.</p>
      <p>“Once again here we are watching the AFL with its hugely deep pockets full of money, but unfortunately, they’ve got very short arms and they won’t dig into their own coffers to support the community and country football environment.”</p>
