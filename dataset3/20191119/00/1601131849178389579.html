      <h1>Early Galaxy A11 details show that it will ship with Android 10</h1>

      <p>Samsung is gearing up to <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/rumor-2020-galaxy-a-camera-upgrades/">refresh its entire Galaxy A series for 2020.</a> The company shook up the series this year with multiple models that were packed with tech and priced competitively. We should expect a similar strategy for 2020.</p>
      <p>We have received some early details for one of the devices. It’s going to have model number <b>SM-A115</b> and may be branded as the Galaxy A11. Even though it will be the cheapest model in the lineup, it’s still going to ship with Android 10.</p>
      <h3>Galaxy A11 to come with Android 10 out of the box</h3>
      <p>Samsung <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/trademarks-reveal-how-samsung-might-name-the-galaxy-a-series-in-2020/">filed trademarks for the 2020 Galaxy A series</a> with the EUIPO four months ago. The filing secured monikers from “<b>A11</b>” and “<b>A21</b>” going all the way up to “<b>A91</b>.” It’s safe to assume that these are the names that Samsung is going to assign the upcoming series of its affordable devices. They will be successors of existing devices like the Galaxy A10 (SM-A105), Galaxy A20 (SM-A205), so on and so forth.</p>
      <p>As per the information we have received so far, the SM-A115 is going to feature 32GB of internal storage. It’s going to be available in black and white colors with <a href="https://www.sammobile.com/samsung/android-10-update">Android 10</a> running out of the box. Since this will be a budget device, it will be primarily made available in markets across Asia and Africa. You can expect the other specs to be fairly modest as well.</p>
      <p>This bodes well for the 2020 Galaxy A series in that all models should come with Android 10 by default. Since Samsung is looking for an edge in this segment of the market, offering competitively priced phones that run the latest version of Android will definitely be a plus point.</p>
      <p>Samsung started rolling out the new Galaxy A handsets quite early this year so it may only take a couple of months for the 2020 Galaxy A devices to hit the market. We’ll be sure to update you as more information comes in.</p>
