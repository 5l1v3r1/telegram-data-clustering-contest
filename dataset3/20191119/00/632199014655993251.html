      <p>BMW will launch its first electric compact executive car in 2021 called the i4.</p>
      <p>The new model will be based on the 4 Series, in Gran Coupe body type, and will have a potential power output of more than 500PS.</p>
      <p>Rivalling the Tesla Model 3, the zero-emission i4 will be desirable among fleet users with low BIK.</p>
      <p>It uses the brand’s fifth generation electric powertrain system that will debut in the iX3 next year.</p>
      <p>The i4 will have a range of almost 380 miles and will be able to recharge at 150kW, adding 60 miles in six minutes.</p>
      <p>Its 80kWh battery is more efficient than batteries used in existing electric BMW models, thanks to developments at the brand's Battery Cell Competence Centre.</p>
      <p>BMW’s latest eDrive technology uses a highly integrated drive system in which the electric motor, transmission and power electronics are accommodated in a single housing. This drive system can be fitted to a number of different models in a range of output levels and scaled to suit varied segments.</p>
      <p>By 2023, the BMW Group will have 25 models with electrified drive in its program, including Mini and Rolls Royce models. With a model portfolio that includes efficient combustion engines as well as modern plug-in hybrid and purely electric drive.</p>
