      <p>Dozens of Passengers had a lucky escape Monday night after their moving Bus caught fire at Beposo-Kyekyewere near Teacher Mante along Suhum to Nsawam stretch of the Accra to Kumasi Highways.</p>
      <p>The fully loaded Hyundai Bus with registration number GN 8298 â€“ 15 moving towards Suhum direction from Accra caught fire causing chaotic exit by passengers onboard.</p>
      <p>Although the passengers and the driver escaped unhurt before the bus was eventually consumed by the fire, they were terribly traumatized.</p>
      <p>According to report, it took personnel of Ghana National Fire Service from Nsawam 25 minutes to douse the inferno but the bus was completely burnt beyond recognition.</p>
      <p>The Deputy Public Relations Officer of the Eastern Regional Police Command, Sergeant Francis Gomado, told Kasapa News, Police and Fire Service Officials are jointly investigating the cause of the fire.</p>
      <p>He, however, appealed to the traumatized driver and the passengers who fled the scene before Police arrival to return to assist the investigation.</p>
