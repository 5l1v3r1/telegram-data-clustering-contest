      <p>The Green Party is setting out plans to invest a £100 billion a year in tackling climate change as it publishes its manifesto for the General Election on December 12.</p>
      <p>It will include legislation for a “Green new deal”, intended to set Britain on track to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2030.</p>
      <p>The party – which is strongly pro-Remain – is also promising a People’s Vote bill for a fresh referendum on Britain’s relationship with the EU.</p>
      <p>Under the party’s plans, it would raise £91 billion a year for the next decade for capital expenditure on tackling climate change.</p>

      <p>A further £9 billion a year in operational spending would be funded through raising taxes, including corporation tax which would rise to 24%.</p>
      <p>The party argues that borrowing on such a scale is both justified – given the looming “climate crisis” – and prudent as it would kick start economic and social regeneration.</p>
      <p>It says public sector investment would act as a catalyst for private sector investment, as private investors seek to share in the financial rewards of a transition to a low carbon future.</p>
      <p>Co-leader Jonathan Bartley said: “We’re proud to put forward a manifesto which puts us on track to remain in the European Union and make the whole country carbon neutral by 2030, while delivering social justice across Britain.</p>

      <p>“It’s the most ambitious Green new deal proposed anywhere in the world. While the other parties are trying to catch up, we’re still racing ahead, reaching new horizons.”</p>
      <p>In other measures, the party said it would increase NHS funding by at least £6 billion a year, scrap university tuition fees and introduce a universal basic income with a “phased-in unconditional payment to everyone at a level above their subsistence needs”.</p>
      <p>It would also scrap the first-past-the-post system in elections, replacing it with proportional representation, create a fully elected House of Lords and extend voting rights to 16 and 17 year-olds.</p>
