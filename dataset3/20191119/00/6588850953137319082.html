      <p>National Democratic Congress (NDC) Member of Parliament for Kumbungu Constituency, Ras Mubarak has gone contrary to the position of his party on the December 17 referendum.<br/><br/>According to him, it will be hypocritical for anyone to suggest that political parties are not already involved in the local level elections as both the ruling New Patriotic Party (NPP) and the main opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) sponsor candidates to win the assembly elections.<br/><br/>The Minority in Parliament had earlier supported the amendment but suddenly changed its position, arguing that allowing the election of Metropolitan, Municipal and District Chief Executives (MMDCEs) on partisan lines would further polarise the country.<br/><br/>The NDC has, therefore, called on Ghanaians to vote ‘No’ in the December 17 referendum.<br/><br/>But reacting on <b>Okay FM’s</b> 'Ade Akye Abia' Morning Show to the sudden turnaround of his party on the position of the December 17 referendum, Ras Mubarak said the argument of the NDC that the political involvement in the local level elections will destroy the country is not convincing enough. <br/><br/><i>“We have had instances from both parties [NPP and NDC] where they support candidates in assembly elections. One of the key arguments I am hearing is that it will destroy our local governance system simply because politics at the top is very dirty and corrupt. If we admit and agree that there is a problem with politics at the top, let’s stop playing the ostrich and fix the problem at the top,”</i> he argued.<br/><br/>He, however, urged all the political parties and stakeholders to come together to build a consensus on the best way to fix the problems associated with politics at the top in order not to permeate to the local level.<br/><br/>He insisted that the argument of the NDC is not enough to ask Ghanaians especially its members and supporters to vote ‘No’ in the upcoming December 17 referendum as the argument portrays politics as a bad practice.<br/><i>“ . . then we must as well argue that we go back to Monarchy because clearly, the argument is that fundamentally something is wrong with politics. I am saying there is nothing wrong with politics; politics needs a bit of honesty and courage in doing what is right in the national interest,”</i> he argued. Featured Video</p>
