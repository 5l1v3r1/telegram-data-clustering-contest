      <p><i>Retention wall of railway underpass on Babasaheb Ambedkar Road has developed cracks and could collapse anytime</i> <br/><br/>Most Bengalureans will still remember the infamous and shocking collapse of a wall more than a decade ago outside Veterinary College near Hebbal, which claimed the life of Sanjana Singh, a 17-year-old student of Kendriya Vidyalaya. If the authorities concerned fail to take precautionary measures, a similar incident is waiting to happen at a railway underpass near Tannery Road. <br/><br/>The retention wall of the railway underpass on Babasaheb Ambedkar Road was constructed over 45 years ago and has now become weak. It can collapse any moment. It will be a major disaster as thousands of commuters depend on this underpass to reach Tannery Road, Pottery Town and other areas from Shivajinagar, Frazer Town etc.</p>

      <p>The crack on the retention wall is so wide that a human’s palm can fit in; sharp-edged metal from the old barrier can cause harm to the pedestrians and two-wheeler riders</p>
      <p>The underpass was inaugurated by the then administrator of corporation of the city of Bangalore, N Lakshman Rau, on December 26, 1975. <br/><br/>C Sampath, Bangalore Political Action Committee (B.PAC) leader said, “I think the retention wall belongs to the railways. The railways is responsible to fix it to prevent any major accidents. The road is narrow and always congested. The authorities concerned should fix the issue as soon as possible to avoid a major disaster.” <br/><br/>Emphasising the need to inspect all the old railway bridges and underpasses in and around Bengaluru, Sai Datta, a social activist, opined that the railway authorities should inspect these structures periodically and fix the issues as and when they arise. “The underpass at Tannery Road is very old. <br/><br/>Not only the Tannery Road underpass, but the railway authorities also have to inspect the underpass near Windsor Manor Junction. The quality of construction of these underpasses is doubtful. The authorities have to ensure that the contractor maintains the construction quality across all underpasses and railway bridges. This will ensure that no lives are lost and properties are damaged in the future,” added Datta. <br/><br/>P Prabhakaran, a social activist from Benson Town, criticised the railway authorities for neglecting the underpass for all these years. “Many people may be killed or injured if the retention wall collapses. It has already developed cracks that have weakened it considerably. It is very difficult to use this underpass during the monsoon. The authorities should reconstruct or strengthen the retention wall before the onset of the next monsoon to avoid any major accidents,” said Prabhakaran.</p>
      <p>If I receive the photo of the underpass, I will send it to the engineer for spot inspections ­</p>
      <p>–AN Krishna Reddy, SW Railway<br/><br/>He said there is much to do at the underpass to ensure smooth movement of vehicles. <br/><br/>“The authorities have constructed steel barriers to prevent overloaded trucks to pass through the underpass to prevent the railway bridge from getting damaged. However, the authorities have not removed the old barriers. This causes congestion at the underpass,” he said, adding that the footpath lining the underpass has to be strengthened for the benefit of pedestrians. <br/><br/><br/>Meanwhile, South Western Railway (Bangalore) Public Relations Officer AN Krishna Reddy said that he will inform the railway engineers to inspect the spot. “If I receive the photo of the underpass, I will send it to the engineer concerned for spot inspection,” said Krishna Reddy.</p>
