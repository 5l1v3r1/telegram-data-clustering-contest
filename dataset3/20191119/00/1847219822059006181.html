      </p>
      <p><a href="https://www.lrt.lt/en/news-in-english">German public broadcaster Deutsche Welle reports</a>, that three Ukrainian ships were returned on Monday, November 18, almost a year after the Russian navy seized the vessels in the Kerch Strait.</p>
      <p>Ukrainian authorities confirmed the return, a day after tug boats were seen towing the vessels through the strait that separates Crimea from the Russian mainland. Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs previously announced the handover on Monday.</p>
      <p>The step was «in accordance with the agreements reached with the Ukrainian side,» sources from Russian intelligence agency FSB’s Crimean branch told Russian news agency Interfax.</p>
      <p>DW reports that the news comes ahead of a crucial summit between the leaders of Ukraine and Russia. The handover is seen as an important step in resolving the ongoing five-year conflict in eastern Ukraine.</p>
