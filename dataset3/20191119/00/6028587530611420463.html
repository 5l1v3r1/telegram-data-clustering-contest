      <p>It’s been over 2 years since musician,<a href="https://www.instagram.com/perfumegenius/?hl=en"><b> Mike Hadreas</b></a>, released his fourth studio album called “<a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/23137-no-shape/">No Shape</a>” to critical acclaim. Adding to a discography of glittering, visceral music that transcends genre, the reach of his musical moniker,<a href="https://perfumegenius.org/"> Perfume Genius</a>, isn’t limited to one medium for expression. Teaming up with the Seattle-based dancer and choreographer, <a href="http://katewallich.com/#/">Kate Wallich</a>, Hadreas has reemerged in an evolved form with a contemporary dance and music show called “The Sun Still Burns Here.”  Together with Wallich’s dance company, <a href="https://vimeo.com/theycfamily">The YC</a>, Hadreas composed and created the work commissioned by<a href="https://www.stgpresents.org/"> Seattle Theatre Group</a> and <a href="https://massmoca.org/">Mass MoCA</a>. Having already premiered in Seattle, the production completed another run of 4 shows at New York City’s <a href="https://joyce.org/">Joyce Theater</a> for the East Coast premiere of the show. Featuring original new music like the recently released, “Eye in the Wall,” (a song that Hadreas described as a “cosmic peep show”), the production is an intense and unflinching physical exploration of a wide range of emotion.</p>
      <p>I spoke to the artists in collaboration about the conception of this idea, their working relationship and what to expect from the the contemporary dance piece.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Roytel Montero: How has this collaboration between the two of you come together? </b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Mike Hadreas: </b>It’s been a while. It started with just me and Kate’s conversations about what we wanted it to be. We wanted it to be music and dance not next to each other but fully together. I wanted to sing and dance, I wanted to be part of a dance and for her to be a part of the music but we had to make that in order to do that so I just started with an emotional world at first by sending images back and forth or ideas of what we want to be and what we want to do back and forth for a while.</p>
      <p><b>Kate Wallich: </b>I had never worked with a composer who’s also a performer so that was exciting to me like I saw the potential for my dance and choreography to be more than I thought it could be. Someone singing with a microphone, I was like that’s dance. How can we roll around inside of that? It’s been a 19-month creation process and we probably had about 15 weeks in the actual studio together.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Montero: What are some of the themes explored in the show?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Wallich: </b>I don’t think about my work being goal-oriented but I have been trying to do something clearly and I think that meeting Mike and working together in this process, I was realizing that we really do similar things differently but we’re trying to get to the same place beyond and when doing that with someone and making this thing that is ours together now we’re just making this thing together. So are the dancers and all of our collaborators. There’s not a specific narrative to the work in a linear way but we take you places and on a journey. </p>
      <p><b>Hadreas:</b> We mapped it out but it’s more like a spiritual map. There’s always been a place I wanted to go to but it’s not always felt like a place people want me to go like I’m not supported, it’s confusing or too much or too little and this is like a way to have all that exist at the same time and be okay and be safe. It’s everything. It’s campy but also ultra-serious. </p>
      <p><b>Wallich: </b>It’s soft but it’s hard but it’s sad and happy. I think we like extremes and we like where there’s dissonance between those, where there’s harmony between those, there’s no edges between those and there aren’t boundaries or there are boundaries sometimes so I think that there’s a lot of that happening and there’s a lot of agency for all the collaborators to create that journey for themselves. We are very much so ourselves we are not characters- it’s real life. We are individuals inside of the work. There’s a world. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Montero: What’s the reception been like? Is there a difference between how you created it and how you’re presenting it now after putting it on for an audience?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Hadreas: </b>People want different things and in the end they’re gonna get what we give them but I want them to get what we intended. I want them to feel how I feel. If I hear something good or bad but it’s not what I actually wanted them to experience, those are the kinds of things that we think about when we go back and shape the show but if people don’t like it but they completely got what we were trying to do then I’m into that. </p>
      <p><b>Wallich:</b> I feel like it’s just a gift to be able to turn around after getting to experience a premiere with an audience in Seattle and turn around a few weeks later and we get to do it again and again so that’s such an opportunity to get even deeper into it and get more at that thing. It’s not like we’re taking a right-hand turn and going down a new path, it just feels like refining and getting clear but I also like the confusion of a premiere where it’s just sort of hot and fresh. Also as a performer, I feel like it’s nice digging even more.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Montero: How would you describe your working relationship together? </b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Hadreas</b>: I can see when she’s doing her work that she’s coming from the same place as me and she wants the same thing. Even if I couldn’t do it or if it took a while to get where she was I knew what she wanted and we share that. </p>
      <p><b>Wallich</b>: I’m surprised by all of this, I didn’t think that was going to happen. My working relationships with my collaborators have always been great and I love my company, they’re amazing. I think that we are both trying to do the same thing with our work and we both recognize that in each other and we both feed that in each other and so working together was really easy. There wasn’t struggle really. Challenges were external in a lot of ways. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Montero: How did you go about getting the show to 4 different cities?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Hadreas</b>: This is whole different world than the music world. How far ahead in advance everything is planned out. It’s a production- it’s not just me and my band rolling up to somewhere and getting up there and going to town. This is a whole thing so it takes a lot of people to do it and it takes a lot of people to bring it to places and stuff so I let her do all of that. </p>
      <p><b>Wallich</b>: It’s been so fun learning about each other’s worlds too because it’s so different but the Seattle Theater Group commissioned the work co-commissioned by The Joyce and so generally what that means is like we knew that the east coast premiere would be at the Joyce so we knew that Mass Moca was willing to provide so in June we got to go and try out all our sets and that was crazy to be able to do. All of this was decided like a year and a half ago. It’s been in process for a long time so that’s kind of how it’s been and now we can kind of shape where we want it to go after this initial round of tour so that’s how it works. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Montero: Creating memorable live experiences is a new kind of currency in this media landscape. Were you thinking of this while putting the show together?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Hadreas: </b>People are craving that in music and they don’t know that they want body in the music. They want to see bodies, they want to see connection and something visceral and real life. Something that forces you to be present and have it not be that bad for a second or have it at least be different from what it is. That’s why I like it. That’s why I do everything that I do...People need different things now, they need more angles. They need it to be 360 in order for them to be forced into feeling. </p>
      <p><b>Wallich: </b>We thought about that during the creation. Getting us together to do this was the start of that. When I think about the grant language of saying “merging audiences” and “bringing mediums together” and asking “what can they create?” I get that but I want that authentically. I want to make the thing that brings people together and feel that and let everybody feel that and experience that so I think that without actually thinking about it that’s what we lack in our own lanes. I lack that in dance. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Montero: Are there any updates you want to share on the Perfume Genius front?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Hadreas: </b>I hope to release the music from this project. There are songs that I’m singing the whole time but there’s another record I made that’s coming out in the Spring and I’m kind of in the beginning of making that world more real right now and Kate’s gonna be there too. I’m having this vision right now where I can bring this to my Perfume Genius shows. I’m really happy with the record that’s coming out. I feel like I found a way to not sacrifice me wanting to go far and experiment but not lose what I think I’m good at that makes me connect to other people. Sometimes I’ll try to sign myself into something and sacrifice something else like I’ll sacrifice the story or I’ll sacrifice the connection because I just so badly want something to explode but now I can explode and the story is still there. </p>
