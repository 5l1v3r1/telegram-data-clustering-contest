      <p>The short answer is YES, but let’s take a look at why <a href="https://www.columbiacrest.com/">Columbia Crest</a>’s Grand Estate Cabernet Sauvignon is such a screaming deal.</p>

      <h3>It starts in the vineyard</h3>
      <p>Like all wines worth drinking, what comes out of the bottle has everything to do with the quality of the grapes. Since launching in the late 1970s, Columbia Crest had an edge in sourcing great fruit because of its Eastern Washington location. Its first winemaker, <a href="https://www.washingtonwine.org/wine/history/groundbreakers/doug-gore">Doug Gore</a>, worked diligently to cultivate rock solid relationships with growers, a tradition that continues for the current senior director of winemaking, Katie Nelson.</p>
      <p>During a recent meeting with renowned grower <a href="https://www.washingtonwine.org/wine/history/groundbreakers/dick-boushey">Dick Boushey</a>, Nelson learned that the Grand Estates Cab is one of his favorite everyday drinking reds. “It’s such a great deal,” Boushey said in a phone interview. “I know a lot of growers who consider it their house wine.”</p>
      <p>The fruit that goes into each vintage might vary from year-to-year, but Nelson explained that’s because the winery is looking for a consistent style: “We want the showcase the fruit.”</p>
      <p>Because the winery contracts with a long list of growers throughout the Columbia Valley, the Cabernet Sauvignon grape harvest is usually staggered over an extended period. That allows the production team to treat the fruit with the kind of care that creates the elegant tannins that has become the Columbia Crest style.</p>
      <p>“When it comes in, we gently pump over, we’re not heavy handed,” Nelson said.</p>
      <p>The wine is aged in French and American oak barrels, with the latter delivering a distinctive spice characteristic. “It’s like the extrovert at a party, bringing some intensity,” she said.</p>

      <h3>Those stellar scores</h3>
      <p>A decade ago, Harvey Steiman wrote a glowing description of Columbia Crest’s 2005 Reserve Cabernet when it was named the <a href="https://www.winespectator.com/articles/wine-of-the-year-columbia-crest-41241">top wine of the year</a> in The Wine Spectator’s annual Top 100 countdown, specifically noting consistency as a virtue.</p>
      <p>Since then, there have more accolades:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>88 points – 2016 Grand Estates Cabernet Sauvignon, Columbia Valley | <i>Wine Spectator</i> (Aug. 2018)</li>
        <li>91 points – 2014 Grand Estates Cabernet Sauvignon, Columbia Valley | <i>Wine Spectator</i> (Oct. 2016)</li>
        <li>90 points – 2014 Grand Estates Cabernet Sauvignon, Columbia Valley | <i>Wine Enthusiast</i> (Dec. 2016)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Beyond the high scores and rave reviews, there’s another reason this widely available wine is the bargain that needs to get loaded into your shopping basket.</p>

      <h3>It’s an excellent food wine</h3>
      <p>Some Cabs seem to call for steak, steak and more steak, but the softer, fruit-forward Columbia Crest works well alongside a lot of dishes including the traditional holiday feast.</p>
      <p>Nelson said she drinks it with wintery stews and hearty lasagna. It doesn’t overwhelm grilled salmon and can stand up to smoky ribs cooked low and slow. And did we mention? It’s under $10!</p>
