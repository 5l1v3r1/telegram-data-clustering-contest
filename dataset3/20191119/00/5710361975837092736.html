      <h1>Company logos vanish from Prince Andrew's website as sex scandal grows</h1>

      <p>LONDON (Reuters) - A scheme for entrepreneurs founded by Prince Andrew has taken down the logos of its corporate sponsors from its website, as firms and charities distance themselves from the British royal over a sex scandal.</p>
      <p>Andrew, Queen Elizabeth's second son, denies an allegation that he had sex with a 17-year-old girl procured for him by his friend Jeffrey Epstein, who killed himself in a U.S. prison in August while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.</p>
      <p>The scandal has escalated since Andrew's rambling denials and explanations in a disastrous TV interview aired on Saturday left many viewers incredulous, and his apparent lack of compassion for Epstein's victims drew widespread condemnation.</p>
      <p>The "supporters" page on the website of Andrew's Pitch@Palace program, which is intended as a platform to boost the work of entrepreneurs, was no longer available on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Cached versions of the page, saved in June this year, showed it carried the logos of brands including KPMG, AstraZeneca, Barclays (LON:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/barclays">BARC</a>), Cisco (NASDAQ:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/cisco-sys-inc">CSCO</a>), Standard Chartered (LON:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/standard-chartered">STAN</a>) and Bosch.</p>
      <p>Pitch@Palace did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.</p>
      <p>Insurance broker AON confirmed it had asked Pitch@Palace to remove its logo from the website. A spokesman said the logo had been placed on the site in error, as AON had no connection to the scheme.</p>
      <p>KPMG, which was listed as a "founding partner" on the old supporters page, ended its sponsorship of Pitch@Palace on Oct. 31. Several national media in Britain reported the decision was linked to adverse publicity around Andrew at that time. A KPMG spokesman declined to comment.</p>
      <p>Standard Chartered said it would not be renewing its sponsorship of Pitch@Palace when it expired at the end of the year.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for AstraZeneca said the company's three-year partnership with Pitch@Palace was due to expire at the end of the year and was being reviewed.</p>
      <p>Barclays, which has supported participants in the Pitch@Palace program for five years, declined to comment.</p>
      <p>Separately, British charity The Outward Bound Trust has called a board meeting this week to discuss Andrew's patronage, a spokeswoman said. Other non-profit organizations are having similar internal discussions, British media said.</p>
      <p>In Britain, royal patronage is usually considered an honor and a boost for charities.</p>
