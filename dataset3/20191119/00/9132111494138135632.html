      <p>The convenor of the Sureword Global Outreach, Rev. David Asamoah has tasked the Ghanaian youth to become agents of change in their communities, so as to make positive impacts on the lives of others.</p>
      <p>He said, the youth must start involving themselves in leadership positions in order for them to help solve challenges in their various communities.</p>
      <p>Rev. Asamoah who was speaking at a leadership conference at Adidome in the Central Tongu district said, it was high time some youth stop relying on politicians and start doing something for themselves so as to become the change agents their communities desired.</p>
      <p>“Politicians cannot do everything for you, you have to take charge of your lives, engage yourself with profitable ventures and try to impact your communities,” he stressed.</p>
      <p>Adding that, ” If you want to make a change, you must identify problems and provide solutions to them, you all came from various places that have problems, identify them and solve them, that is the only way you can make it big in life.”</p>
      <p>Also addressing the conference, was Madam Felicia Edem Attipoe, Ghana’s first female Aircraft Marshall, who entreated young women to venture into professions that are noted to be the preserve of men.</p>
      <p>She said, women were not created to be weak or inferior so must make sure, they don’t get intimidated by their male counterparts.</p>
      <p>“All the women sitting here must know that, you are strong and you can also make it in life. Do not allow anyone to discourage you, take up political leadership positions and make an impact,” she noted.</p>
      <p>The programme dubbed ‘Higher Level Leadership Conference for the people of Central Tongu’, was a collaboration between Sureword Global Outreach and Dela Radio, a local FM station.</p>
      <p>It was aimed at encouraging young people to actively participate in the development of their communities.</p>
      <p>Other speakers at the event include, Dr. Akofa Segebfia, a social development Activist, Rev Victor Sedo, an Educationist, Etse Agbemabiase a TV host and Patrick Agbolosu a Community Leader.</p>
      <p>The event was attended by traditional leaders, heads of Departments, corporate organizations and the youth from all walks of life.</p>
      <p>Sureword Global Outreach is a Christian organization with the objective of grooming young people in both Ghana and UK for leadership.</p>
