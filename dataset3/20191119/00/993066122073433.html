      <p>Tim Minchin has said his comedy is becoming less political because he is scared to say something that someone could use as “the defining factor”.</p>
      <p>The Australian comedian, 44, is in the UK with his comedy tour, called Back.</p>
      <p>He told Radio Times magazine: “I’m getting less political because I’m scared.</p>
      <p>“I don’t want to say something that someone decides they’re going to use as the defining factor.</p>
      <blockquote>I’m getting less political because I’m scared<cite>Tim Minchin</cite></blockquote>
      <p>“I’m devastated by Trump; I was there when he got elected.</p>
      <p>“I’m devastated by Brexit; I was here when that happened. We all feel like we have PTSD.”</p>
      <p>Minchin warned that “we have to be careful of our anger because it can be destructive”.</p>
      <p>He said: “It’s a scary thing to even talk about because if you try to turn an angry opinion into a more considered one, you’re told to check your privilege.</p>
      <p>“We are headed towards a world where the person who is most angry is the voice that seems to be most authentic in any debate – that is not what Mandela said, or Jesus.”</p>
      <p>This week’s Radio Times is out on Tuesday.</p>
