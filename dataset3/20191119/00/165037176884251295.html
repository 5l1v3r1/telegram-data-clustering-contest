        <b>Leeds United will have the services of Pablo Hernandez until at least 2022 after he renewed his contract.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Pablo Hernandez has signed a two-year contract extension </b>with Championship promotion challengers Leeds United.</p>
      <p>The winger is now tied to the Leeds<b> until the end of the 2021-22 season</b>. Hernandez initially arrived at Elland Road on loan from Al-Arabi in August 2016Â before signing permanently the following January. <b>Named Leeds' Player of the Year in each of his two full seasons</b> as a permanent member of the squad, <b>Hernandez scored 12 goals and laid on the same number of assists</b> last term.</p>
      <p>His outstanding campaign was<b> not enough to prevent Leeds from suffering agony in the play-offs</b>, though, as they missed out on promotion. Hernandez has scored two league goals and assisted as many this term, with Leeds again challenging for a return to the Premier League.</p>
