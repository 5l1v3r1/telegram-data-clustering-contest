      <h1>U mad? Weili Zhang ready to calm ‘angry’ Joanna Jedrzejczyk</h1>

      <p>Reigning Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) strawweight champion, Weili Zhang, doesn’t understand why former division titleholder, Joanna Jedrzejczyk, is so angry these days. Probably because “Magnum” doesn’t know what it feels like to lay an egg in her last three title fights.</p>
      <p>“Anywhere, anytime,” Jedrzejczyk told <a href="https://www.scmp.com/sport/martial-arts/mixed-martial-arts/article/3037867/ufc-joanna-jedrzejczyk-would-take-canoe-china">South China Morning Post</a>. “Bangkok, Sri Lanka, Warsaw, Toronto, it doesn’t matter where. For me, it doesn’t matter. I will make my way. Even if we have to take a canoe, I will make it to China and beat the shit out of her.”</p>
      <p>Taking a canoe from Poland to China could be challenging, even for an athlete as conditioned as Jedrzejczyk, because it’s roughly 4200 miles across dry land. Fortunately for all parties involved, the Wright brothers did their thing back in 1903.</p>
      <p>“She seems very angry? Don’t worry she will calm down,” Zhang wrote on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/zhangweilimma/">Instagram</a>. “I am ready now. Call my manager or call Dana White. I’m ready.”</p>
      <p>Jedrzejczyk got back into the 115-pound title hunt by turning away Michelle Waterson at UFC Fight Night 161 back in October. As for Zhang, she improved to 20-1 by smashing and trashing Jessica Andrade for the strawweight strap last August.</p>
      <p>All we need now are a couple of UFC contracts.</p>
