      <p>Anti-Corruption campaigner, Vitus Azeem says the latest standoff between the Auditor-General and the Economic and Organized Crime Office(EOCO) lends credence to the perception by some persons that Daniel Domelevo is being hounded.</p>
      <p>The Auditor-General has asked EOCO to stop investigating his office over alleged procurement breaches in the purchase of some vehicles because the investigative body lacks the mandate to do so.</p>
      <p>He’s issued a five-day ultimatum to EOCO to render an apology to him and his staff.</p>
      <p>Vitus Azeem in an interview described the standoff between the two state agencies as unfortunate as they both are supposed to be doing almost the same job which is fighting corruption.</p>
      <p>“That makes people to think that there must be an ulterior motive in this whole affair. Because I’m a colleague you’re inviting me to come for you to ask questions and all of a sudden you said I have to get somebody to bail me meanwhile you’re just at the beginning of the investigation and you have not found anything that I’ve done wrong.</p>
      <p>I think that there are two things, one, EOCO should quickly withdraw from it and render the apology and refer the matter to the Office of Special Prosecutor. Just say our attention has been drawn to the fact that we shouldn’t have started this investigation so please we are just referring it to you. But if EOCO insists then the Auditor-General will also evoke his right and the law that you have no right to do this and I’m not going to subject myself to this.”</p>
