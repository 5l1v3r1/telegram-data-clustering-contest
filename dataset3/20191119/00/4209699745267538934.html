      <h1>India Shipped In Over 336,000 BPD Of Oil From Nigeria In October</h1>
      <h2>The country considered Nigerian petroleum more than it did import from the United States – a revision of September’s trend.</h2>

      <p>One of Nigeria’s most important oil customers, India, purchased over 336,000 barrels of crude daily from the country in October. </p>
      <p>The country considered Nigerian petroleum more than it did import from the United States – a revision of September’s trend.</p>
      <p>Unnamed sources informed Reuters that India bought a record 336,000 barrels per day of oil from the US, but the country was fourth to Nigeria on the Asian state’s choice of import. </p>
      <p>The reason for the Nigerian preference is down to new rules from the International Maritime Organisation saying fuel used on ships must have reduced Sulphur content, analysts say.</p>
      <p>“Indian demand for gasoil has been falling but overall Asian demand has been relatively strong because of new marine fuel rules from January. </p>
      <p>"And good diesel cracks is prompting refiners to buy distillate rich crudes like that of Nigeria,” an analyst with Refinitiv, Ehsan Ul Haq, said.</p>
      <p>The outlook for the entirety of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries was gloomier however.</p>
      <p>The third largest oil importer purchased 3.43m barrels of oil from the OPEC alliance daily in October. </p>
      <p>This is seven per cent less than the 80 per cent stake the cartel supplied in September. </p>
      <p>On cue with predictions from the International Energy agency that demand for oil from OPEC will decline by a million barrels in 2020, India sourced more of the foregone seven per cent from the competitive US and other none OPEC countries. </p>
      <p>Data sourced by the news agency also showed that demand for fuel by the 1bn plus population declined by 1.4 per cent in October, while diesel consumption is on a three-year low.</p>
      <p>Iraq regained top spot as the chief source of Indian oil from Saudi Arabia, while the Hindu-majority state increased its petroleum purchase volumes from September lows caused by refinery maintenance.</p>
