      <p>Macquarie has maintained its underperform rating on the stock, though it raised the target price by 24 percent to Rs 19,852 from Rs 16,000, implying 15.4 percent potential downside from current levels.</p>
      <p>"The strong recovery in sales growth is positive, but sustaining this will be key. The Q2 was driven by early festivals &amp; higher retail incentives, but there was margin pressure on higher retail incentives &amp; inflation in operating cost," said the brokerage.</p>
      <p>It cut FY19-22 EBITDA estimates by 1-4 percent on account of lower margin, but increased FY19-22 EPS estimates by 3-9 percent on lower tax rate.</p>
