      <p>Excessive speed was involved in separate single-vehicle, weekend crashes that killed one driver and left another with life-threatening injuries, say Calgary police.</p>
      <p>A man in his 50s died when the vehicle he was driving rolled and struck a light pole while merging onto Deerfoot Trail from 130 Avenue S.E. on Sunday afternoon. His front-seat passenger, a woman in her 20s, sustained serious injuries.</p>
      <p>Late Saturday night, a northbound vehicle struck a tree and caught fire after crossing the centre median on 52nd Street near Erin Woods Drive S.E.</p>
      <p>Firefighters pulled the driver from the wreck after extinguishing the fire. The driver, a man in his 50s, suffered life-threatening injuries, according to police.</p>
      <p>It’s not yet known if alcohol or drugs were factors in that crash, police said.</p>
