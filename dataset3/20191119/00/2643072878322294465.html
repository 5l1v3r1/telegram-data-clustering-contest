      <p>Femi Falana (SAN) has warned that Nigeria would continue to witness a decreasing rate of voter turnout in future elections if nothing is done to curtail election violence.</p>
      <p><b>Naija News</b> reports that the <b><a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/18/inec-declares-winner-of-kogi-governorship-election-release-final-results/"><u>Independent National Electoral Commission</u></a></b> (INEC) on Monday, declared the final results and winner of the 2019 Kogi governorship election result.</p>
      <p>According to the results, <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/yahaya-bello/"><u><b>Gov.</b> <b>Yahaya Bello</b></u></a> of the APC polled 406,222 votes to defeat other contestants including <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/musa-wada/"><u><b>Engr. Musa Wada</b></u></a> of the <b>Peoples Democratic Party</b> (PDP) who got 189,704 votes.</p>
      <p>While <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/18/inec-declares-apcs-david-lyon-winner-of-bayelsa-election/"><u><b>David Lyon of the APC was also declared the winner of the Bayelsa Governorship Election</b></u></a>.</p>
      <p>Lyon scored a total of 352,552 votes to defeat his closest rival and candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Nigeria’s main opposition party, Duoye Diri, who polled 143,172 votes.</p>
      <p>Both elections recorded violence, however, the Kogi State Guber election was seen to be the worse with shootings, killings and snatching of ballot boxes dominating reports from the state.</p>
      <p>Speaking on Monday as a panellist at a Digital Voting Summit, Falana said that in order to address the problem, those arrested for electoral violence in past elections, including that of Kogi, must be prosecuted and sanctioned.</p>
      <p><i>“We are talking about 34 per cent voter turnout in 2015″</i>, he said.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“If this trend of electoral brigandage, unprecedented electoral violence and thuggery continue, I am afraid in 2023 we will be talking of less than 10 per cent of registered voters-turnout.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Next time, you do not expect people to be willing to participate in a war, because election in Nigeria has become a war for the ruling class.”</i>
