      <p>The 19-year-old is contracted to <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/atalanta-bc/"><b>Atalanta BC</b></a> but is currently on loan with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/parma/"><b>Parma</b></a>, where he has scored twice and registered five assists in 12 Serie A appearances this season.</p>
      <p>According to <i>The Sun</i>, both United and Arsenal are interested in the midfielder, who is believed to be valued in the region of Â£40m by his parent club.</p>
      <p>The report claims that Inter Milan are still in a strong position to land the teenager, although the Italian giants will face strong competition from two of England's biggest clubs.</p>
      <p>Both Gunners boss <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/unai-emery/"><b>Unai Emery</b></a> and United manager <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/ole-gunnar-solskjaer/"><b>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer</b></a> have allegedly been impressed with the midfielder's creative ability and work rate.</p>
      <p>Kulusevski, who has largely operated on the right for Parma this season, joined Atalanta from Swedish club Brommapojkarna in 2016.</p>
