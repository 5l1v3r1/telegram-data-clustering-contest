      <p>Your mental health and wellbeing should be one of your top priorities, whether you are intentionally in pursuit for happiness or not. A lot of people struggle with their mental health, and a great percentage of these people have found themselves battling some of the most detrimental mental illnesses and conditions.</p>
      <p>You want to keep your sanity intact as well as maintain your mental health. While there are so many ways to achieve the end goal, flowers are one of the best and natural ways which you can improve your general wellbeing and mental health. So, what exactly is the relationship between flowers and your mental health and wellbeing?</p>
      <h3>They help calm and relax you</h3>
      <p>Flowers are known to trigger different emotions. A lot of people enjoy gardening because it simply helps them relax and meditate. It is the best way to escape the everyday hustle and bustle while communing with nature. Even better, flowers are great to help wind up after a long day of work and stress.</p>
      <p>Some flowers exude amazing scents which help calm the brain, and that is why most of these scents are used in the manufacture of essential oils. Dille, lavender, chamomile, and passion flowers, just to mention a few, are some of the <a href="https://florgeous.com/types-of-flowers/">most common flowers</a> for this purpose. You can simply have a combination of two or more of your favorite flowers and put them in your bedroom or the room you spend most of your time meditating.</p>
      <h3>They are energy boosters</h3>
      <p>Big seasonal blooms will simply bring you a burst of life and all sorts of energy. Some flowers are dramatic, from their color combinations to their size, and their scents. Whether you love gardening or having a pot or two in your space, bright vibrant flowers will always bring life while boosting your spirits.</p>
      <h3>They can help reduce anxiety</h3>
      <p>A lot of people struggle with anxiety and while there are many approaches to this, flower fragrance can gradually help to reduce anxiety. You can choose to grow a small and compact flower garden with a blend of different scented flowers. Aromatherapy is one of the best ways to naturally help reduce anxiety, and there are a number of essential oils that you can infuse into your space with a diffuser.</p>
      <h3>They can improve your mood</h3>
      <p>Flowers are great mood boosters. In fact, most people give flowers to sick people in the hospital to help cheer them up. Also, they are used to help individuals recovering from surgeries and other injuries in hospitals. Studies have shown that through planting and arranging flowers, the recovery process is accelerated.</p>
      <h3>They help you reflect</h3>
      <p>Part of your general wellbeing is self-reflection. The last thing you want is to lose track of your emotions and other driving factors. Flowers are calming, and spending some time in your small flower garden is a great way to self-reflect. You need to be aware of who you are both inside and outward, and by understanding yourself, then you know where to direct your energies</p>
      <h3>They help clear the mind</h3>
      <p>Spending time gardening is a good way to clear your mind and a good place to press the reset button. It can be hard to be productive at work when your mind is crowded, or when you are going through a tough time. You need to clear your mind to function properly and to maintain your mental health and wellness. Overworking your brain is going to take a toll on your general health, so take time every once in a while to clear your mind.</p>
      <h3>They improve happiness</h3>
      <p>Generally, flowers will make you happy. In so many ways, flowers will have a positive impact on you, as different flowers will have an effect on the human brain and emotions. For instance, you will likely derive joy from flowers that are orange in color. Have a few flowers in your living room, or sprinkle some petals in your bathroom before taking a dip in your bath of your favorite essential oil.</p>
      <p>Achieving mental health and general wellbeing is not hard, even if you are in a bad place. You just need to make it as deliberate as possible and develop a routine to be able to achieve what you desire.</p>
