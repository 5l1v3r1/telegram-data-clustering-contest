      <p>Sir Mark Rylance has said a recent trip to Hong Kong to discover the part his grandfather played in the Second World War made him realise there is no “right or wrong” in battle.</p>
      <p>The actor and Stop The War Coalition supporter, 59, made the trip during the recording of My Grandparents’ War, a Channel 4 programme marking the 80th anniversary of the conflict.</p>
      <p>The Oscar-winner’s grandfather Osmond Skinner, a banker for HSBC, defended the territory as part of the Hong Kong Volunteer Defence Force with little to no training.</p>

      <p>He was shot on Christmas Day and spent almost four years as a Japanese prisoner of war.</p>
      <p>Sir Mark said Japanese and British forces had been “fooled by ideas of empire” and that finding out about his grandfather’s treatment had only reinforced his anti-war leanings.</p>
      <p>He said: “The trip to Hong Kong convinced me of a rather shocking thing – that (I) don’t really believe in talk of Geneva Conventions and right and wrong behaviour in war, that there are war criminals and not war criminals, any more.</p>
      <p>“In the few fights I’ve been involved in – not with heavy weapons or artillery, just fisticuffs and anger and self-righteousness and defensiveness – everyone has been brutalised.</p>
      <p>“You can’t say to someone, ‘Oh, you didn’t fight fairly’.</p>
      <p>“I think that’s all a con to get young people to sign up, as if it will be a civilised thing they’re going to. I don’t believe it at all.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think he would agree with everything I say but I think he would be very interested to talk with me about it.</p>
      <p>“I think that he and I would share a faith that there is goodness in people. Os was a very just man, but he had been through something terrible.”</p>
      <p>My Grandparents’ War starts on Channel 4 on November 27.</p>
