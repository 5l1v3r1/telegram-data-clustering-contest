      <p>If you stick your head out the window and listen carefully, you will hear the shrieks, screams and howls of the cannabis community. In spite of the go-nowhere year that the United States has suffered concerning marijuana reform, a lot of these folks are still convinced that we have a fighting chance at legalizing the leaf before the end of the year. This optimism isn’t entirely their fault, however, as <a href="https://investorplace.com/2019/11/a-vote-on-federal-marijuana-legalization/">some reports</a> to surface over the past couple of days have sort of suggested that prohibition here in the Land of the Free is as good as dead. They’re all riled up because the word on the street is that a key Congressional committee is set to make a historic vote later this week on a measure aimed at removing cannabis from the confines of the Controlled Substances Act. And if that happens, well, weed would finally be legal nationwide similar to alcohol.What’s going on is that the House Judiciary Committee is set to debate a cannabis-related bill called the Marijuana Opportunity, Reinvestment, and Expungement (MORE) Act. This proposal, which currently has an impressive <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/3884/cosponsors?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22Marijuana+Opportunity%2C+Reinvestment%2C+and+Expungement+%28MORE%29+Act%22%5D%7D&amp;r=1&amp;s=1">55 cosponsors</a>, is designed “to decriminalize and deschedule cannabis, to provide for reinvestment in certain persons adversely impacted by the War on Drugs, to provide for expungement of certain cannabis offenses, and for other purposes.” The bill would basically allow states to set up their own marijuana laws without catching any heat from the federal government. </p>
      <p>And, in a lot of ways, the bill shows promise in achieving the latest goals of the cannabis trade. Small-time pot offenders, for example, could get their criminal records wiped clean under this legislation if it were to become law. The bill would also establish funding through a 5 percent tax on cannabis sales to repair the countless communities ravaged by drug war shenanigans. Taking it a step further, getting this sucker on the books would eventually make it impossible for law enforcement agencies to continue busting hundreds of thousands of people each year for simple possession. </p>
      <p>By all accounts, it’s a decent bill, and it may even deserve a fair shot from the boys and girls of Congress. </p>
      <p>The only problem is, while this proposal might be well-received when it goes before the committee on Wednesday, the chances of it going the distance – that is to say, for it to become law before 2019 comes to a screeching halt – are slim to none. Maybe even less than that. Why is that, you ask? Well, it’s simple really. Because we’re still dealing with the same Congress that has been failing at pot reform since the start of 2019. </p>
      <p>Sure, the Democratic-controlled House has done an admirable job getting the cannabis issue more floor time than any other Congress in history. But the Senate is still so stagnant on weed that it would take a <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeadams/2018/12/21/will-marijuana-legalization-be-our-christmas-gift-from-congress-in-2019/#7c5c234420a3">Christmas miracle</a> for the MORE Act (or any other cannabis-related measure) to so much as receive a second of its consideration.</p>
      <p>It’s not that I’m trying to be a downer and spoil everyone’s high hopes. But it’s difficult to avoid being pessimistic. Because how quickly we have forgotten about the great green hope known as the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeadams/2019/09/24/you-should-know-this-about-the-marijuana-industrys-safe-banking-bill/#16eb81ee7f59">Secure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Act</a>. This piece of legislation, which was the pride and joy of the pot scene, was intended to give financial institutions permission from Uncle Sam to do business with the cannabis industry. </p>
      <p>The SAFE Act is a modest proposal since it really does nothing to further the agenda of the marijuana movement. It doesn’t make weed any more legal anywhere in the country, nor does it make changes to the prohibition standard we’ve got going on in the U.S. of A. All this bill would do is make banks prosecution proof for accepting money generated through the growing and selling of marijuana. And because of that, more cannabis companies would be permitted to establish bank accounts. That’s it, nothing more. And while this measure was pushed through earlier this year by the House, it remains in a dark closet somewhere in the upper chamber waiting for <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeadams/2019/10/10/marijuana-industry-finally-has-the-attention-of-senator-mcconnell-but-is-it-using-it-wisely/#afb2fc748548">Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell</a> to shake the dust off. Considering that McConnell is still on the fence about weed – even if it is just so the industry can move past their piggy bank ways — there is a distinct possibility that it might not get put to a vote anytime in the near future. </p>
      <p>Therefore, as much as it is a positive that Congress is finally talking about ending marijuana prohibition in the United States, there still isn’t enough of a unified effort on Capitol Hill to actually get it done. There just isn’t. I hate to be the bearer of bad news this close to the holidays, but Congress isn’t going to legalize marijuana this week or even this year. The best shot this nation has at seeing a turning point will depend on the outcome of the 2020 election. Until then, passing cannabis-related legislation through the House only to have it ignored in the Senate is just a sad game of pitch and catch — one where some bratty kid runs off and hides the ball so <i>no one</i> else can play.</p>
