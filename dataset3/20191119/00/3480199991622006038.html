      <p>A California appeals court is strongly inclined to give new life to the lawsuits of two men who accuse Michael Jackson of molesting them when they were boys.</p>
      <p>In a tentative ruling, the 2nd District Court of Appeal said lawsuits from James Safechuck and Wade Robson should be reconsidered by the trial court that dismissed them.</p>
      <p>The decision is based on a new California law that gives sex abuse victims longer to sue.</p>
      <p>The Jackson estate has strongly denied Robson and Safechuckâ€™s allegations.</p>
