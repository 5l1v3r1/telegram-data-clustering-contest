      <h1>Advice to Travelers and Wannabe Travelers: Keep Moving</h1>

      <p>Looking for the perfect holiday gift for the person who has everything? Consider <i>Places I Remember: Tales Truths, Delights from 100 countries</i> by Lea Lane, author of nine books and a contributor to guidebooks, magazines and websites. While <i>Places I Remember</i> would purport to be a travel memoir (with chapters arranged by country beginning with Andorra and ending with Zimbabwe), it is much more than reminisces on different destinations. It tells little stories – poignant and funny and sad – about things that happened to Lea Lane while on the road. The book covers fifty years of her travels as well as illustrated photos  by Greg Correll from 100 countries.</p>

      <p>Here’s a small example of her writing on Indonesia:</p>
      <p>“Tiny example of how things have changed over the years. Flying on an Indonesian airline to Jakarta in 1989, most of the male passengers were smoking, even though the “No Smoking” sign was evident. When I complained to the flight attendant that the cabin was filled with smoke, she said, ‘Mind your own business,’ scowled, and walked away. Another change in this current world? I’m reading that Indonesia plans to move the capital to Borneo before Jakarta sinks into the sea.”</p>
      <p>Lane goes on to tell about how she took a side trip to Bali and hired a driver to show her around when they came upon a cremation ceremony in progress. Invited to join, she stood on the grass watching as the wood under the dead body was lighted, and as the flames crackled, she felt sharp, painful sensations and realized she was standing on a bed of fire ants. She writes, “I hopped away too late, as the insects had already crawled up my legs, biting and stinging as they climbed. I jumped around, scratching and rubbing myself into a contained frenzy, all the while trying not to disrupt the solemn cremation.”</p>
      <p>The mourners turned and stared at the Caucasian woman shaking and wiggling in some strange ceremonial dance. The mourners, she writes, “must have thought I was one of the weirdest strangers they had ever seen, and that I certainly had an unusual way of paying respect.” Hopping and rubbing, she stumbled back to her driver removed her “damned sarong, screamed ‘F**K’ and scratched away.”</p>
      <p>I caught up with Lea Lane in Miami where she lives:</p>

          <i>Why did you write this travel memoir?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p><i>Lea</i>: A couple of years ago, with the country’s politics getting so dark, I decided to reflect on my travels to over 100 countries, over 50 years, as a way to immerse myself in meaningful, vivid memories. It was a great way to escape, for me as well as the reader.</p>

          <i>The subhead is “Tales, Truths, Delights.” Why these particular words?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Tales are fun to read; some of mine are dark and some really funny. Truths, because besides interesting experiences, I’ve included really personal stuff – I had to warn my family. And as for the last word, I hope the read is delightful.</p>

          <i>How does your book differ from other travel books?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>I guess you can call it a hybrid. It’s a travel memoir, but also a collection of travel essays, a travel almanac, a travel narrative, and an illustrated album of my photos, turned into art. Because of that we’re providing hard copy editions at bookstores, as well as paperback and Kindle on Amazon.</p>

          <i>I really enjoyed not knowing quite what to expect when I turned a page. How did you choose the organization to cover all these countries and all these years?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>I think an A to Z format is easy to follow and makes the countries easy to find. You can read straight through or pick and choose. </p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>The color illustrations are especially beautiful. How were they chosen?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>I took 95 percent of the photos included in the book, all of which relate to the writing. The photos were turned into 70 fine-art illustrations by a brilliant artist, Greg Correll, who had been an illustrator at <i>The New Yorker</i>. I think that they complement the writing in a really stunning way. </p>

          <i>How would you describe the essays?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>There are laugh-out-loud anecdotes and poignant pieces. Some selections focus on a small memory and others on issues that affect us all. I write about people, too: a lady in Cuba who cleans toilets, an unexpected marriage proposal in Malawi, a strange dance with a tribe in the Amazon. It’s a mix.</p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>Who do you see as the reader?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Any adult who travels or wants to. And as I have traveled on my own for much of my life, solo travelers should respond to this book.</p>

          <i>Is there an audiobook besides the print?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>I’m currently recording the audiobook, which will be available by the beginning of 2020. I’m coloring my words to make up for the lack of illustrations. It’s fun. Another kind of journey for me. I’m always up for them.</p>

          <i>Can you sum up your travel philosophy?</i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>Yes. Keep moving!</p>
