      <p>Ireland are currently top of Group A with a total of 13 points from 6 games. However, they do have two games in hand over second-place Iceland and 3 games in hand over Tuesday’s opponents Sweden. Getting a win against this Swedish side will extend Ireland’s lead at the top of Group A.</p>
      <p>Following on from a 1-0 versus Armenia on Thursday in which Ireland were the dominant side and controlled possession, Stephen Kenny’s side will be confident going into the game. </p>

Dara O’Shea will be unavailable after receiving a red card in the 1-0 win over Armenia on Thursday. </p>
      <p>Jayson Molumby and Lee O’Connor are both available to be selected after serving suspensions for the Armenia game.
