      <p>A new Music Walk of Fame launched in London today and honoured its first act by laying down its first paving stone.</p>
      <p>Rock legends The Who are the first music stars to be "immortalised" on the Hollywood Boulevard-style Walk of Fame, which was unveiled today in London's Camden Town (Nov. 19).</p>
      <p>The Music Walk of Fame will stretch along Camden, between live music venue The Roundhouse and popular club Koko. </p>
      <p>Organisers plan to lay more than 400 stones in the next 20 years, with 20 in the works for 2020. Acts including Madness, The Clash, Prince one-time Camden local Amy Winehouse expected to be honoured.</p>
      <p>Visitors will be able to follow the one-metre-square granite plaques along the road and via a new app, which will includes stories and footage of the stars featured.</p>
      <p>In a statement, The Who’s Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend​ said: "We are honoured to be the first band with a stone on the Music Walk Of Fame. Camden has always been vital to London’s thriving music scene and is, as we all know, a world-renowned hub for the arts. As Londoners, it’s very surreal to be immortalised in stone on Camden High Street, and it’s quite something to know that people can pop by and see us anytime, albeit virtually.”</p>
      <p>Music Walk of Fame Founder Lee Bennett added: "What a great day for music, fans, the world, London, and Camden. To cap it off by having one of the greatest bands of all time, I’m thrilled to bits."</p>
      <p>The Who's stone comes as they <a href="https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-who-announce-new-album-who-set-for-release-on-november-22-confirm-2020-uk-arena-tour__27264/">release their first new album in 13 years</a>, called WHO, this Friday (Nov. 22).
