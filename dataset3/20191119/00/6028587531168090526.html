      <p>It’s likely that, advertently or inadvertently, if you have an Instagram account that you follow <a href="https://www.instagram.com/theacademynewyork/?hl=en">THE ACADEMY NEW YORK</a>, like 392K others.The account, which was established by Swaim Hutson is a stylish meeting of fashion, culture and art and we’d expect no less with his modish background (he co-founded Obedient Sons &amp; Daughters and then has later worked in the shadows for various New York labels).</p>
      <p>Hot off the heels of Hutson’s debut ready-to-wear collection which is made up of classically tailored pieces, he offers his New York hotspots.</p>

        <b>Stay: The Bowery Hotel</b>
      </p>
      <p>A very cosy hotel with a great lobby bar. Regardless if you’re from out of town, it’s a good go-to visit for staycations or just meeting friends for a drink.</p>
      <p>Address: 335 Bowery Street, NYC</p>

        <b>Play: Tennis</b>
      </p>
      <p>I don’t get on the court as much as I would like to, but I try to play as much as possible. I grew up a dedicated junior player, so, if I had my choice I would be playing every day.</p>
      <p>Address: At Houston Street, walk over FDR, NYC</p>
      <p>
        <b>Bar: Primo’s</b>
      </p>
      <p>This back room in the lobby of the Frederick Hotel has just the right amount of deco design and dim lighting to compliment any one of their signature cocktails and late-night bites.</p>
      <p>Address: <a href="https://www.primostribeca.com/">129 Chambers Street, NYC</a></p>

        <b>Eat: Le Coucou</b>
      </p>
      <p>Great food; great setting. I would suggest that you get there early (and to make sure you get a reservation!) because the Roman and Williams perfectly designed bar is too beautiful to not enjoy a drink.</p>
      <p>Address: <a href="https://lecoucou.com/">138 Lafayette Street, NYC</a></p>

      <p>
        <b>Eat: Petite Crevette</b>
      </p>
      <p>This is a hidden gem of a restaurant between Cobble Hill and Red Hook. It’s a quirky BYOB seafood eatery in the style of traditional French cooking. My girlfriend Chelsea and I are frequent visitors.</p>
      <p>Address: 144 Union Street, Brooklyn <b>Dance: Public Records</b></p>
      <p>Reminiscent of Berlin in the best of ways! Day or night, this Gowanus record bar, which also features a vegan cafe and cocktail bar, is a great place to hear great sounds. If you’re into rare vinyl collectors and experimental music, their hi-fi sound room is definitely worth checking out. So is their magazine shop.</p>

        <b>Chill out: Lyons Den Power Yoga</b>
      </p>
      <p>My girlfriend Chelsea introduced me to hot yoga at Lyons Den, and now, you can find me in a Vinyasa flow class at least once a week. It is the perfect place to regain balance and sweat out some of that NYC stress.</p>
      <p>Address: <a href="https://lyonsdenpoweryoga.com/">279 Church Street (2nd Floor), NYC</a></p>

        <b>Grooming: Officina Profumo-Farmaceutica di Santa Maria Novella</b>
      </p>
      <p>One of my favorite shops. There’s nothing there that my girlfriend and I haven’t enjoyed, especially their tabacco toscano scented candle. I wear their Alba di Seoul eau de cologne and Chelsea is fond of their Melograno body milk and rose water.</p>

        <b>Culture: Chelsea, NY Art Galleries</b>
      </p>
      <p>Going to visit the galleries every few months is key to reigniting inspiration. I appreciate the mix of discovering new artists alongside rediscovering two of my favorite artists, George Condo who is represented by Skarstedt and Raymond Petitbon, who is represented by David Zwirner.   </p>
      <p>Address: <a href="https://www.skarstedt.com/">Skarstedt 19 East 64th Street</a> &amp; Zwirner 525 West 19th Street</p>

        <b>Landmark: Madison Square Garden</b>
      </p>
      <p>It’s number one in the world for catching a live sporting event or concert. I have seen everything from the Knicks to Oasis. I’ve even attended the Professional Bull Riders at Madison Square Garden.</p>

        <b>Book/magazine store: Kinokuniya USA</b>
      </p>
      <p>My kids and I love to visit the Kinokuniya Japanese bookstore. They have an extensive collection of manga, anime, graphic novels, art and design books. We always grab bubble teas and hand rolls in their second floor cafe, Cafe Zaiya. If I am lucky, they allow me to steal a few minutes to flip through the magazines too.</p>

        <b>Secret place: Red Hook, Brooklyn NY</b>
      </p>
      <p>Nothing is really a secret in NYC, or at least not for long. The Brooklyn neighborhood of Red Hook is a great place to get lost for a few hours and visit a few mom-and-pop shops (<a href="https://chelseagardencenter.com/">Chelsea Garden Center</a> is a great nursery for indoor plants) before grabbing some food at Brooklyn Crab or Red Hook Lobster Pound. If nothing else, the wide open fields and waterside views offer a refreshing spot for a moment of reprieve.</p>

        <b>Most beautiful place: Brooklyn Heights</b>
      </p>
      <p>This is my favorite neighborhood in New York City. Probably due in part to the Royal Tenenbaum-style brownstones and charming narrow sidewalks. There is just a great, wholesome, and familial energy throughout the “first suburb’s” picturesque tree-lined streets. It’s beautiful.</p>

        <b>Your favorite place…: My Morning Run</b>
      </p>
      <p>I’m an avid runner and I am lucky enough to begin each day with a three mile run along the Brooklyn waterfront. There’s no better way to spend one’s morning. It provides me with a daily refresh and clarity of mind. It’s a humbling reminder of just how lucky I am to live in this beautiful city.</p>
