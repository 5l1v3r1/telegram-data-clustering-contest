      <p>Just when you thought blue dials and minimalist designs were taking over the watch universe, the black-and-busy aesthetic that reigned in the late ’90s and early aughts is making a comeback. Vacheron Constantin leads the charge with a new Overseas Dual Time model with a black lacquered dial with white and red highlights. The Overseas is as sporty and “everyday” as it gets from this elite maker that finishes its watches, including this one, to Geneva Hallmark standards. The Overseas, launched in 2017, has come out with blue and silver dials, but the black, says Vacheron, is now being added by popular demand.</p>

      <p>The black lacquer is contrasted by white gold hands and markers, a red-tipped home-time hand and a corresponding smaller red-tipped day/night indicator, synchronized with home time. The distinctive technical feature of the caliber 5110 DT is the simultaneous reading of two time zones, along with the push-piece corrector for the date index at 6 o’clock, synchronized with local time. It has a 22k rotor adorned with a wind rose, and a 60-hour power reserve. Overseas is Vacheron’s series of casual complications, if there is such a thing: everyday watches that include three-hand automatics, chronographs, perpetual calendars, world timers, tourbillons and a dual timer. Vacheron calls them “daily companions.” The Dual Time is priced at $22,900 in steel.</p>

      <p>Speaking of companions, there is a matching ladies’ piece, also with a black lacquer dial and 18k white gold hands and markers, but with a quartz movement and no dual time function. This watch heralds the return of another trend: the matching pair of watches, including a smaller, slightly altered (usually less technical) ladies’ version of a men’s watch. The pairing idea, popular in the 1980s, was scoffed out of the market in favor of “dedicated” ladies’ collections beginning in the late 1990s. One industry wag, for example, commented that making a ladies’ watch as a smaller version of a men’s watch was preposterous, given that “if there is one thing we know for sure about women, it is that they are not just smaller versions of men.” But the pairing is making a comeback (as are quartz watches), partly because of the recognition among women watch lovers that there are a lot of nice men’s watch designs out there – if only they were a little smaller. The quartz movement allows the watch to be more size appropriate. There is a ladies’ three-hand automatic in the Overseas collection, but it is 37 mm, compared to this one’s more wearable 33 mm proportions. The bezel on this one is set with 78 diamonds.</p>

      <p>The ladies’ model is available in three versions: two steel models with black or blue denim dial, and a pink gold model with a silver dial. Both men’s and ladies’ pieces have quick-change strap systems, with options including steel bracelet, leather strap or rubber strap.</p>
