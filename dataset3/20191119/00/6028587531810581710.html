      <h1>Protecting Explainable AI Innovations In Health Care</h1>

      <p>Health care innovators are developing artificial intelligence algorithms called <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikbirkender/2019/10/16/explainable-ai-in-health-care-gaining-context-behind-a-diagnosis/#727f8ccb4bee">Explainable AI (XAI)</a> that actually reveal the logic behind their diagnoses. Because their results can be verified, doctors and regulators will be more likely to adopt these algorithms than traditional “black box” AI. However, the transparency that makes these algorithms valuable to practitioners also makes the technology trickier to protect as intellectual property.</p>

      <p>The very nature of XAI algorithms prevents them from being kept secret, and the law governing patents for diagnostic algorithms is nearly undecipherable. Therefore, a new approach to protecting these innovations will be critical for the people developing them.</p>
      <p>Most companies in the AI space protect their algorithms with trade secrets because they innovate too fast for patents to be worthwhile. They would not be able to detect when competitors were infringing anyway. But in the case of health care, particularly for diagnostics, algorithms must be verified by doctors and regulators—so trade secret protection gets thorny, as at least part of the algorithms must be disclosed. In the case of XAI, which is designed to reveal its methodology so it can “explain” why a diagnosis is given, this challenge gets exacerbated.</p>
      <p>Since trade secrets aren’t an option to fully protect them, companies must develop another way to sufficiently protect their algorithms to justify the cost of clinical trials. As a result, the only option is to patent. Unless the legislature <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/ip-groups-developing-fresh-patent-eligibility-bill-proposal">acts</a>, though, XAI-based diagnostics will continue to be tricky to patent, given that software <i>and </i>diagnostic patent laws continue to evolve. Patenting digital diagnostics can often feel like trying to stand on two ships passing in the sea.</p>
      <p>But with some legal creativity, there are actually multiple paths to patent protection for XAI-based diagnostics. In fact, the combination of software and diagnostics can actually make it easier to patent than technology residing squarely in one of the fields alone; there are patenting opportunities that rely on patent laws originating from both the software <i>and</i> biotech fields.</p>
      <p>First, since many diagnostics require sensors, algorithms can be patented if tied to the use of specific sensors, like pulse oximeters, for example. This is one avenue health care companies typically use to overcome the hurdle for software patentability. In cases where diagnostics don’t require sensors, the patents can be tied to a particular treatment once there is a diagnosis—one of the classic linchpins for patenting in the biotech space. In many cases, having both types of patents will provide better protection than would be available for either software or diagnostics alone.</p>
      <p>Second, the details of algorithms can still be kept as trade secrets. While explainable algorithms provide some justification for their results, the training data and further details can generally be kept secret and even provide a competitive advantage. Trade secret protection, combined with unique patenting strategies, usually provides sufficient protection for XAI diagnostics. Therefore, health care companies would be wise to develop XAI technology aggressively but carefully craft their IP strategy using patents to fully protect these innovations. With these strategies in mind, investment in XAI diagnostics will remain a very viable option.</p>
