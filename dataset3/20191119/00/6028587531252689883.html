      <p>Grammy nominations are slated to be announced later this week, and fans of many well-known artists are holding their breath, hoping to hear the names of their favorite musicians on Wednesday morning. One act that hasn’t been up for a prize yet, but who may finally earn some love this time around, is BTS, and the world is sure to be listening carefully to see if they end up potential winners.There are over 80 categories at the Grammys, but there are four that reign supreme, and many superfans of the K-pop septet are wondering if the band has a shot at ending up in one of the coveted slots.</p>
      <p>Here’s a quick look at which categories BTS has the best shot at snagging a nomination in when it comes to Album, Record and Song of the Year and Best New Artist.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Album of the Year</b>
      </p>
      <p>BTS releases music much faster than most mainstream successes, and in the past eligibility period, they gave fans two full-lengths that could both compete for Album of the Year, though it would understandably be a bad idea for the group to pit their releases against one another. Artists have to submit music to the Recording Academy for potential nomination, so they can choose what they want voters to consider.</p>
      <p>The septet is sure to focus everyone’s attention on <i>Map of the Soul: Persona</i>, their latest No. 1 on the Billboard 200. The set debuted atop the competitive list and has remained one of the most successful releases of 2019, especially when it comes to pure sales. </p>
      <p>BTS’s <i>BTS World</i> soundtrack is also eligible, but since it failed to break into the top 10 and didn’t spin off any major hits, it would be a poor choice if the band went with that option. </p>
      <p>
        <b>Best New Artist</b>
      </p>
      <p>Despite the fact that more and more people are catching on and learning who BTS is every year, they are no longer eligible for Best New Artist, and they haven’t been for some time. The group has both established themselves in a mainstream fashion already, and they’ve released far too much music to be considered “new” any longer. In fact, BTS wasn’t a potential winner last year either.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Record of the Year</b>
      </p>
      <p>Of all the big four prizes, BTS probably has the best shot at being nominated for Record of the Year. They have many tracks that they could submit for consideration, but there is one that will be chosen: “Boy with Luv,” the group’s single with American pop favorite Halsey. The song debuted and peaked at No. 8 on the Hot 100, becoming not only one of the biggest wins of the year, but also BTS’s highest placement and the second-highest-charting K-pop single in U.S. history.</p>
      <p>Grammy voters seem interested in rewarding Halsey for proving herself to be the type of singer who’s going to stick around and produce great work, and aside from her own singles (such as “Without Me,” which will probably also be nominated), they may want to honor her and the K-pop outfit they’ve long ignored in one fell swoop.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Song of the Year</b>
      </p>
      <p>“Boy with Luv” is also eligible for Song of the Year, which honors the songwriters, not the performers...but suggesting that this will happen is truly a stretch. In the 60 years the Grammys have awarded this prize to people who put pen to paper, only one lucky winner was a track performed in a language other than English, and the number of nominees who fit that description can be counted on one hand. Is it impossible? No, but it’s incredibly unlikely that “Boy with Luv” (or any other BTS single, for that matter) earns a nomination in this vertical.</p>
