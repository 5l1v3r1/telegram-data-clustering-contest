        <b>The revamped Davis Cup Finals began with defeats for defending champions Croatia and a talented Italy team.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Croatia’s hopes of defending their Davis Cup title took a huge early blow as they were beaten 3-0 by Russia in Madrid on Monday.</p>
      <p>Champions a year ago, Croatia’s chances of even progressing from the first stage in the 2019 Finals already look remote – with Rafael Nadal’s Spain still to play in Group B.</p>
      <p>Croatia took on Russia on centre court following the opening ceremony in a match-up that was hindered by key withdrawals ahead of the tournament.</p>
      <p>Marin Cilic, who led Croatia to victory in 2018, missed out with injury, while Russia’s Daniil Medvedev ducked out citing fatigue.</p>
      <p>Russia dealt with the absence of their number one in far more convincing fashion than Croatia, though, with Borna Gojo comfortably eased out 6-3 6-3 by Andrey Rublev in the first of three contests.</p>
      <p>The two remaining star names did battle next, but Russia again came out on top as Karen Khachanov rallied past Borna Coric 6-7 (4-7) 6-4 6-4.</p>
      <p>And then Rublev and Khachanov teamed up for a straight-sets doubles success against Ivan Dodig and Nikola Mektic.</p>

      <p>Elsewhere, there was an upset as Italy went down to Canada 2-1, with both Fabio Fognini and Matteo Berrettini beaten in singles play.</p>
      <p>Vasek Pospisil, ranked 150th in the world, defeated Khachanov at the US Open and claimed another scalp against Fognini, before Berrettini was turned over by Denis Shapovalov.</p>
      <p>Italy sent in their two stars for the doubles, where they gained a measure of revenge over Pospisil and Shapovalov, winning in three.</p>
      <p>Belgium survived David Goffin’s awful start to his rubber to win 2-1 against Colombia.</p>
      <p>Steve Darcis had earlier seen off Santiago Giraldo in straight sets, but Goffin fell four games behind in the opener against Daniel Elahi Galan before staging a fightback.</p>
      <p>He won 3-6 6-3 6-3, although Colombia got on the board with a doubles comeback from Juan-Sebastian Cabal and Robert Farah.</p>
