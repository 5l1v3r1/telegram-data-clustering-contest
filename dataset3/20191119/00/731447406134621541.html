      <p>Yasiin Bey's new album <i>Negus</i> was coproduced by London artists <a href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/lordtusk">Lord Tusk</a> and Steven Julien, AKA <a href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/funkineven">FunkinEven</a>. <br/><br/>The album from the US rapper, famously known as Mos Def, originally premiered back in April at Art Basel Hong Kong. It can now be heard in person at the Brooklyn Museum until January 26th. The LP will not be released in digital or analog formats and listeners will need to lock their phones in <a href="https://www.overyondr.com/howitworks">Yondr pouches</a> upon entering the gallery. They can then listen to the eight-track, 28-minute album on headphones. <br/><br/>The Brooklyn premiere marks the 20th anniversary of bey's seminal album, <i>Black On Both Sides</i>. Lord Tusk was on hand to DJ a premiere party this past weekend. In a tweet from April, Apron Records head Julien noted the album was recorded in London in 2015 with further production assistance from Acyde. <br/><br/>Check out the near-complete tracklist in the post below.</p>
