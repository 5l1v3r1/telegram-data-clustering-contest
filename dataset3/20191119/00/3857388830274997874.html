        <b>Washington,</b>
      </p>
      <p>Donald Trump's doctor issued a report Monday on the US president's health after a "routine, planned" check-up, saying that contrary to some reports he had not suffered any chest pain.</p>
      <p>Trump, 73, spent just over an hour on Saturday having "examinations, labs and discussions" at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Washington, presidential physician Sean Conley said in a statement issued by the White House.</p>
      <p>"Despite some of the speculation, the President has not had any chest pain, nor was he evaluated or treated for any urgent or acute issues," Conley said.<br/>"Specifically, he did not undergo any specialised cardiac or neurologic evaluations."</p>
      <p>Some Washington reports suggested that the check-up was unscheduled and had been triggered by Trump suffering chest discomfort.</p>
      <p>"Due to scheduling uncertainties, the trip was kept off the record," Conley said in the statement, which added details of the president's cholesterol results.</p>

        <b>PENCHANT FOR JUNK FOOD</b>
      </p>
      <p>At Trump's last routine examination in February, Conley declared him to be in "very good health."</p>
      <p>Trump, who has confounded health experts with his penchant for junk food and avoidance of strenuous exercise, weighed 243 pounds (110 kg) at that time.</p>
      <p>White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham on Saturday said Trump took advantage of a free weekend to complete portions of his annual physical before "a very busy 2020" when he faces a tough re-election race.</p>
      <p>In 2018, Trump's then-chief physician, Ronny Jackson, held an unusually detailed press conference in which he declared Trump to have "incredibly good genes."</p>
      <p>Soon afterwards, Trump appointed him to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs, before Jackson withdrew his name from consideration.</p>
