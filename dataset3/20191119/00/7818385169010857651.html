      <p>Troubled coworking space company WeWork is now under <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-wework-newyork-investigation-exclusiv/exclusive-new-york-state-attorney-general-investigating-wework-sources-idUSKBN1XT01J?il=0&amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_medium=Social">investigation</a> by the New York State Attorney General (NYAG), Reuters reported Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The report comes just days after Bloomberg <a href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3773835,00.html">reported</a> that the company is facing a preliminary U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation into possible violations regarding its failed attempt to go public in September.</p>

      <p>Among the focuses of the NYAG investigation are allegations that co-founder and former CEO Adam Neumann benefitted from self-dealing.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, the New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/17/business/wework-layoffs.html">reported</a> that WeWork intends to fire at least 4,000 people as part of its recuperation plans, following the <a href="https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3773726,00.html">turmoil</a> it has undergone in recent months after its plans to go public crumbled down in September.</p>
