      <p>With all the manufactured excitement over U.S.-China progress and oil bulls’ fantasy over where <a href="https://www.investing.com/commodities/crude-oil">crude prices</a> could go, it’s a little easy to lose sight sometimes of the commodities that should really be toasted for their performance.</p>
      <p>One of them is coffee.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.investing.com/commodities/us-coffee-c">Arabica coffee</a> on ICE Futures U.S. is trading not far from four-month highs hit almost two weeks ago—and trade expectations are enough to keep it steaming for a while.</p>
      <p>Arabica is up 7% on both the year and the month—in fact the second month in three where it’s risen as much.</p>
      <p>At Monday’s settlement of $1.092 for a lb, benchmark arabica for March delivery is just slightly adrift from July highs of $1.099 reached on Nov. 8.</p>
      <p>Jack Scoville, veteran coffee analyst at Chicago’s Price Futures Group, thinks $1.11 will be a good resistance to test for benchmark arabica.</p>
      <h3>Arabica, Robusta Both On The Uptrend</h3>
      <p>And it’s not just arabica that’s winning the “softs” crowd—a commodities monicker for the followers of coffee, <a href="https://www.investing.com/commodities/us-cocoa">cocoa</a>, <a href="https://www.investing.com/commodities/us-sugar-no11">sugar</a> and <a href="https://www.investing.com/commodities/orange-juice">orange juice</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.investing.com/commodities/london-coffee">Robusta coffee</a> on U.K.’s Liffe is also trying to recover from a poor patch through most of this year, rising more than 5% so far in November.</p>
      <p>At $1,364 per tonne, robusta for January delivery hasn’t strayed too much either from Thursday’s four-month high of $1,441.00. Scoville puts first resistance at $1,460, following which, he says, it could get to $1,480.</p>
      <p>So, what’s brewing with coffee?</p>
      <h3>Dry Weather In Brazil</h3>
      <p>In arabica’s case, it’s a dry spell in top grower Brazil, where rain itself has become a bit of a prized commodity.</p>
      <p>Says Mike Seery, who discerns commodity trends for his Seery Futures forecasting agency in Plainfield, Illinois:</p>
      <blockquote>“Major concerns about drought developing in Brazil have pushed arabica prices off of a 14-year low.”</blockquote>
      <blockquote>“If the hot and dry weather conditions persist, I would think prices could touch the contract high hit on July 5 at $1.19. But at this point, the volatility should start to increase as the market can have tremendous price swings daily.”</blockquote>
      <p>Investing.com’s Daily Technical Outlook rates arabica as a “Strong Buy”, predicting a top-end resistance of $1.098 per lb.</p>
      <p>It also notes that arabica has smashed past most price barriers set in recent days, and is now trading above its 200-Day Moving Average.</p>
      <p>Scoville largely concurs with the weather-impact laid out by Seery on arabica:</p>
      <blockquote>“The Brazilian crop is developing but some exporters say they are out of previous crop supplies to sell.”</blockquote>
      <blockquote>“Reports from Brazil indicate that flowering is off to a very good start. Rains are expected again in coffee areas this week. Overall, the coffee areas remain in a rain deficit but have had some timely rains to start the flowering season.”</blockquote>
      <h3>Sellers’ Reserve In Vietnam</h3>
      <p>As for robusta, he said production had slowed from top grower Vietnam, which appeared to be resisting lowly offers from some buyers.</p>
      <p>Says Scoville:</p>
      <blockquote>“The Asian harvest is underway but producers do not seem to be selling on ideas that prices are too low to provide profits. Vietnam exports remain behind a year ago. But the market anticipates bigger offers as producers and traders will need to create new storage space and are expected to do this by selling old crop coffee.”</blockquote>
      <blockquote>“Vietnam crops are thought to be big despite some uneven growing conditions this year. A tropical system hit production areas in the last couple of weeks and so far there have been reports of some damage and losses.”</blockquote>
      <p>Investing.com’s Daily Technical Outlook rates robusta as a “Strong Buy” from a “Sell” a month ago, predicting a top-end resistance of $1,447.66 for the January contract—a generous climb of $83, or 6%, from current levels.</p>
