      <p>After being served a couple of diet cokes (ever the professionals), a furious regular in the pub accused Mr Cruise of stealing a pack of cigarettes and swung at him with his walking stick.</p>
      <p>Healy-Rae explained how the Hollywood duo entered the pub one afternoon, wearing jeans and sunglasses, but otherwise going unrecognised.</p>
      <p>"There was a man sitting down the end of the counter called Ger the Manny," he said.</p>
      <p>"He was an elderly man and he had his stick up on the counter and he was sipping away at a little glass of Guinness."</p>
      <p>The bartender working that day, called Matt, served the young couple two glasses of diet coke with ice, before heading into a backroom briefly.</p>
      <p>Healy-Rae continued: "When he was gone, the Yank leaned behind the counter and he had his hand dipped inside the counter.</p>

      <p>"Ger jumped up off his stool, he caught his stick and drew a belt at yer man’s hand trying to hit him across the hand.</p>
      <p>"But he just missed and there was a big bang down on the counter right near the Yank’s hand."</p>
      <p>After hearing the bang, Matt rushed back to the bar, where Cruise apparently told him: "My goodness, I was just leaning in to get a bit more ice."</p>
      <p>But Ger the Manny wasn't convinced and disputed Cruise's claims of innocence, shouting: "You bastard, you were trying to steal Matt's fags!"</p>
      <p>But the actor supposedly stuck to his story, according to Healy-Rae: "The Yank looked at them and said, 'I was not, I was trying to steal nothing.' They sipped away at their Diet Coke and left."</p>
      <p>He added: "If Ger had been an inch or two longer he could have broke [his] arm."</p>
