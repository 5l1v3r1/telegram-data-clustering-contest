        <b>THE traditional music scene in Ireland is fantastic at the moment, according to fiddler John Carty.</b>
      </p>
      <p>“The market is well-flooded with great players”, he admits, but a result though, it’s getting harder to make a living out of it, meaning that many great Irish musicians are taking their instruments overseas where there is popular uptake.</p>
      <p>“It’s always been the way,” the musician explains.</p>
      <p>“I was in Japan this year. I did about ten days.”</p>
      <p>Who knew that traditional Irish music has an audience in Japan, but Carty insists. And they don’t just listen to Irish music, they play too!</p>
      <p>“There’s a big scene there,” says Carty.</p>
      <p>“People have been visiting Japan now for over 20 years I would say, with good Irish music, so they can really play.”</p>
      <p>“You might not be able to talk to them in Japanese but you can sit down and play tunes all afternoon together, it’s amazing.”</p>
      <p>He adds: “I went into a bar there - the finest of Irish traditional music playing, and this guy he showed me my own CD’s that I have made. Then he took out the fiddle and played me a tune.</p>
      <p>“And he was no slouch, he was a lovely player. We played tunes and drank sake.”</p>
      <p>So, the international language of Irish music is truly alive and well!</p>
      <p>Born to Irish parents in East London, Carty grew up listening to Irish music and going to trad sessions.</p>
      <p>His father, also John Carty, from Boyle, Co. Roscommon, was a member of the Glenside Ceili Band in London in the 1960’s.</p>
      <p>Carty remembers the excitement of going along to traditional Irish music sessions as a child in The White Hart in Fulham Broadway.</p>
      <p>“You’d walk down this long corridor which was wood panelled and when you get to the end of it this world opened up,” he recalls.</p>
      <p>“Top class Irish music, the whole place was just bustling.</p>
      <p>“I’m sure there’s the likes of jazz dens in New York that were kind of similar, but this was really great traditional Irish music.”</p>
      <p>There would be great musicians playing, such as the likes of Roger Sherlock, Raymond Roland and many others.</p>
      <p>Carty picked up the fiddle himself when he was around ten or eleven, under the tutelage of famed Irish traditional music teacher Brendan Mulkere, and hasn’t looked back since.</p>
      <p>He now lives in Boyle, Co. Roscommon with his wife Maureen - the “backbone” of the family - and was awarded TG4’s Traditional Musician of the Year in 2003.</p>
      <p>He is currently the Sligo Traditional Artist in Residence and also teaches in the University of Limerick once a week - it was a former student of his who invited him out to that memorable trip in Japan.</p>
      <p>This week he’ll be playing the Blásta Music Festival in London for the first time, alongside Matt Molloy, the legendary flute player from The Chieftains and Brian McGrath on keyboard.</p>
      <p>Music very much runs in the next generation of the Carty family too.</p>
      <p>His son, James Carty, has released a debut solo album, Hiding Daylight in Dark Corners, which features John Carty on flute and fiddle.</p>
      <p>It is his second collaboration with one of his children, after the release of Settle Out Of Court, a duet album with his daughter Maggie Carty in 2016.</p>
      <p>There are not many other bucket list items to tick off for Carty, except for perhaps a holiday. But it wouldn’t be a holiday without the fiddle.</p>
      <p>“One of the greatest trips I have ever had was cycling around Ireland with my brother and a few of us. And we’d bring the instruments,” says Carty.</p>
      <p>“Anything like that. I would love to do trips like that. Just tear off, throwing a fiddle on my shoulder.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Blásta Music Festival runs from November 9-30 at the Irish Cultural Centre, Hammersmith. Matt Molloy, John Carty and Brian McGrath perform within the festival on November 22. For tickets <a href="https://irishculturalcentre.co.uk/">click here</a>.</b>
