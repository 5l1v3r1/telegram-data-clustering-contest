      <p>Today is international men’s day. This is an opportunity to shed light on issues faced by men that typically lie in the shadows of society. One of these issues is Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) against men.</p>
      <p>The popular image of IPV is based on the familiar <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/gender">gender</a> stereotype of a male villain and a female victim. But that stereotype paints an incomplete picture, with new research indicating a high number of male victims of domestic abuse.</p>
      <h4>Research on Domestic Violence</h4>
      <p>A recent UK government <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/datasets/domesticabusefindingsfromthecrimesurveyforenglandandwalesappendixtables">survey</a> indicated that 9% of males had experienced some form of partner abuse, which amounts to around 1.4 million men. This includes stalking, physical violence and sexual assault. Indeed, a seminal US <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Denise_Hines/publication/225632595_Characteristics_of_Callers_to_the_Domestic_Abuse_Helpline_for_Men/links/09e4150ab825d0a40c000000/Characteristics-of-Callers-to-the-Domestic-Abuse-Helpline-for-Men.pdf">study</a> found that male IPV victims are often slapped, kicked, punched, grabbed or choked by their partners.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, a growing body of <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.372.6102&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">international research</a> indicates that men and women experience IPV in similar proportions. For example, a recent <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/85-002-x/2016001/article/14303-eng.pdf">survey </a>from Canada’s national statistical agency concluded that “equal proportions of men and women reported being victims of spousal violence during the preceding 5 years (4% respectively).”</p>
      <p>The aforementioned surveys indicate that small proportions of men (less than 20% of victims) will tell the police or a health professional about their victimization. This may be due to well-grounded fears that they will be scorned, ridiculed, or disbelieved by these authorities.</p>
      <p>Indeed, a recent <a href="http://insight.cumbria.ac.uk/id/eprint/4367/1/Impact%20and%20perceptions%20paper%20final.pdf">research paper</a> by Dr. Elizabeth Bates from the University of Cumbria found that the overarching experience of male IPV victims was that "no one would ever believe me." One victim noted "I told friends, they laughed while another stated … the police, they laughed."</p>
      <p>Incredulously, laughter is a common response to male victims of IPV. This is illustrated in the short "social experiment" video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3PgH86OyEM">here</a>, examining public reactions to a male being abused by a female on a street. This video has over 8 million views on YouTube and is a powerful educational tool.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Mankind Initiative</b>
      </p>
      <p>The above video was created by the <a href="https://www.mankind.org.uk/">Mankind Initiative</a>, a leading British charity supporting male victims of domestic abuse. Led by the indefatigable Mark Brooks OBE, the Mankind Initiative held its <a href="https://www.mankind.org.uk/conference/">national conference</a> on male victims of domestic abuse last week, which I attended.</p>
      <p>This event attracted around 100 people. Attendees heard a range of engaging presentations from researchers, service-providers and IPV victims. The presentations overlapped with the research literature, with IPV victim Tim noting how the police and others tended to dismiss his story.</p>
      <p>Likewise, Dr. Nicola Graham-Kevan from the University of Central Lancashire reported her <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-04384-1_7">latest research</a> indicating that male IPV victims are often pathologized, and sometimes regarded with suspicion by the very agencies that should be helping them.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, there was a palpable air of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/optimism">optimism</a> pervading the event. The conference was attended by a variety of senior figures including police officers, health care providers, lawyers, community workers, military representatives, and local government employees. This indicates a growing awareness of the seriousness of the issue among key stakeholders.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the conference heard how the mainstream media is starting to take this issue seriously. For example, the BBC produced a poignant <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p0700912">documentary</a> earlier this year entitled "abused by my girlfriend." A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_dr9y41J38">short-version</a> has received over 5 million views on YouTube.</p>
      <p>This documentary reports the painful story of 22-year-old Alex Skeel, who was repeatedly knifed, scolded, and hammered by his then-girlfriend. The police supported Alex throughout his ordeal, and his ex-girlfriend recently received a 7-year prison sentence.</p>
      <p>All this may reflect a turning of the tide, at least with regards to growing public awareness and increased media interest in IPV against men.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Way Ahead</b>
      </p>
      <p>The momentum must be maintained to further prevent and address IPV against men. Three discrete actions could assist in this regard.</p>
      <p>First, official service provision for male victims of IPV remains scant. Indeed, a recent <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/85-002-x/2015001/article/14207-eng.htm">government report</a> noted that there were 627 shelters for abused women in Canada, but only 6% of these admitted men, with zero shelters solely for men. In the UK, it has been <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-45490173">reported</a> that only around 1% of refuge beds are reserved for men. This demands more provision for male victims, without detracting from current provision for female victims.</p>
      <p>Second, there is a pressing need for <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/education">education</a> and training in these issues for key stakeholders including the police, health-care providers, and the judiciary. Such efforts should enlighten stakeholders about the realities of IPV against men, while challenging gendered stereotypes built on the false dichotomy of a male villain and a female victim.</p>
      <p>Third, there is an acknowledged need for interventions aimed at women who abuse men. Indeed, the British charity Respect <a href="http://respectphoneline.org.uk/help-information/domestic-violence-prevention-programmes/">notes that</a> "Most <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/domestic-violence">domestic violence</a> perpetrator programmes have been designed for men in heterosexual relationships." More research and action should focus on developing, validating and disseminating prevention programs aimed at female domestic abusers.</p>
      <p>Domestic violence against men is no <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/laughter">laughing</a> matter. It is a deadly serious issue in need of concerted action. Let’s hope the tide begins to turn.</p>

      </h4>
      <p>Submitted by ben on November 19, 2019 - 9:47am</p>
      <p>It's even worse. Law enforcement, lawyers, judge's are all trailed to follow the duluth model. The duluth model dictates that the primary aggressor must be removed from the home in any domestic violence reporting. This sounds like the person instigating the violence right? Wrong! The duluth model has a totally different definition of primary aggressor. The duluth model dictates that the assumed physically stronger party should be considered the primary aggressor. This will almost always be the man. So even if the man calls the police because he's the victim, he'll be the one arrested and probably hit with a restraining order. This means he has now left the marital home and the woman gets the children (if they have any). This has huge consequences for any possible divorce case. The victim is punished, stripped of his rights, robbed of his home and money, and worst of all alienated from his children. While often still forced to pay ridiculous amounts of money to his abuser. And he will go to jail if he can't.</p>

      <p>Thank you, Dr. Whitley. I appreciate your good work. You are one of the very few bloggers on this site that discusses men's issues.</p>
      <p>In the USA, there is only the Violence Against Women Act, which violates the Equal Protection rights of men. As Ben stated, it was based on the fraudulent Duluth model. Men's groups tried to present the evidence of equal perpetration of DV during VAWA public hearings, but Joseph Biden wouldn't allow them to do so.</p>

      <p>My mother didn't physically assault my father, but she did emotionally. She knew that my dad would never hit her and she used that knowledge to manipulate him. I don't know how he stayed with her. When he was dying of cancer, I found out that she was pushing and hitting him. Had I known, I would have called the authorities. I still don't know why my sisters, knowing this didn't do anything.<br/>I wasn't allowed to visit my dad since I was shunned from the family by my mother.<br/>I'm glad there is more attention called to this problem.</p>

      <p>Brave article. Glad to see it.</p>
      <p>Two articles illustrate women's unprovoked violence:</p>
      <p>"Why This Is a Very Scary Time for Young Men" At MindingTheCampus</p>
      <p>"Women Caught on Video Abusing Children" at Male Matters USA</p>
      <p>If women abuse and violently attack small, innocent children, what are they capable of doing to men, whom they've been told almost daily by feminists, directly or indirectly, to hate?</p>
