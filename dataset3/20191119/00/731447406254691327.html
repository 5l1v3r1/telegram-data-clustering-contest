      <p>Grimes fans can breathe a sigh of relief—for now. After a tumultuous period of scrutiny around her personal life and some nu-metal leaning singles, she's announced the full details of her upcoming album, <a href="https://www.residentadvisor.net/news/71082"><i>Miss_Anthrop0cene</i></a>. The opener, "So Heavy I Fell Through The Earth," is fantastic. The LP's concept is about the personification of climate change, and the first track's title the might hint at environmental themes. That said, it's still a gorgeous, trip-hop influenced love song. <br/><br/>The stunning track combines the <i>Ray Of Light</i>-style production of <i>Art Angels</i> with the vocal styles of <i>Visions</i> (particularly its heart-rending closer, "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R00Vu7Ag7s">Skin</a>"). There are only a few lyrics, but Grimes' soaring vocals sell it like only she can. It's a welcome return to what Grimes does best. If the rest of <i>Miss_Anthrop0cene</i> matches up, it could be her best record yet.</p>
