      <p><b>Update (11/18/2019 - 4:00PM PT)</b><b>:</b> Valve has confirmed that <a href="https://twitter.com/valvesoftware/status/1196566870360387584?s=20">Half-Life: Alyx is indeed real</a>. Contrary to previous rumors that Valve would reveal the VR game at The Game Awards, Valve is instead getting ready to show Half-Life: Alyx off on Thursday November 21, 2019 at 10AM PT / 1PM ET. Stay tuned for more information as we eagerly await the full reveal of a new entry in the Half-Life series.</p>

      <p><b>Original Story: </b>It’s been a little bit since we’ve had a new wild goose to chase when it comes to the continuation of the Half-Life series, but a new interview transcript leak could be bringing new life back to the discussion. According to the leak, Valve could be making Half-Life: Alyx, a VR game, and it could be revealed at The Game Awards.</p>
      <p>The rumor first began on November 17, 2019 with a <a href="https://pastebin.com/9rjrw8nC">leaked interview transcript</a> that was reportedly discovered by the same source that posted leaks for <a href="https://www.shacknews.com/topic/dota-underlords">DOTA Underlords</a>. The script alleges a conversation between a “Geoff” (thought to be Geoff Keighley), Valve Developer Robin Walker (Team Fortress 2), and an unnamed third party. In the conversation, the game title “Half-Life: Alyx” is mentioned, as well as pointing to the fact that it will likely be a VR-only title with a launch window of March 2020.</p>

      <p>“Yeah, I mean we would love to be delivering a version of this that you could play with a mouse and a keyboard,” the script states. “But like as we said, it began as an exploration of VR.”</p>
      <p>PC Gamer followed these rumors <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/rumour-valve-are-about-to-announce-a-vr-game-called-half-life-alyx/">with claims</a> that a new leaked transcript stated the supposed Half-Life: Alyx game would be revealed at The Video Game Awards on December 12, but the linked interview has <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1T7Dke__WLzyTzDg1omSrSzy5alzbUhsC8kZZ8anAhqk/edit">since been deleted</a>, so facts are still rather cloudy on the matter. Even so, it’s worth noting that Valve announced they would be launching a <a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/111489/valve-to-release-flagship-vr-game-later-this-year-on-steamvr">flagship VR title</a> back in April, though if the leaked transcript is to be believed, that would put Half-Life: Alyx outside Valve’s expectation to launch their VR game in 2019.</p>
      <p>We’ll follow this story as more information becomes available. What do you think of a VR Half-Life game? Would it be an appropriate return to the Half-Life series or is this simply another pipe dream? Let us know in the Shacknews Chatty comment section below!</p>
