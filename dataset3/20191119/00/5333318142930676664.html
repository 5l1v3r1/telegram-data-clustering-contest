      <h1>Renewable energy investment hot spots</h1>

      <p>When it comes to attracting renewable energy investment, Europe has five countries ranked in the top 10. That’s according to the 54<sup>th</sup> EY Renewable energy country attractiveness index (<a href="https://www.ey.com/en_uk/power-utilities/renewable-energy-country-attractiveness-index">RECAI</a>).</p>
      <p>France (4th), Germany (6th), UK (7th), Denmark (9th), The Netherlands (10th), lead the way for Europe, with notable rises this year in the index from Ireland, up five place to 18, and Poland up from 43 to 34. A strong performance from Spain’s solar market helped it to 15th on the list, while China and the US remain one and two respectively.</p>
      <blockquote>“Achieving net zero emissions is challenging, but attainable, if we start now. It is a goal that four of the world’s countries have passed legislation to achieve by 2050, with over 60 more actively considering it. This presents a transformative opportunity for the energy industry. It is time to shed the stereotype of being slow to change, show strong leadership and take strong action on multiple fronts – including deploying new technologies, investing in energy efficiency and advocating for carbon pricing,” said Benoit Laclau, EY Global Energy Leader.</blockquote>
