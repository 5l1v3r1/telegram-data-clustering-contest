      <p><b>Monrovia –</b> Leaders of the group, Liberians in Support for Democratic Change (LSDC) continue to come under staunch criticisms from the ruling Coalition for Democratic Change (CDC).</p>
      <p>The LSDC is being headed by two top stalwarts of the CDC including Jemima Wolokolie, Deputy Minister of Commerce and Rebecca McGill, sister of the Minister of State for Presidential Affairs, Nathaniel McGill.</p>
      <p>The group is being accused of falsely claiming to be a CDC Auxiliary and has launched a loan scheme in the name of the CDC and collecting fees for citizens with the promise of giving them a loan.</p>
      <p>This prompted the Executive Council of the CDC to distance itself from the LSDC’s scheme, terming the group’s action as “contemptible, misguided and insensitive to the realities of the challenges we strive to overcome.”</p>
      <p>Another group within the party, under the banner Council of County Chairpersons of Congress for Democratic Change, has joined in with its condemnations.</p>

      <p>The group, comprising members of the 15 political subdivision in a release said its attention has been drawn to recent comments made by the Deputy Minister of Commerce, Madam Jemima Wolokolie and posted on her Facebook page on November 17, 2019 that the decision by the group was sanctioned by higher-ups of the party.</p>
      <p>“The Council of County Chairpersons view this development as troubling as it undermines the party’s cohesiveness, credibility and brings unwarranted distraction in the CDC-led government’s efforts to remain focus in serving the interests of its people,” the statement said.  </p>
      <p>“In view of these unfortunate events which have brought the party to the media for the wrong reasons, the Council is requesting immediate dissolution of the so-called LSDC leadership pending the appropriate granting of auxiliary status by the party, and the immediate suspension of Madam Wolokolie in keeping with the by-laws and constitution of the Congress for Democratic Change.”</p>
      <p>The Council in the release said in its extraordinary session has resolved to watch out in the various counties for unauthorized individuals that would dare impersonate in the name of the party while soliciting money from the already suffering masses. </p>
      <p>“The Council of County Chairpersons announces that it stands by the decision of the National Executive Committee in distancing the party from unauthorized and unethical activities allegedly being conducted by Minister Jemima Wolokolie,” the statement said.</p>
