      <h1>California sues Juul for allegedly selling, marketing to minors</h1>

      <p>Nov. 18 (UPI) -- California filed a lawsuit Monday alleging that e-cigarette maker <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Juul/?tps=1">Juul</a> failed to properly vet online customers, allowing the products to be shipped to minors.</p>
      <p>The<a href="https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/attachments/press-docs/91186258.pdf"> lawsuit alleges</a> that Juul illegally marketed and sold its e-cigarettes to minors through a flaw in the age verification system for its online store that resulted in "hundreds of thousands of tobacco products to be sold and/or delivered" to customers in California with made-up names and non-existent addresses.</p>
      <p>"Juul adopted the tobacco industry's infamous playbook, employing advertisements that had no regard for public health and searching out vulnerable targets," California Attorney General <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Xavier_Becerra/?tps=1">Xavier Becerra</a> said during a press conference on Monday. "Today we take legal action against the deceptive practices that Juul and the e-cigarette industry employ to lure our kids into their vaping web."</p>
      <p>The lawsuit cites email correspondence between Juul and the company's age verification vendor, Veratad, in which Juul compliance manager Annie Kennedy asked Veratad employee Tom Canfarotta why a customer was age verified despite listing an incorrect address.</p>
      <p>"Your current ruleset does not require a full address match," Canfarotta responded.</p>
      <p>The suit alleges that Juul was aware the Veratad verification process did not always analyze a potential customer's name, full address and date of birth when confirming their identity and age, resulting in approval of accounts with "bad info" being approved.</p>
      <p>However, it cites an email by senior business systems manager Adam Bower, in which he wrote "if veratad passed it [then] it's not on us."</p>
      <p>Additionally, California alleges that Juul stored the personal e-mails of minors who attempted and failed to purchase vaping products and proceeded to market to them.</p>
      <p>The lawsuit seeks to court to order Juul to pay for the cost of addiction treatment and prevention as well as $2,500 per violation of the state's false advertising and unfair competition laws.</p>
