      <h1>New CS: GO Operation, Shattered Web, Released by Valve</h1>

      <p>It seems as if Valve has really woken up as at roughly 02:00 SAST, the developer not only announced a new Half-Life game called Half-Life: Alyx and at roughly the same time, the developer also released the first new CS: GO Operation in two years, called Operation Shattered Web.</p>
      <p><b>RELATED:</b> <a href="https://www.glitched.africa/half-life-alyx-officially-confirmed-valve-will-reveal-it-this-week/">Half-Life: Alyx Officially Announced – Valve Will Unveil it This Week</a></p>
      <p>CS: GO Operation Shattered Web will set you $15 (roughly R240) which is quite a bit more than the previous CS: GO Operation which only cost $6. For the first time ever, players will be able to unlock all-new T and CT-sided characters with their own unique looks, voice lines and more.</p>
      <p>This all comes in the form of a new battle pass format for CS: GO Operation Shattered Web, with which players will be able to unlock all-new weapon collections, stickers, graffiti and more. There are new cases, from the Shattered Web case to the Norse Collection to the Canals Collection and more. Furthermore, there’s an upgradeable coin for the new CS: GO Operation, as is the tradition.</p>
      <blockquote>Operation Shattered Web features CS: GO’s first ‘agents,’ characters that can be equipped on the T or CT side. In addition to their unique look, Master Agents have special voice lines and animations–you’ll get one Master Agent when you earn your final reward. Along the way, you’ll earn several Operation Shattered Web Weapon Cases, along with weapons from three brand new weapons collections featuring designs from community artists. You’ll also earn all-new graffiti and community-designed stickers!<br/><br/> <br/><br/>Each week, you’ll get access to new missions in various CS: GO game modes, including cooperative Guardian missions and an all-new Strike mission. Missions are available to all players, but you’ll need an Operation Pass to redeem your rewards. You may recall that we recently shipped a few changes to bots in Deathmatch. Those bots will be ready for action in the Guardian and Strike missions, so watch out!</blockquote>
      <p>If that’s not all, there’s also some new maps and Accolades, which are special call-outs at the end-of-match screen.</p>
      <p>You can check out all the details including all the cosmetic items from the various cases for the new CS: GO Operation, Shattered Web, from the <a href="http://counter-strike.net/shatteredweb">official mini-site from Valve</a>.</p>
