        <b>Brazil opened the scoring after just nine minutes against South Korea, with a good header from Paqueta. Coutinho then made it two thanks to a great free-kick which went into the top corner.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In the first half of the encounter between Brazil and South Korea, <b>Brazil showed their quality and attacking threat </b>against a South Korean side who could not hit on the target. Alisson had next to nothing to do early on. </p>
      <p>After just nine minutes of the fame, <a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/p-coutinho-65113">Coutinho</a>, <b>with the ball at his boots</b>, cut inside the box, laid it off for Renan Lodi with a pass with the inside of his foot and<b> </b><a href="https://www.besoccer.com/player/l-paqueta-318372/">Paqueta</a> <b>headed his cross brilliantly past goalkeeper </b>Cho Hyun-Woo. </p>

      <p>Before the end of the first half, <b>Bayern's Philippe Coutinho hit a lovely free-kick </b>to double Brazil's lead. </p>
      <p>The 27 year-old striker placed the ball near the corner of the Korean box and he hit a sweet strike with his right foot in the top left hand corner of the goal. <b>It was an absolute stunner by Coutinho</b>.</p>
