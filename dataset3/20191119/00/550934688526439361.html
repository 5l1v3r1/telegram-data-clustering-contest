          <figcaption>Legendary art temple: Spain's Museo del Prado turns 200<br/><b>Inaugurated in 1819 <br/></b>Without a doubt, the Prado is one of the most famous museums in the world — and one of the most visited. On November 19, 1819, this art institution was inaugurated under the name "Museo Real de Pintura y Escultura" (Royal Museum of Painting and Sculpture). Works from the 19th and 20th centuries departed from the museum in 1971, and today the museum is primarily a home to the great Old Masters.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>Legendary art temple: Spain's Museo del Prado turns 200<br/><b>Goya's "Nude Maja"<br/></b>Spanish art was naturally the focus of attention from the very beginning. Goya's painting "La Maja desnuda" was painted between 1795 and 1800 and was considered scandalous. The Spanish Inquisition took Goya to task and asked him about his clients. His answer remains unknown, but his title as Royal Court Painter was revoked. Today, the painting is a magnet among Prado-goers.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>Legendary art temple: Spain's Museo del Prado turns 200<br/><b>Velázquez' paintings of the Royal Family<br/></b>Several works by Goya's compatriot Diego Rodriguez de Silva y Velázquez are also housed in the Prado. The most important and famous is "Las Meninas" ("The Maids of Honor," with an excerpt shown here). The painting, which was created in 1656, went down in art history because it reflected the act of painting itself. Velázquez himself can be seen on the left with a brush.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>Legendary art temple: Spain's Museo del Prado turns 200<br/><b>Dürer's nudes<br/></b>Today, the Prado's collection includes thousands of pictures. The Spanish focus was expanded, bringing in pictures from the Netherlands, Italy, France, England, and the German-speaking region. One of the most famous is Albrecht Dürer's "Adam and Eve" (1507), painted on wood panels, and shown here after an elaborate restoration.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>Legendary art temple: Spain's Museo del Prado turns 200<br/><b>Botticelli's early Renaissance visions<br/></b>A showpiece of Italian painting exhibited at the Prado is Sandro Botticelli's "Story of Nastagio Degli Onesti" (with an excerpt shown here). The scene refers to an episode in 14th-century Italian author Giovanni Boccaccio's "The Decameron" and shows a gruesome picture in which a woman is hunted by dogs and men. The painting was painted at the end of the 15th century.</figcaption>

          <figcaption>Legendary art temple: Spain's Museo del Prado turns 200<br/><b>The Dutch Masters<br/></b>The Spanish museum also boasts numerous iconic Dutch paintings, such as the major work by Hieronymus Bosch (1450-1516): "The Garden of Earthly Delights," a triptych oil painting on oak panels. Viewers can immerse themselves in its many details, like this excerpt showing maltreated ears, from the much larger 2.20 x 3.9-meter (7.2 x 12.8-foot) triptych addressing the Christian story of creation.</figcaption>

Dutch painter Peter Paul Rubens likewise spent his life working on depictions of ancient narratives. In the painting "Mercury and Argus" (here, an excerpt) he masterfully depicts how Mercury, messenger of the gods, attacks the guard Argos in order to liberate the nymph Io, who has been transformed into a cow.</figcaption>

His painting "Peasant Dance for the Archdukes" shows the full mastery of this visionary artist. Brueghels the Elder was considered a master in representing peasant life.<br/>Author: Jochen Kürten (als)</figcaption>

      <p>The Prado Museum in Madrid — called the Museo Nacional del Prado in Spanish —  has actually been celebrating its 200th birthday for quite some time. The festivities for one of the country's most-famous art museums started in 2018, with special exhibitions for the important anniversary. The show "Museo del Prado 1819 - 2019. A place of memory,"for example,<i> </i>ran until March 2019, and featured masterpieces ranging from Velazquez and Goya to Picasso and Eduardo Arroyo. </p>
      <p>
        <b>It all began with 300 paintings</b>
      </p>
      <p>The museum was originally called the National Museum of Paintings and Sculptures and opened to the public on November 19, 1819. As the name suggests, paintings and sculptures were the focus in the early years. The original collection was only 300 paintings, primarily by Spanish artists, but over time, the collection grew. In the 1980s, the decision was made to separate "old" from "new" works and modern art pieces such as those by Picasso, Dalí or Antoni Tapies, which were moved to the Museo Reina Sofía. The Old Masters, works created between the 12th and 18th centuries, remained at the Prado.</p>

      <p>
        <b>A quickly growing collection</b>
      </p>
      <p>In addition to a multitude of paintings and around 700 sculptures, the Prado Museum's collection now includes drawings, prints, coins and medals as well as around 2,000 other works of art. Highlights for the visitors are, of course the 8,600 paintings, which feature almost all of the big names in art history. Spanish painters are better represented at the Prado than anywhere else in the world, particularly Goya and Velazquez.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Special exhibitions in the anniversary year</b>
      </p>
      <p>A sizeable exhibition of drawings by Goya will run until February 2020, as will one with paintings by Sofonisba Anguissola and Lavinia Fontana. Both lived in the 16th century and disproved of the stereotypes of their time, which questioned the creative and artistic abilities of women. Fontana even had a career as court painter to Pope Clement VIII and Paul V. Another event, the exhibition of sculptures by Swiss sculptor Alberto Giacometti (1901-1966), should serve as proof that Prado does not "only" dedicate itself to older art.</p>

        <b>A new way to look at Old Masters</b>
      </p>
      <p>And like all of the world's largest museums, the Prado Museum is doing its best to attract younger visitors. Collaborating with tech giant Google, the museum has been participating in a project to digitally catalogue its most famous artworks. Fourteen of these pieces can now be viewed from a distance, but with striking accuracy.</p>
      <p>Yet, the technology doesn't replace the experience of seeing a Goya masterpiece at close range — especially during the museum's 200th anniversary year.</p>
