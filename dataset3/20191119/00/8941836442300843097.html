      <p>ORINDA, Calif. (AP) - Prosecutors said Monday that they won’t immediately file criminal charges against five men arrested on suspicion of shooting up a <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/san-francisco-bay-area-halloween-party/">San Francisco Bay Area Halloween party</a>, killing five people.</p>
      <p>The Contra Costa County district attorney’s office couldn’t meet the standard for filing charges by Monday’s deadline, spokesman Scott Alonso said.</p>
      <p>“We need more information,” he said. “We are not ready to file charges and we will not file charges until we can.”</p>
      <p>“This is a very complex case,” he added.</p>
      <p>However, charges “absolutely” could be filed later, he said.</p>

      <p>“If there’s more evidence that comes to light, we will certainly reevaluate it as it comes in,” Alonso said.</p>
      <p>Because of the filing deadline, the men must be released from custody unless they have parole violations or warrants, Alonso said.</p>
      <p>Jail records indicated that four of the five were no longer in custody Monday night, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.</p>
      <p>After a series of raids in several Bay Area cities, four men were arrested Thursday on suspicion of murder. The party promoter was arrested on suspicion of being an accessory.</p>

        <p>The Oct. 31 shooting at an Airbnb rental home in quiet, upscale Orinda was a “bloodbath,” Contra Costa Sheriff David Livingston said last week.</p>
        <p>Members of rival gangs from San Francisco and Marin City were among the estimated 100 people at the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/san-francisco-bay-area-halloween-party/">unsanctioned party</a>, which was advertised on social media, he said.</p>
        <p>Livingston said that an altercation started in the kitchen of the house, and witnesses told investigators someone tried to steal someone else’s property, which may have precipitated the shooting.</p>
        <p>Video showed some people tucking guns into their pants as they slipped past a front-door security guard, and some people went to the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/san-francisco-bay-area-halloween-party/">party</a> “with intent of causing harm and conflict,” the sheriff said.</p>
        <p>The shooting killed Tiyon Farley, 22, of Antioch; Omar Taylor, 24, of Pittsburg; Raymon Hill Jr., 23, of San Francisco and Oakland; Javlin County, 29, of Sausalito and Richmond; and Oshiana Tompkins, 19, of Vallejo and Hercules.</p>
        <p>Two of the dead had guns, Livingston said.</p>
        <p>Five people were injured, including one who jumped from a balcony to escape the gunfire.</p>
        <p>Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky has since said that the San Francisco-based company was taking steps to stop unauthorized parties in the wake of the deadly shooting.</p>
