      <p>The Minority in Parliament has accused the Majority side of the House of not taking the business of the House seriously.</p>
      <p>In a statement on Tuesday, 19 November 2019, the leadership of the Minority said it “notes with grave concern” the absence of the Majority side of the House “at the commencement of sitting”, a situation which, it said, prompted the Speaker, Prof Mike Oquaye “to suspend the sitting for an hour”.</p>
      <p>“The House currently stands suspended as the leadership has gone into conclave on the matter”, the statement signed by Minority Leader Haruna Iddrisu said.</p>
      <p>“It is worrying”, the Minority complained, “as the core business for Parliament this week is to deliberate on the financial policy of the government for 2020 as presented by the Finance Minister last Wednesday”.</p>
      <p>“The budget debates are a crucial parliamentary function and the lack of interest of the Majority side of the House is disturbing”, the statement observed, adding: “The core mandate of oversight and scrutiny of appropriations is at the heart of Parliament and we would guard this role jealousy”.</p>
      <p>The Minority said it is “committed to its role in protecting our democracy and maintaining a high level of dedication to our parliamentary work”.</p>
      <p>“We urge the Majority side to take the government seriously and commit themselves to the mandate for which they have been elected. The people of Ghana deserve better”.</p>
