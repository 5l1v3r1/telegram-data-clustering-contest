        <b>On 19th November 1995, Gianluigi Buffon made his Parma debut at 17. On the 24th anniversary of his debut, we remember some information that is less known.</b>

        <b>A sporty family</b>
      </p>
      <p>Buffon's mum, Maria Stella, was a discus thrower and held the Italian record for 17 years. His dad is a shot put champion. His sisters, Gigi, Guendalina, and Veronica, also play volleyball.</p>

        <b>Phobia of Wasps</b>
      </p>
      <p>The goalkeeper has always been scared of wasps. A curious story with Capello: 'Just before a match the goalkeeper coach told me that Buffon wasn't going to be able to play. He couldn't play because there were so many wasps on the park. I told him that it was no problem and ten seconds later he told me that he no longer had a phobia'.</p>

      <p>Yes, Gigi was a Borussia Monchengladbach fan when he was younger, a team whose name he didn't know how to pronounce. 'When I was younger I didn't know how to pronounce their name. Now I say it better but I don't think that I do it all right', he recalled.</p>

        <b>Midfielder</b>
      </p>
      <p>Buffon started to play in midfield, but he knew of N'Kono and his admiration for the Cameroonian goalkeeper made him change position. His first child is called Louis Thomas, in honour of the goalkeeper, and the second David Lee, in honour of the Van Halen singer, David Lee Rot.</p>

        <b>Buffon, president</b>
      </p>
      <p>The goalkeeper was the president of the team from his town, Carrarese, until 2015. On his gloves are the abbreviation C.U.I.T, Commando Ultra Indian Trips, a Carrarese fans group.</p>
