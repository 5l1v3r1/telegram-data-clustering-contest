      <p>The Deputy National Organiser of the opposition National Democratic Congress (NDC) has revealed that the Member of Parliament for Kumbungu Constituency, will be disciplined for his ‘Yes’ vote campaign ahead of the December referendum.</p>
      <p>According to Chief Nixon Party, the ‘No vote’ campaign is a collective decision of the party and he expects its members to abide by the directive.</p>
      <p>“The position of the party is a ‘no vote’ and so if Ras Mubarak has decided to publicly declare a ‘yes vote’ for the referendum, then we will discipline him as a party,” he said.</p>
      <p>However, Ras Mubarak says the arguments against the amendment of Article 55/3 of the Constitution are weak and unacceptable.</p>
      <p>Speaking on Adom TV’s Badwam, Tuesday, Chief Biney said the NDC will maintain its ‘no vote’ stance in the referendum.</p>
      <p>“The party’s National Chairman, Ofosu-Ampofo has already declared the party’s stance on the referendum because we believe the development at the local level must not be a winner-takes-all; so why must a party member and parliamentarian declare a contrary view,” he added.</p>
