      <p>Investigators looking into a case of alleged police brutality in Navua last Monday have been given a deadline until this Friday by Police Commissioner Sitiveni Qiliho who is personally overseeing investigations.</p>
      <p>The man who was arrested from his home in Navua last Monday morning claims that police officers allegedly poured hot water on him during the questioning process.</p>
      <p>He sustained burns and has since been admitted to the Navua Hospital.</p>
      <p>Qiliho told Fijivillage the deadline he has given investigators is Friday but if they need more time, they need to get his approval.</p>
      <p>The Police Commissioner says there are two parallel investigations underway.</p>
      <p>He says the Director of Internal Affairs and Director of the Criminal Investigations Department are investigating.</p>
      <p>Qiliho says the Director of Internal Affairs is investigating whether there were attempts to cover up the issue by the officers allegedly involved.</p>
      <p>The Police Commissioner says he will make decisions this week on whether some constables allegedly involved will be suspended pending the outcome of the investigation.</p>
      <p>The Fiji Human Rights and Anti-Discrimination Commission is also carrying out its investigations.</p>
      <p>They have visited Navua Police Station and checked their records and confirm the victim was arrested on the morning of 4th November this year and was taken to the Pacific Harbour Police Post and interrogated by three police officers.</p>
