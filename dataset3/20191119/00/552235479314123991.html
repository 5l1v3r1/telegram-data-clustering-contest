      <p>YOU don’t need to be a rocket scientist to raise kids – just need to trust your instincts and do your best.</p>
      <p>As every parent – or anyone who looks after kids – knows, it’s a roller coaster of ups and downs.</p>
      <p>From the special moments, such as the chats that leave you laughing and the pictures they draw for the fridge, to the battles over screen time, homework meltdowns, or shopping strops – parenting challenges remain the same.</p>
      <p>It’s handy to have an arsenal of tricks up your sleeve that you can pull out when the going gets tough.</p>
      <p>The Scottish Government’s campaign helps make parents’ and carers lives easier with brilliant ways to tackle tricky times.</p>
      <p>Its <a href="https://www.parentclub.scot/">ParentClub website</a> is full of little things you can try out to keep the kids busy – and lower stress levels. The ideas are simple and either free or cheap to do and have come from parents, so are tried and tested.</p>
      <p>Wonder how to unstick them from their screens? Getting them to make a poster of their favourite game or app is a good way to keep them busy.</p>
      <p>Or need a way to divert them from a huff? Try space travel – writing a list of everything they’d need for a trip to space is a fun way to keep them happy.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.parentclub.scot/">ParentClub</a> has many more tips to help the parents and carers of primary aged children. During the next few weeks, we will talk to parents to understand their challenges and hear how they deal with screens, shopping, and managing time with a small person.</p>
      <p>Nicole Stewart, from Kilwinning, Ayrshire, is mum to Leo, four, who has just started Primary One.</p>
      <p>A nurse, Nicole, 28, has some great advice for other parents.</p>

      <p>She says: “I think screen time is quite important now because kids are growing up in that generation where everyone has them.</p>
      <p>“But we like to limit it, especially before bedtime or homework, because it can make him quite hyper,” she says.</p>
      <p>“We take the iPad away and do things like reading a book before bedtime or taking him outside on his bike during the day.</p>
      <p>“After school, when Leo’s a bit grumpy, often it’s because he’s hungry. We give him a little snack and time to draw a picture, rather than bombarding him with loads of questions.</p>
      <p>“And out shopping, we give him a list, but we use pictures and a number of how many we need – it keeps him interested and it’s almost like a treasure hunt.”</p>
      <h3>Simple fun and games to make children smile again</h3>
      <p>• IF THEY’RE ABOUT TO GO OFF IN A HUFF, try space travel. Writing a list of everything they need for a trip to space is a fun way to keep them busy.</p>
      <p>• TO UNSTICK THEM FROM THEIR SCREENS, try poster play. Getting them to make a poster of their favourite game or app is an engaging way to occupy them.</p>
      <p>• TO GET THEM OUT OF AN AFTERSCHOOL GRUMP, try giraffes. Measure their height and compare it to different animals.</p>
      <p>• TO STOP YOUR SHOP BECOMING A STROP, try bargain hunt. Asking them to find all the items on your list for less than £1 can make the trip entertaining.</p>
