      <p>CAIRO - 19 November 2019: A total of 14,760 citizens were registered in the new comprehensive health insurance system in South Sinai governorate since October. <br/><br/>This came during a visit by a delegation of the Ministry of Health on Tuesday, to follow-up on the registration process of citizens in medical units in Abu Suwaira and Abu Bouznima cities in South Sinai. <br/><br/>The follow-up is part of the execution of the new health insurance system in South Sinai. <br/><br/>The comprehensive health insurance system is based on separating between the service provider, the funding body, and the control body, the minister stated, adding the new system allows the participation of private sector medical providers. <br/><br/>In October, Finance Minister Mohamed Maeit said that the comprehensive health insurance system enjoys a strong political will, aiming at offering better healthcare for all citizens. <br/><br/>Addressing a press conference on Monday following the inauguration of the temporary headquarters of the General Authority for Comprehensive Health Insurance, Maeit noted that President Abdel Fattah El Sisi always closely follows up the developments in the new system to ensure perfect implementation.</p>
