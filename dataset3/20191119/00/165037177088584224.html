        <b>An Argentina v Uruguay match has that historic spicy ingredient. With competitiveness in their blood, the two South American teams once again met in a friendly match... that didn't seem to be the case. That's how Leo Messi and Edinson Cavani let him see it.</b>

      <p>Messi and Cavani, Cavani and Messi. Two of the players with the most character in their national teams. In the middle of a match, and after a moment of tension, it was impossible to avoid sparks between them.</p>
      <p>In the 1st half and with Uruguay winning 1-0, the Argentine was down. The Uruguayan striker said something to him (possibly challenging him) and Messi did not dodge the invitation.</p>
      <p>"Whenever you want, whenever you want," Messi repeated several times after Cavani, with a mischievous laugh, said something to him. The exchanges didn't stop there.</p>

      <p>Minutes later they exchanged whispers. Messi, again, angry with the PSG striker, who saw how Leo showed his character again , just as he did in the last Copa América in Brazil when talking about refereeing.</p>
