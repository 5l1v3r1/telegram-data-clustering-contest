      <p>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) - Officials in Virginia say the state is seeing an alarming uptick in the number of motorcycle deaths where the rider wasn’t a wearing a helmet.</p>
      <p>The Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles said in a press release Tuesday that seven motorcyclists who weren’t wearing helmets died this year. The department said the number is the highest it’s been in a decade.</p>
      <p>The state says that helmets are about 29 percent effective in preventing motorcyclist deaths and about 67 percent effective in preventing brain injuries.</p>
      <p>Put another way, the state says a rider without a helmet is 40 percent more likely to suffer a fatal head injury.</p>
