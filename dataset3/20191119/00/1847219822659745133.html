        <b>Hong Kong’s pro-democracy protests a standoff between activists and riot police continues at a university, where around 600 protesters have surrendered and 400 have been arrested, local authorities say.</b>

      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/19/hong-kong-protests-hundreds-surrender-to-police-after-university-standoff">British news portal The Guardian reports</a> that the chief executive of the semi-autonomous Chinese city, Carrie Lam, stated about 600 protesters surrendered to authorities overnight to Tuesday, November 19, after police allowed two representatives to mediate between the two sides.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, around 20 activists were evacuated to seek medical help.</p>
      <p>Lam, in her first public remarks since the crisis began more than 36 hours ago, said that 200 of those who surrendered were children and were not arrested. She said however that authorities reserved the right to make further investigations in the future. Lam said the other 400 who left the campus have been arrested.</p>
      <p>The campus in Kowloon, has become the focus of the most prolonged and tense confrontation between police and protesters in more than five months of conflict in the semi-autonomous city.</p>
      <p>The Guardian reports that tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets in the last two days in attempt to reach the protesters at the university, prompting intense clashes with riot police firing tear gas and rubber bullets and in a few incidents, live rounds.</p>
