      <h1>Lord of the Rings TV show renewed for season 2</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/staff-writer" target="_blank">Staff Writer</a></address>
      <p>The first episode of Amazon’s upcoming The Lord of the Rings TV series is yet to air, but plans are already in motion for its second season.</p>
      <p><a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/the-lord-of-the-rings-series-renewed-season-2-amazon-early-renewal-season-1-hiatus-writers-room-reassembled-1202788730/"><b>According to Deadline</b></a>, Amazon Studios has officially given the green light for season 2 of the show.</p>
      <p>Although the company <a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/broadcasting/237414-amazon-to-make-the-lord-of-the-rings-tv-series.html"><b>acquired worldwide television rights</b></a> for a multi-season LOTR series back in 2017, it still needs to approve every new season of the show before production can take place.</p>
      <p>According to the report, Amazon’s plan is to film the first two episodes of the first season and then take a break in production to finish the writing for the second season.</p>
      <p>Deadline said this approach is well-known for straight-to-series orders, as it helps the producers to assess the first material and make well-informed adjustments for future episodes if required.</p>
      <p>It could also make it easier to film parts of the second season in conjunction with the second batch of episodes from season one.</p>
      <h3>Writers and production</h3>
      <p>J.D. Payne and Patrick McKay will act as executive producers on the project. The pair were working on Star Trek 4 with JJ Abrams before it was cancelled.</p>
      <p>Writers for the show include Gennifer Hutchison (Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul), Helen Shang (13 Reasons Why, Hannibal), Jason Cahill (The Sopranos), and Justin Doble (Stranger Things).</p>
      <p>The series is expected to be set during the Second Age of Middle-Earth, before the events of The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings.</p>
      <p>Production will take place in the United States and New Zealand, where Peter Jackson’s original films were filmed.</p>
      <p>Amazon has not announced an official release date for the TV show.</p>
