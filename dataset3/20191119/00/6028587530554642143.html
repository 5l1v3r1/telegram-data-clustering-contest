      <h1>5 Destinations Suffering From Overtourism (And Where To Go Instead)</h1>

      <p>Overtourism is a huge issue. A large influx of tourists, while economically beneficial to destinations in some ways, can also kill certain aspects of a destination that make it, well, desirable. Too many tourists crowding into one place at a time can damage infrastructure, drive out local businesses, harm historic architecture, dilute local culture and lead to increased pollution. </p>

      <p>Are you considering traveling to one of these five destinations? Maybe skip it in the coming year, so you’re not adding to the world’s overtourism issue, and look into a similar destination instead. Perhaps you'll discover something new without having to worry about massive crowds or inflated prices.</p>
      <p>
        <b>1. Instead Of Rome, Try Padua</b>
      </p>
      <p>Much like Venice, Rome’s beautiful history and architecture, so open and available to the public, is at risk of being damaged due to the massive amount of tourists enjoying the city’s most famous sites. For example, one famous site in Rome, the Spanish Steps, had to be closed several years ago and cleaned due to the extra attention. The site required nearly $2 million in repairs, a venture that was privately funded. </p>
      <p>Let Rome’s best sites rest for a while and visit another great Italian city instead, the Shakespearean favorite of Padua. As the small city is incredibly historic, there’s Renaissance art, cathedrals and museums galore. There are even canals.</p>
      <p>Other attractions include the Botanical Garden of Padua, with its history stretching back to 1545.</p>
      <p>
        <b>2. Instead Of Mount Everest, Try Mount Meru</b>
      </p>
      <p>Climbing Mount Everest isn’t on everyone’s bucket list. For some of us, it actually seems like something totally out of line with anything we’d want to do while traveling. Plus many don’t consider that the tallest mountain in the world could be overcrowded — yet, somehow, it is.</p>
      <p>The lines to get up to the summit of Mount Everest are so congested and long that people are literally dying from being up there too long and the mountainside is filling up with trash.</p>
      <p>If you have the urge to climb a really tall mountain, maybe leave Everest be for the time being (it’s not going anywhere after all), and try Mount Meru, Mount Kilimanjaro’s little sister. While Kilimanjaro is Africa’s highest peak, Mount Meru is Tanzania’s second-tallest mountain.</p>
      <p>It offers some perks that Kilimanjaro doesn’t, such as more wildlife spotting opportunities and views of the rest of the surrounding landscape.  </p>
      <p>
        <b>3. Instead Of Machu Picchu, Try Kuelap</b>
      </p>
      <p>Like Everest, a visit to Machu Picchu requires a hike. But, this hike is much more accessible to the average traveler. There’s no treacherous climbing that requires special skills. Because of that, 1.4 million people were, at one point, seeing the place a year. Unfortunately, that was damaging the UNESCO site and leading to increased pollution.</p>
      <p>Now, the country has imposed a visitor limit of 5,000 visitors per day, but UNESCO says that’s still about twice too many visitors. </p>
      <p>So, instead of hiking around Machu Picchu, climbing over ruins and teasing llamas for your camera, how about you visit Kuelap? The Kuelap ruins are in northern Peru, near the Ecuadorian border. It’s affordable to visit and to hire a guide, and you can reach the ruins via a bus ride and a hike. </p>
      <p>
        <b>4. Instead Of Amsterdam, Try Leiden</b>
      </p>
      <p>Amsterdam is a major European city, but that doesn’t mean that it can withstand hordes of tourists, like those that flock to similar cities such as London and New York City. After all, Amsterdam only has a population of less than 1 million locals. The tourists all typically flock to certain, popular areas, and then they disturb the peace, acting out just because Amsterdam comes with a certain reputation for a more liberal way of thinking. </p>
      <p>Leave the Amsterdam locals alone and maybe explore some other areas of the Netherlands. Leiden, with its large university student population, big nightlife scene, rich history and great dining is a great alternative. </p>
      <p>
        <b>5. Instead Of Venice, Try Bruges</b>
      </p>
      <p>Venice is probably one of the most notably overtouristed destinations in the world. Travelers are crowding the canals, destroying local culture and driving up the price of living in the city so much that families who’ve called Venice home for generations are being forced out. The tourist's litter and are the cause of congested traffic.</p>
      <p>Instead of visiting Venice, why not try a smaller European destination with its own canals, like Bruges? Just fly into Brussels and take the train to Bruges, Belgium’s capital. Here, you can travel canals and float by medieval, fairytale-style architecture, while you enjoy the very quaint and small feel of the city.</p>
      <p>Despite it being a major European city and the capital of the European Union, Bruges is decidedly not too crowded. </p>
