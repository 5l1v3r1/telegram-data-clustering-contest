      <p><a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/banks-private-sector/icicibank/ICI02">ICICI Bank</a> is looking to raise around Rs 20,000 crore by selling six-to-seven percent stake to institutional investors and has approached at least 10 investment banks for the same, <a href="https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/icici-bank-plans-20-000-cr-capital-boost-via-qip-11574101552394.html">reports</a> Mint.</p>
      <p>The country's largest private-sector lender plans to complete the entire raise in a single tranche and may soon issue formal mandates to some of the investment banks it approached, sources told the paper.</p>
      <p>The move, which would be the largest such capital raise in India, is aimed at subverting liquidity squeeze created in the sector after the IL&amp;FS debacle and subsequent busts.</p>
      <p>The qualified institutional placement (QIP) way was zeroed in on after the bank dropped plans to issue American depositary receipts (ADRs), the source said.</p>
      <p>Moneycontrol could not independently verify the report.</p>
      <p>This is also being seen as an opportunity for banks to gain back market share from non-banking financial institutions (NBFCs) in the infrastructure sector, the report said.</p>
      <p>"If the bank is able to raise this money, they should use the opportunity to do so and use the capital in phases," the paper quoted a Mumbai-based banking analyst as saying.</p>
      <p>If the fund raising goes through, ICICI Bank would be following in the footsteps of multiple private-sector lenders that have already bettered or are considering improving their growth capital via QIPs.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/banks-private-sector/yesbank/YB">Yes Bank</a> recently announced plans to raise $1.2 billion this fiscal, <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/banks-private-sector/axisbank/AB16">Axis Bank</a> raised Rs 12,500 crore in September and public lender <a href="http://www.moneycontrol.com/india/stockpricequote/banks-public-sector/statebankindia/SBI">State Bank of India</a> (SBI) raised Rs 15,000 crore in what was then the country’s largest QIP in 2017.</p>
      <p>QIPs allows listed companies to raise capital, without the attached burden of submitting legal paperwork to market regulators.</p>
