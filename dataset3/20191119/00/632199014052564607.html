      <p>Users of BP Chargemaster’s electric vehicle (EV) charge point network and the number of charging sessions have more than doubled, with the amount of energy supplied almost tripling in the past year.</p>
      <p>Its charge points operated are now delivering more than 60 MWh (60,000 kWh) of energy per day.</p>
      <p>Based on an electric car averaging four miles per kilowatt hour (kWh) that equates to around 1.5 million miles per week of driving by electric cars.</p>
      <p>It also equates to around 300 tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions avoided weekly by BP Chargemaster customers.</p>
      <p>David Newton, COO of BP Chargemaster, said: “Powering around 1.5 million electric miles a week makes us the most-used public charging infrastructure operator in the UK.”</p>
      <p>He continued: “We have seen incredible growth in the utilisation of our public charging network over the past 12 months, with both the number of charging sessions and number of users more than doubling, and the amount of energy supplied almost tripling. This reflects the larger batteries and the longer distances being driven by the latest electric vehicles.”</p>
      <p>BP Chargemaster is continuing to expand Polar, the UK’s largest public charging network now with about 7,000 charging points available, including with the deployment of ultra-fast 150kW chargers on BP forecourts.</p>
      <p>BP’s first 150kW forecourts are already live in London and Essex, with other installations in England and Wales going live imminently, and the first sites in Scotland due before the end of the year.</p>
