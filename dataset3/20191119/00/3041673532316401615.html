      <h1>The Aston Martin DBX Has Finally Been Revealed. So, What Do You Think Of The Latest High-End Sports SUV?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://petrolicious.com/author/news-desk" target="_blank">News Desk</a></address>
      <p>Aston Martin has just unveiled the DBX, its first-ever SUV at a gala event in Beijing, China. It would be a massive understatement to say that this is just a new model for the brand as this new vehicle not only has to deliver the broadest design brief of any Aston Martin in history but it also represents a totally new chapter in the marque’s 106-year history.</p>
      <p>Aston Martin Lagonda President &amp; Group CEO, Dr Andy Palmer said, “I can’t emphasize enough how incredibly exciting and significant DBX is for Aston Martin. Through its development alone, this beautiful SUV has already taken the company into new territories and in inspiring directions. DBX also marks a key moment in the delivery of the third and final phase of our Second Century Plan, not only representing the promised expansion of our portfolio but also signaling the start of production at Aston Martin’s second manufacturing plant.</p>
      <p>“We have both delivered this model through our expertise, but also by garnering invaluable experience and knowledge from external counsel, including our Female Advisory Board. This is a real landmark for this great British brand and I promise that DBX will reward all who experience it in their everyday lives.”</p>

      <p>Straight-line performance is key in any Aston Martin and the DBX doesn’t disappoint. It’s powered by a new version of the 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8 already doing duty in the DB11 and Vantage, and in this application it produces 542hp along with 516 lb-ft of torque, enough for a 0 to 60mph time of 4.3-seconds and a top speed of 181mph.</p>
      <p>A nine-speed automatic transmission sends that power to an AWD system featuring an active central differential and an electronic rear limited-slip differential (eDiff). An adaptive triple volume air suspension system combined with a 48v electric anti-roll control system (eARC) further expands the DBX’s dynamic capabilities while also maintaining a high level of ride comfort.</p>
      <p>Bonded aluminum construction methods have resulted in a very stiff and very light body structure, although in a vehicle of this type the term ‘light’ is relative, the DBX still tips the scales at 4,949 pounds. A fair bit heftier than more traditional sports cars but right in the ballpark compared to its SUV rivals.</p>

      <p>Curb weight aside, the new Aston does excel in areas where none of its predecessors have: it’s the marque’s first full-size five-seater and it offers more occupant and cargo space than any Aston Martin before. The interior is a hand-crafted haven of fine leather and soft-touch materials and it can be personalized to each owner’s individual tastes through the ‘Q by Aston Martin’ bespoke service.</p>
      <p>The first 500 owners will also have their cars fitted with an exclusive ‘1913 Package’. It comprises of a unique fender badge, sill plaques and an inspection plaque detailing its limited build-run, each of these first examples will be personally endorsed and inspected by Andy Palmer.</p>

      <p>Andy Palmer continued, “DBX is a car that will give many people their first experience of Aston Martin ownership. As such, it needed to be true to the core values established in our sports cars, while also providing the lifestyle versatility expected of a luxury SUV. To have produced such a beautiful, hand-built, yet technologically advanced car is a proud moment for Aston Martin.”</p>
      <p>Deliveries of the Aston Martin DBX are scheduled to begin in the second half of 2020 and pricing before customization starts at £158,000 in the UK, €193,500 in Germany and $189,900 in the US.</p>
