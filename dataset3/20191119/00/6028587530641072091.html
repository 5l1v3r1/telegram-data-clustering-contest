      <p>If you missed out on <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/games/2019/07/12/dragon-quest-builders-2-review-an-ambitious-sequel-that-sadly-falls-short/"><i>Dragon Quest Builders 2</i></a> on the PlayStation 4 and Switch earlier this year, you will be happy to know that it is coming to PC this December.The <i>Dragon Quest Builders</i> games are action role-playing games where you can build all manner of things in a manner not too dissimilar to <i>Minecraft</i>.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/games/2016/03/04/dragon-quest-builders-review-its-better-than-minecraft/">first <i>Dragon Quest Builders</i> game</a> was released a fair few years back and it was thoroughly excellent.</p>
      <p>The added twist here is that the story of these games is currently tied into the <a href="https://dragon-quest.org/wiki/Erdrick_trilogy">Erdrick Trilogy</a> of <i>Dragon Quest</i> games that debuted back on the NES during the 80s.</p>
      <p>That means there are all sorts of references to parts of classic <i>Dragon Quest</i> lore, which adds an interesting layer to the overall narrative.</p>
      <p>While I <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/olliebarder/2019/08/15/finishing-all-the-challenges-in-dragon-quest-builders-2-is-really-quite-tedious/">definitely preferred the first <i>Dragon Quest Builders</i> over this sequel</a>, it is still a good game and having it available on PC is something I think is entirely worthwhile.</p>
      <p>I only hope that the first <i>Dragon Quest Builders</i> is released on PC at some point in the future as well.</p>
      <p><i>Dragon Quest Builders 2</i> is released on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1072420/DRAGON_QUEST_BUILDERS_2/">Steam</a> on December 11.</p>
