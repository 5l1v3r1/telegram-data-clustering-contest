      <p><i>By Namrata Zakaria</i> <br/><br/>WOULD you believe me if I told you one that the humble T-shirt is now a high-fashion garment? Well, sit down for this one, but your basic white tee is suddenly the coolest thing you own. If you paid Rs 300 for it at H&amp;M, nobody needs to know. So long as it looks fresh and clean, you could pass it off for a Prada (erm, those cost 270 pounds). <br/><br/>This is not quite what they meant when they invented the phrase “fashion democracy”. While designer labels invented ready-to-wear collections to reach to a large demographic – while fattening up their bottomlines – fashion seems to be a bit confused with the basic T-shirt costing as much as $1,000 (Versace) or more (Ashish, $1,500). <br/><br/>It’s odd, but the T-shirt isn’t just a T-shirt any more. It has quickly become a symbol of so many things all at once. Only last week, two of the world’s biggest pop stars posted pictures wearing T-shirts. Rihanna’s was by London-based fashion label Art School, while Harry Styles posted his fabulous new song ‘Lights Up’ wearing one under his Harris Reed suit. Both labels identify as gender fluid: Art School defines itself as a “non-binary queer luxury label”, while Reed is “fighting for the beauty of fluidity”. The T-shirt has become the greatest unifier in fashion then. A symbol of one-size, one-style for everyone. <br/><br/>‘Non binary’ is a new term in fashion, even though several designers have identified themselves as homosexual. The Collins dictionary has just announced it was adding it to its books. It’s especially pertinent to a younger generation where, according to some reports, more than one in 10 millennials identify as transgender or gender non-conforming. Newer fashion labels like One DNA, and in India, the well-known Arjun Saluja, besides Alan Alexander Kaleekal, Two Point Two by Anvita Sharma and Asit Barik and Bloni are promoting fluid fashion. <br/><br/>The T-shirt became a feminist tool when Dior’s Maria Grazia Chiuri put a slogan on it saying ‘We Should All Be Feminists’, taking from Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie’s remarkable essay on the topic. The white tee became an instant sensation when it was launched in 2017, at a precious tag of 500 pounds (approximately Rs 42,000). It was almost always sold out and had to be pre-ordered. This year, Chiuri revisits her golden goose with her ‘Sisterhood’ slogan T-shirts: three variants that have filled magazine advertorials all year around. Prabal Gurung made 38 white T-shirt styles in 2017 inspired by the Women’s March of that year, asking for feminism, inclusivity and equality. <br/><br/>The T-shirt is also a blank page, and slogan T-shirts gave it a new life thanks to political messages and activism coming out on the streets once again. Dazey LA is a cheeky feminist label that makes 100 per cent organic T-shirts with a slow fashion approach. Everything the label makes is to-order, completely eliminating waste. It costs $52 but it’s a small price to pay when you are saving the planet and looking so chic while doing so, no? <br/><br/>All sloganeers don’t get it right. It-label Vetements sent out T-shirts that read ‘Don’t Shoot’ in Arabic, French and English at its recent Spring Summer 2020 show, a replica of the one worn by journalists in Lebanon during the Israeli invasion in 1982. The label has been accused of instigating trouble in the region and reminding people of a very painful war where thousands of lives were lost. Coach, Givenchy and Versace had to apologise to China after disregarding its ‘One China’ policy on its T-shirts. <br/><br/><br/>But if fashion is behaving like the T-shirt is a modern thing, don’t be fooled. Its simple shape, the two T shapes stitched together, have been recorded in Europe in the Middle Ages. It was originally worn as an undergarment for men, in easy to wash cotton. In the 19th century, its shirt tails (that were to be tucked between the legs) were removed and its body fitted down to a slimmer fit. New knitting technologies allowed for various fabrics such as calico, wool and jersey. <br/><br/>Marlon Brando popularised, maybe even sexualised, the T-shirt in ‘A Streetcar Named Desire’. He showed it as symbol of masculinity, but also a snub of the establishment that dictated it was to be an undershirt. The T-shirt first became a symbol of agitation in 1970 when feminists wore them, de-sexualising how men viewed them. Interestingly, the first time the word ‘T-shirt’ was used in print was in 1920, shortly after WWI, by the terrific American writer F Scott Fitzgerald in his novel, ‘This Side of Paradise’. <br/><br/><br/>Whatever its politics and history, the simple T-shirt is irresistible and insouciant at once.</p>
