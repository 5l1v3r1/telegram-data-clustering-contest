      <p><i>Dozens of university students trapped for two days escape using ropes and motorcycles in a dramatic and perilous breakout<br/></i><br/>As night fell in Hong Kong, police tightened a siege on Monday at a university campus as hundreds of anti-government protesters were trapped inside. Dozens of students escaped a two-day police siege late on Monday by shimmying down a rope from a bridge to awaiting motorbikes in a dramatic and perilous breakout. <br/><br/>Protesters advanced on the police from outside the cordon, while others emerged from the campus, their trademark umbrellas at the fore. Police in some places swooped in to subdue protesters and make arrests. It wasn't clear if any of those inside Hong Kong Polytechnic University escaped. <br/><br/>Hong Kong's work week started with multiple protests that disrupted traffic, and schools remained closed because of safety concerns. There was a temporary lull in the pitched battles for control of the Polytechnic campus as the emphasis shifted from battering the protesters with tear gas and water cannons to waiting for them to come out. <br/><br/>For days, protesters have fortified the campus to keep police from getting in. Cornered by authorities, they were trying to get out. <br/><br/><br/>Officers repelled one attempt on Monday morning with tear gas, driving a few hundred protesters back onto the campus. The give-and-take has played out repeatedly during the city's months of anti-government unrest. The protesters want to avoid arrest. The police want to pick up as many as they can. <br/><br/>"These rioters, they are also criminals. They have to face the consequences of their acts," said Cheuk Hau-yip, the commander of Kowloon West district, where Polytechnic is located. <br/><br/><br/>At daybreak, protesters remained in control of most of the campus. In one outdoor area, some demonstrators made gasoline bombs while others dozed while wearing gas masks. Two walked about with bows and quivers of arrows, while many stared at their smartphones.
