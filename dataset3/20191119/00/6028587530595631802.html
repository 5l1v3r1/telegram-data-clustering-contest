      <p>Six years ago today, the Nets engaged in a practice that lasted approximately 2 1/2 hours and that was so long that it took place in an industrial part of Rutherford, New Jersey in the shadow of where the Giants and Jets play as opposed to the splashy practice facility a few subway stops south of the Barclays Center.Then after the lengthy practice it was Kevin Garnett’s turn to speak.</p>
      <p>Known as someone who had a way with words, Garnett was asked if he felt better about the direction of the Nets after a lengthy team meeting. He then proceeded to give a 209-word answer that started with him saying “I’m not a genie. I’m not a fortune teller. I can’t tell time.”</p>
      <p>At the time of those remarks, the Nets were a 3-7 team after significantly adding to their luxury tax bill in an ill-fated trade that eventually led to the current regime of Sean Marks and Kenny Atkinson and a rebuild that attracted free agents such as Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant to Brooklyn. When Garnett uttered those words, the Nets were coming off a nine-point home loss to the Portland Trail Blazers that hardly felt like a single-digit loss.</p>
      <p>After Garnett’s proclamation of not being able to tell time or use superpowers to predict when things would turn, it did not turn. Three more losses followed to bring the record to 3-10 and they were 10-21 after 31 games with a roster that included Paul Pierce, Deron Williams and Joe Johnson. Then things turned with a stirring final four-month sprint to the postseason that eventually ended with a loss in Game 5 in Miami on May 14, 2014, the day before two-time Cy Young Award winner Jacob deGrom made his debut for the Mets.</p>
      <p>Which brings us to the present with the Nets, who are doing a similar thing in terms of their roster with the differences being it only cost the salaries to pay Irving and Kevin Durant and increase the payroll to $126 million. But even with Irving on the team, the Nets are a pedestrian 5-8 through 13 games.</p>
      <p>While they have lost two overtime games, three other losses are by blowing double-digit leads on the road, one is a dull loss to the Indiana Pacers on Oct. 30 and the other two are via methods of what unfolded Monday. Without Irving for a second straight game due to right shoulder impingement, the Nets were non-competitive for most of a 115-86 loss to the Pacers.</p>
      <p>It was the kind of game that prompted coach Kenny Atkinson to offer this admission to the reality facing the Nets through the first 13 games of their latest era.</p>
      <p>“Below average teams are inconsistent and that’s what we are right now,” Atkinson said. We’re kind of like this and until we get the group together and find some more consistency.”</p>
      <p>It’s hard to argue with that statement, especially with what it looked like Monday and especially with the numbers that state the Nets are 17th in field goal percentage, 22nd in turnovers, 15th in offensive rating to go along with being 26th in scoring defense, 17th in opposing 3-point field goal percentage and 22nd in defensive rating.</p>
      <p>Now the question comes when does early start to become late for any team?</p>
      <p>That is difficult gauge because of history. Not every team that incorporate a new All-Star player into the mix get off to hot starts.  </p>
      <p>Exceptions might be the 2007-08 Celtics that added Garnett, the 2016-17 Warriors after adding Durant and last year’s Toronto Raptors after adding Kawhi Leonard.</p>
      <p>Those Celtics won their first eight games, 30 of their first 34 and 66 games en route to a championship. Those Warriors won 16 of their first 18 games, 50 of their first 59 and 67 games on the way to a championship. The Raptors won 12 of their first 13 games, 58 games and then the championship over Durant and the Warriors.</p>
      <p>Then there are the teams who start slowly after adding a superstar or two to the mix.</p>
      <p>One notable example is the 2010-11 Miami Heat, who were 9-8 through 17 games after adding LeBron James and Chris Bosh to the mix. Then they won 12 straight, finished with 58 games and reached the finals.</p>
      <p>Preseason projections indicate the Nets are a lower-seeded playoff team in the East, for a few reasons. The first four reside in Milwaukee, Boston, Toronto and Philadelphia and the other is because of Durant’s Achilles injury that possibly keeps him from playing at all this season.</p>
      <p>Whether the reality matches some of the expectations depends on things like avoiding things like a 29-point home loss or playing well in more than just spurts.</p>
      <p>“It’s definitely frustrating, seeing us hit our stride in spurts,” center Jarrett Allen said. “At the end of the day, we keep saying it’s going to take time.”</p>
      <p>Like Garnett said six years ago, Allen is not the genie or the fortune teller and is not about to predict when things will turn for the better.</p>
      <p>The assumption is that it will like it did for the 2013-14 Nets. What game number it begins to turn for the better is anybody’s guess.</p>
