      <p>For the first time since he lost his brother Zachary on Nov. 9, Michigan State guard Cassius Winston addressed fans and the media on Monday night.</p>
      <p>After the No. 3 Spartans beat Charleston Southern, Winston told the crowd, "I lost a piece of my heart, but you guys are keeping me going."</p>
      <p>After his comments, Winston embraced Hall of Fame coach Tom Izzo and then walked off the floor as fans gave him a standing ovation.</p>
      <p>"I just appreciate all the people,” Izzo told the Big Ten Network. “I appreciated Seton Hall’s people for cheering for him when he got announced. This is one of those things that's bigger than a game."</p>
      <p>Winston and the Spartans edged then-No. 12 Seton Hall, 76-73, <a href="https://www.nj.com/sports/2019/11/myles-powell-scores-37-but-michigan-state-outlasts-seton-hall.html">last Thursday despite 37 points from senior guard Myles Powell</a>. Both Powell and Winston are senior All-America guards.</p>
      <p>Winston went for 11 points, 8 assists and 5 rebounds in the 94-46 rout of Charleston Southern.</p>
      <p>It was the first time he addressed the media or the fans since his younger brother’s passing.</p>
      <p>"The game is still fun,” he said, <a href="https://twitter.com/BFQuinn/status/1196622506158743560">according to Brendan Quinn of The Athletic.</a></p>
      <p>The story line will continue to follow Winston and Michigan State as they pursue the program’s first NCAA title since 2000. Izzo has been to eight Final Fours with just one title, but this type of tragedy will no doubt build cohesiveness going forward.</p>
      <p>Zachary Winston died Saturday when he was struck and killed by an Amtrak train in Albion, Michigan.</p>
      <p>Albion Public Safety chief Scott Kipp confirmed via email a USA Today <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2019/11/10/zachary-winston-dies-brother-cassius-train/2555596001/?utm_source=feedblitz&amp;utm_medium=FeedBlitzRss&amp;utm_campaign=usatoday-newstopstories">report</a> “that Zachary Winston intentionally stepped in front of the train, according to his department’s interview with the engineer and based on further police investigation.”</p>
      <p>“Yes, that is correct,” Kipp wrote in an email</p>
      <p>Zachary Winston averaged 2.6 points in 13.8 minutes per game last season as a freshman.</p>
      <p>Albion President Dr. Mauri A. Ditzler issued the following statement on Sunday:</p>
      <p>“As a community, our hearts are broken today as we share the news of the passing of one of our students, <a href="https://albion.prestosports.com/sports/mbkb/2019-20/bios/winston_zachary_g79s">Zachary Winston</a>. Zach was a finance major, a student in the Gerstacker Institute for Business and Management, and member of the Albion College men's basketball team. Beyond that, he was an extremely charismatic young man with an infectious smile. Zach was a recognized leader who was well known across every facet of our campus. He was a fantastic student with a world of potential before him. He was deeply loved and will be deeply missed.</p>
      <p>“As a campus, we have provided opportunities for students, faculty and staff to receive counseling and support in the challenging days ahead. We want all students to know they are not alone.</p>
      <p>“Our hearts go out to his brothers, Khy, who is a freshman at Albion, and Cassius, who is a senior at Michigan State University, his parents and his extended family. We echo the family's request in asking everyone to respect their privacy at this time.”</p>
