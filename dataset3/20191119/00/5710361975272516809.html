      <p>LONDON (Reuters) - The dollar stabilized against a broad basket of other currencies on Tuesday after three consecutive days of losses as investors waited for the release of the minutes of the U.S. central bank meeting at end-October when policymakers had cut interest rates.</p>
      <p>Global macro hedge funds had ramped up their dollar selling for a third week according to latest weekly positioning data and some market watchers say hawkish policy minutes could trigger a dollar rebound.</p>
      <p>The greenback has hit a trough since late last week as hopes for a preliminary trade deal between the United States and China evaporated.</p>
      <p>Expectations had grown that Washington and Beijing would sign a so-called "phase one" deal this month to scale back their 16-month-long trade war but those hopes received a setback on Monday after CNBC reported China is pessimistic about agreeing to a deal, which suggests a resolution to perhaps the biggest risk to the global economy remains elusive.</p>
      <p>"Trade headlines is dominating sentiment but in terms of the key event risk, the release of the Fed minutes will be a big one for market participants," said Morten Lund, a senior FX strategist at Nordea.</p>
      <p>Against a basket of its rivals (<a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/usdollar">DXY</a>), the greenback was broadly steady at 97.84 after weakening more than 0.6% in the last three sessions. It had hit a one-month high of 98.45 on Nov. 13.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere in the currency market, the Australian dollar fell 0.16% to $0.6799 and declined 0.26% to 73.82 yen (<a href="https://www.investing.com/currencies/aud-jpy">AUDJPY=</a>).</p>
      <p>Australia's central bank "agreed a case could be made" for another cut in the 0.75% cash rate at its November meeting given unwelcome weakness in wages growth and inflation, minutes published on Tuesday showed.</p>
      <p>Sterling held firm around $1.2950 with the pound buoyed by polls pointing to a victory by the ruling Conservatives in upcoming elections.</p>
      <p>In the onshore market, the yuan fell to a two-week low of 7.0295 per dollar.</p>
