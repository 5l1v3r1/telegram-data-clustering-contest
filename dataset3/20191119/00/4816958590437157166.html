      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:45:39+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 00:45</time> by <a rel="author">Bryan Meler</a></address>
      <p>The University of Toronto Graduate Students’ Union has apologized to the Jewish student group Hillel and agreed to consider its proposal for accessible kosher food on campus after questions over the issue led to accusations of anti-Semitism, calls for boycotts and international headlines.</p>
      <p>The dispute began when one of Hillel’s members submitted a motion on Nov. 11 for the graduate students’ union to officially support the Kosher Forward Campaign, while having the union’s executive committee present it at an upcoming board of directors meeting.</p>
      <p>But on Nov. 14, a member of the graduate students’ union, the external commissioner, emailed Hillel saying the group “might be reluctant to bring the motion as a result of Hillel being ‘pro-Israel’.”</p>
      <p>The dispute caused alarm in the Jewish community, both in Canada and in Israel.</p>
      <p>On social media, some people, such as Toronto lawyer Guidy Mamann, called for a boycott on support and donations to the university “as long as they allow institutionalized #antisemitism on its campus.”</p>
      <p>Major newspapers in Israel also covered the issue; the Times of Israel running a column on it under the headline: “<a href="https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/are-jews-welcome-at-the-university-of-toronto/">Are Jews welcome at the University of Toronto</a>?”</p>
      <aside>It isn't the case that any rejection has occurred</aside>
      <p>The graduate students’ union has since issued an apology:</p>
      <p>“The external commissioner did not intend to do harm in using this language,” <a href="https://twitter.com/Yair_Rosenberg/status/1196215630736875527">wrote the union in an email to Hillel,</a> “but recognizes that this is not an excuse for the harm that the wording of this response caused to the individual receiving it, as well as to Jewish students at U of T…. The UTGSU Executive Committee is deeply sorry for the harm that this response has caused.”</p>
      <p>That said, the graduate students’ union suggested in an interview that their stance had been taken out of context and proportion.</p>
      <p>“It isn’t the case that any rejection has occurred, it just hasn’t gone to the board yet. So, the University of Toronto Graduate Students’ Union hasn’t rejected to support this campaign — that not only hasn’t happened but would be impossible for the executive to do because we don’t speak on behalf of the entire organization.</p>
      <p>“Nobody, the executive committee or the board of director, has had this motion brought before them at this time.”</p>
      <p>The spokesperson declined to provide their name, citing safety concerns over comments made over this issue.</p>
      <p>Following the apology, the proposal will be considered and a meeting is being planned between the executive, Hillel and the board member who made the request, the spokesperson said.</p>
      <aside>The external commissioner did not intend to do harm in using this language</aside>
      <p>Michael Levitt, Liberal Member of Parliament for Toronto’s York Centre riding, who has chaired the Canada-Israel Interparliamentary Group, decried the student union’s response as “anti-Semitism plain and simple.”</p>
      <p>Now the proposal will work its way through the student union bureaucracy.</p>
      <p>The next board of directors meeting is set to take place on Nov. 26.</p>
      <p>Hillel is a campus organization for Jewish students across many different universities. “Hillel Canada’s mission is to enrich the lives of Jewish undergraduate and graduate students so that they may further enrich the Jewish people and the world,” <a href="https://www.jewishcanada.org/jewish-identity/hillel-canada">according to Jewish Federations of Canada – UIA.</a></p>
      <p>“Hillel Canada works closely with the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs (www.cija.ca) to engage students as participants in Israel advocacy programs on campus and as advocates for Israel within student government and campus policies.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/Yair_Rosenberg/status/1196159666780282881">According to a Hillel University of Toronto press release</a>, the UTGSU’s initial response was due to the group’s “pro-Israel” activities, while “the Executive Committee strives to abstain from this type of discourse in order to ensure the will of the membership is accurately reflected in any votes on these motions.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bnaibrith.ca/kosher_food_drive_violates_will_of_the_membership_student_union_suggests">According to B’nai Brith Canada</a>, “the will of the membership” is an apparent reference to the UTGSU’s adoption of the Palestinian-led movement, Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS), against Israel, while UTGSU is the only student union in the country with a “committee dedicated to promoting the BDS Movement.”</p>
      <p>The Kosher Forward campaign argues that Jewish students deserve to have the same access to food on campus as any other student.</p>
