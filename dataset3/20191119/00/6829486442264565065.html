      <h1>Mallrat Just Released A Song In ‘Sims’ Language, And It’s Bizarrely Perfect</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:34:48+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 00:34</time> by <a rel="author">Joseph Earp</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://junkee.com/tag/mallrat">Mallrat</a> makes music that is at once deeply relatable and human, while also being heightened in fun and interesting ways — music that reflects your life, but through a slightly warped mirror.</p>
      <p>That is, of course, exactly what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sims"><i>The Sims</i> </a>does. (Stay with me here.)</p>
      <p><i>The Sims</i> isn’t a game precisely about human life — only a version of it. You recognise yourself in your Sims, but only in fragments. They’ll look like you one minute, and then the next they’ll be off trying to seduce a literal personification of Death or drowning in a pool because there’s no ladder and they’ve forgotten how to climb up the side.</p>

      <p>So, what I’m saying is, there’s not actually such a long distance from the work of Mallrat to the world of <i>The Sims</i> — which is why it makes perfect sense that the artist has recorded a new version of her own song ‘Charlie’, but in Simlish.</p>
      <p>Yep, Mallrat posted the whole gorgeous work of anti-art to her Instagram page.</p>
      <p>“Honest to God… The Sims commissioned me to re-record ‘Charlie’ in Simlish,” goes the caption. “Arguably this is more culturally significant than a Grammy. Full thing’s on <i>The Sims 4: Discover University</i> soundtrack.”</p>
      <p>Listen to a snippet of the version below.</p>
