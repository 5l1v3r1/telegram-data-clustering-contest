      <p>Big Machine, without mentioning Swift by name, told <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8544038/taylor-swift-amas-cleared-perform-old-songs?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=social">Billboard</a> in a statement that the company has "agreed to grant all licenses of their artists' performances to stream post-show and for re-broadcast on mutually approved platforms."</p>
      <p>The apparent truce between Swift and her former record label comes a week after the singer took to <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/taylor-swift-big-machine-amas-912950/">social media </a>to complain that Big Machine Label Group executives Scott Borchetta and Scooter Braun had blocked her efforts to sing her old songs on television "because they claim that would be re-recording my music before I’m allowed to next year," <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/taylor-swift-amas-big-machine-914127/">Rolling Stone</a> reported.</p>
      <p>Swift charged the label originally said she could not use her old music during a medley during the AMAs, the magazine reported.</p>
      <p>Borchetta and Braun's company, Ithaca Holdings, bought Big Machine, which owned Swift's six-album catalog, in June, <a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/8544038/taylor-swift-amas-cleared-perform-old-songs?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=social">Billboard </a>reported.</p>
      <p>Swift's representatives have not responded to a request for comment, the magazine reported.</p>
