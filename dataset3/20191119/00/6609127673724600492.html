        <b>BARELY a day goes by without the SNP hailing their climate crusade.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Net-zero carbon emissions are promised by 2045. They’re “world-leading” targets, we’re repeatedly told.</p>

      <p>And a major part of achieving this aim will come from cutting transport emissions.</p>
      <p>Well, let’s hope someone has told the rest of the Scottish Government.</p>
      <p>Because, as ever, it also seems like a case of one rule for them, and another for the rest of us.</p>
      <p>We learned yesterday that Scottish Government transport officials had taken nearly 900 domestic flights in five years.</p>
      <p>That’s despite its own internal guidance encouraging staff to use the “greenest and most cost-effective” transport methods available.</p>
      <p>And the numbers of domestic flights by the Government shows no sign of coming down.</p>
      <p>This all comes a matter of months after The Scottish Sun revealed how chauffeur-driven trips by SNP ministers had hit a record high.</p>
      <p>It doesn’t look great, at a time when the green agenda permeates every major statement from the First Minister.</p>
      <p>In response, we got a load of waffle from Transport Scotland about how officials were always “mindful of their carbon footprint” and “try to strike a balance”.</p>
      <p>Crucially, there was no explanation of why so many flights were needed for travelling within the UK, as opposed to, say, taking the train.</p>
      <p>Predictably, at a time when emissions need to come down,  we get nothing but hot air.</p>
      <h3>Bad choice</h3>
      <p>WE already knew Labour were struggling for reputable election candidates.</p>
      <p>Earlier this month we told how a dozen wannabe MPs had already become embroiled in slur scandals. But it seems the desperation runs even deeper.</p>

      <p>Now, we find Scottish Labour’s latest poster boy — fronting an election video on social media  — has a dubious track record, including a conviction for thuggish behaviour during rioting in London in 2010.</p>
      <p>Bryan Simpson also threw an infamous Margaret Thatcher “death party” in Glasgow city centre in 2013.</p>
      <p>Many, many, Scots — understandably — had little time, if any, for Mrs Thatcher.</p>
      <p>But hundreds of people doing a conga around George Square to celebrate the death of an old woman seems as unseemly today as it did six years ago.</p>
      <p>It’s this kind of extreme and unsettling behaviour that dogs Labour under Jeremy Corbyn. The aggressive brand of politics employed by hard-left firebrands is alien to the moderate majority.</p>
      <p>It’s one of the reasons Labour are polling at 12 per cent in Scotland — and could lose all but one of their seven MPs here.</p>
      <p>And why the bookies make Mr Corbyn a rank outsider to win a majority at the December 12 election.</p>
