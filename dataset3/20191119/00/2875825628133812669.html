      <h1>Spain manager Robert Moreno bids tearful farewell to squad with Luis Enrique set to replace him</h1>
      <h2>Moreno stepped in for Luis Enrique after the former Barcelona manager resigned from the post earlier this year but he is set to be axed on Tuesday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:59:36+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 00:59</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Spain boss Robert Moreno reportedly burst into tears in front of the Spanish team as rumours circulate that he has been sacked, with Luis Enrique set to replace him.</p>
      <p>Moreno took the place of Luis Enrique in June after the ex-Barcelona star stepped down in order to look after his daughter, who tragically died in August after suffering with bone cancer.</p>
      <p>According to reports, however, the Spanish FA are set to wield the axe and bring back Luis Enrique in place of Moreno, and <a href="https://www.marca.com/en/football/spanish-football/2019/11/19/5dd32e26268e3e794b8b456e.html">Marca</a> report that both he and the players were in tears after he informed them he would not be continuing as manager.</p>

      <p>Spain beat Romania 5-0 at the Wanda Metropolitano on Monday night, but Moreno allegedly walked out of the stadium without a word to the media after the game, with the players also refusing to comment.</p>
      <p>And according to journalist <a href="https://twitter.com/tancredipalmeri/status/1196568047986847744">Tancredi Palmeri</a> both the players and the manager reacted with shock as news filtered through that Moreno would be replaced.</p>
      <p>He tweeted after the game: "Incredible! Spain squad players leaking unofficially that they were all in locker room post-match talking about game. Manager Roberto Moreno stormed in being in tears, told that he was sacked. They all were petrified, and had even to help him as he felt sick for the emotion."</p>
      <p>It is thought there will a press conference tomorrow to confirm the departure of Moreno and return of Luis Enrique.</p>

      <p>Moreno won four games and drew two as Spain manager since his permanent appointment in June, easily guiding them through Euro 2020 qualification.</p>
      <p>The news amazingly means Spain will have their fifth managerial change since June 2018, when Julen Lopetegui was sacked the day before their opening game in the World Cup after agreeing to join <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> after the tournament.</p>
