      <p>Luis Enrique has returned to his position as Head Coach of the Spanish national team.</p>
      <p>Enrique temporarily stepped down in June to spend time with his family and take care of his sick daughter, Xana, who eventually died in August of bone cancer.</p>
      <p>The assistant coach, Robert Moreno, had been in charge of the team, guiding them through the Euro 2020 qualification.</p>
      <p>“Today we can confirm Luis Enrique returns to his position of work,” RFEF President, Luis Rubiales, said in a press conference at the national team’s training base in Las Rozas.</p>
      <p>Rubiales said Enrique has a contract until the 2022 World Cup in Qatar and that it will be up to him whether Moreno is offered a chance to resume his previous role as assistant coach.</p>
      <p>“Luis Enrique stepped down because of the worst possible thing that can happen to a father,” Rubiales said. “He has always been the leader of our project and he has a contract until (the) World Cup in Qatar,” he added.</p>
      <p>Enrique succeeded Vicente Del Bosque as national team boss following Spain's exit from the 2018 World Cup in the last 16.</p>
