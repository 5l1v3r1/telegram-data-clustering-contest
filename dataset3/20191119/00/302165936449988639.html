      <p>LOS ANGELES, Nov 19 — The release of James Mangold’s <i>Ford v Ferrari</i> and <i>Charlie’s Angels</i> by Elizabeth Banks has overturned last week’s top three, which was dominated by <i>Terminator: Dark Fate</i>.</p>
      <p>Newly out in theatres, the two films have respectively taken first and second place in the world rankings while Joaquin Phoenix stays on with his terror-inspiring <i>Joker</i>, reports <i>ComScore</i>.</p>
      <p>The duo of Matt Damon and Christian Bale has cast a spell over moviegoers.</p>
      <p>Released on November 15 in the US, <i>Ford v Ferrari</i> directed by James Mangold has taken the lead in the world box office rankings on its first weekend in theatres, with more than US$52 million (RM216 million) in sales by Sunday, November 17.</p>
      <p>It is a success that was largely due to the North American market, which accounted for more than US$30 million.</p>
      <p>Kristen Stewart, Naomi Scott and Ella Balinska have come in second with their new mission.</p>
      <p>The latest <i>Charlie’s Angels</i>, directed by Elizabeth Banks, garnered close to US$28 million.</p>
      <p>The reboot also made a strong start on the international market, where it accumulated US$20 million in sales.</p>
      <p>Already third in the world rankings over the last two weeks, Joaquin Phoenix remains in the top three with Todd Philips’ <i>Joker</i>.</p>
      <p>With an additional US$18.6 million harvested over the weekend, the award-winning psychological thriller, which has passed the milestone of US$1 billion in sales, has now accumulated US$1.016 billion.</p>
      <p>On a more sombre note, <i>Terminator: Dark Fate</i> has slid down the rankings from first to sixth place.</p>
