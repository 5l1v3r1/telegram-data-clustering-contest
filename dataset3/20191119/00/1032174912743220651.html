      <p>The summer program has just been announced for the outdoor screen on the rolling lawn behind Cameo Cinemas Belgrave.</p>
      <p>Coming in time for the school holidays are screenings of <i>Frozen 2</i>; a new animated version of <i>The Addams Family</i>; and the Christmas classics <i>Elf</i> and <i>Home Alone</i>.</p>
      <p>One of the biggest film events of the summer is <i>Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker</i>, the final instalment in the “Skywalker” saga that began with <i>Star Wars: A New Hope</i> in 1977. Cameo will screen the film outside when it’s released at 12.01am on Thursday, December 19. The midnight screening will be followed by a full week of screenings.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere on the program you’ll find cult New Zealand director Taika Waititi’s new film <i>Jojo Rabbit</i>, which stars Waititi himself as an imaginary version of Adolf Hitler; Aussie filmmaker Justin Kurzel’s <i>True History of the Kelly Gang</i>; and on David Bowie’s birthday (January 8) there’ll be a screening of the classic creature-feature <i>Labyrinth</i>.</p>
      <p>For the truly twisted, there’s a New Year’s Eve dress-up party and a screening of the new film adaptation of <i>Cats</i> – <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtSd844cI7U">check out the trailer</a> to see what we mean. You’ve been warned.</p>
      <p>
        <i>Cameo Outdoor opens on November 29, 2019. <a href="https://www.cameocinemas.com.au/outdoor-cinema">Tickets and full program here</a>.</i>
