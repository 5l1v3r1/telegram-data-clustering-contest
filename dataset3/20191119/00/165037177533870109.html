        <b>Tottenham Hotspur have announced on Tuesday evening that Mauricio Pochettino has been dismissed as Tottenham manager after more than five years in charge.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Mauricio Pochettino is no longer Tottenham manager</b>, the club have released in a statement. </p>
      <p>"We were extremely reluctant to make this change and it is not a decision the Board has taken lightly, nor in haste. "Regrettably domestic results at the end of last season and beginning of this season have been extremely disappointing," Spurs chairman David Levy explained. </p>
      <p>The news has gone viral on social media and has been received with astonishment by many Tottenham fans.  In fact, the Spurs website was unable to cope with the huge traffic and the entire website was down temporarily. </p>
