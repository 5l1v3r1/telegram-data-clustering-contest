      <p>A joint operation by the security agencies in Kagara in the Northern region has led to the seizure of 73 locally manufactured long guns and a locally-manufactured pistol.</p>
      <p>The operation ‘Kundanlgou’ discovered that the weapons are as deadly as those manufactured outside the country.</p>
      <p>The team also confiscated 83 metal pipes, three hacksaw blades, two hammers, three G-clamps, three iron files and a grinding machine suspected to be used in the manufacturing process.</p>
      <p>Similar arrests have been made in Yendi and Chereponi according to our source.</p>
      <p>The operation Kundanlgou was launched in 2018 along Ghana’s northern borders in collaboration with security agencies in Burkina-Faso, Togo, and Benin to tackle cross-border crimes.</p>
      <p>Some quantities of leaves suspected to be marijuana have also been seized in the operation.</p>
      <p>Four suspects Mahamadu Fuseini, Mohammed Suraju, Yussif Iddrisu, and Abdul-Somed Baba are in custody.</p>
      <p>This is a developing story that JoyNews would be updating as and when new information is made available.</p>
