      <h1>S&amp;P 500 Keeps Rising And Setting New Records</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:16:43+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 00:16</time> by <a rel="author">Ironman at Political Calculations</a></address>
      <p>Summary</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The S&amp;P 500 marked its third consecutive week of closing at new record high values, ending Friday, November 15, 2019, at 3,120.46.</li>
        <li>The level of the S&amp;P 500 is generally consistent with investors either focusing ahead on 2020-Q1 or 2020-Q3 in setting stock prices.</li>
        <li>There's the ever present concern about what the Federal Reserve might do with setting the basic interest rate it controls.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The S&amp;P 500 (Index: <a href="https://us.spindices.com/indices/equity/sp-500">SPX</a>) marked its third consecutive week of closing at new record high values, ending Friday, November 15, 2019, at <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/history?period1=1573455600&amp;period2=1573974000&amp;interval=1d&amp;filter=history&amp;frequency=1d">3,120.46</a>, with healthcare stocks providing the upward momentum to close out the second full week of November 2019.</p>
      <p>Overall, the level of the S&amp;P 500 looks like it is running a bit hot compared to where our <a href="https://politicalcalculations.blogspot.com/2009/04/math-behind-how-stock-prices-work.html">dividend futures-based model</a> is, but since it's projecting a rising trend over the next week, it could be described as simply being slightly ahead of itself.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The level of the S&amp;P 500 is generally consistent with investors either focusing ahead on 2020-Q1 or 2020-Q3 in setting stock prices, although we think 2020-Q3 is the current focus because the <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/equity-index/us-index/sp-500-quarterly-dividend-index.html">projected future dividends</a> expected in that quarter has been rising over the last several weeks.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, there's the ever-present concern about what the Federal Reserve might do with setting the basic interest rate it controls. On that count, the <a href="https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/interest-rates/countdown-to-fomc.html/">CME Group's FedWatch Tool</a> is projecting the investor expectation that the Fed will cut rates by a quarter point during 2020-Q4, but it wouldn't take much to shift the probabilities of such a rate change earlier by a quarter, so 2020-Q3 will very much continue to be a forward-looking focal point for investors.</p>
