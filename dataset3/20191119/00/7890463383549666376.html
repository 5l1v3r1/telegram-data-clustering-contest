      <h1>CS:GO Operation Shattered Web is out now</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:01:59+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 00:01</time> by <a rel="author">Dustin Bailey</a></address>
      <p>
        <b>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive’s next operation is out right now – as if Valve’s announcement of <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/half-life-3/half-life-alyx">Half-Life: Alyx</a> out of nowhere on a Monday night weren’t enough. Operation Shattered Web brings a whole bunch of features to the game, including new maps, agents to unlock, an accolade system to highlight your accomplishments, and a battle pass.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Shattered Web’s progression system is even more battle pass-like than previous operation passes. Your pass will level up with stars that you earn for completing weekly in-game missions, and will give you access to new cosmetics. The new pass is also significantly more expensive this time around – you’ll be able to pick it up for $15 USD.</p>
      <p>Agents are characters that can be equipped on either the T or CT side, and Master Agents spice up the cosmetic options with unique voices and animations – you’ll get one of these special skins for reaching 100 stars. The new operation also features three new weapons collections with designs from community artists.</p>
      <p>Accolades are an Overwatch-style highlight of your match accomplishments, like total assists, MVPs, or enemies flashed.</p>
      <p>Then there are the new maps, like the Flying Scoutsman map Lunacy, and the community’s Danger Zone map Jungle. The competitive side also gets Studio, available for Scrimmage or Casual Sigma.</p>
      <p>You can get more details on the <a href="http://www.counter-strike.net/shatteredweb">official site</a>. It’s been a long time since the last CS:GO operation, but there’s no stopping one of the most venerable and prolific <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/15-best-pc-first-person-shooters">FPS games</a> from continuing its extensive legacy.</p>
