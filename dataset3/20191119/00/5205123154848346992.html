      <p>Joseph McCann, 34, kidnapped the 21-year-old woman as she walked home from Pryzm nightclub in Watford in the early hours of April 21 this year, it is claimed.</p>
      <p>After raping her in her own bed, he claimed she was “one of 15 girlfriends” and scared her by saying he had been in prison, the Old Bailey was told.</p>
      <p>Jurors were shown CCTV footage of the woman leaving the club and walking along the road talking on her mobile phone.</p>
      <p>At 9am that morning, she was captured on video at a BP petrol station in a Ford Mondeo with the defendant.</p>
      <p>Wearing an Adidas T-shirt, cap and jogging bottoms, McCann went into the garage shop alone while the woman remained in the passenger seat of the car, the court heard.</p>
      <h3>'The knife is at my neck'</h3>
      <p>Afterwards, the woman reported being “raped and kidnapped at knifepoint”.</p>
      <p>In a tearful videoed interview played in court, she said: “I was on the phone when it happened.</p>
      <p>“I felt the knife and he put his arm round me so I couldn’t move. The knife is at my neck. I felt it, it was sharp.</p>
      <p>“I dropped my bag first. I still held on to my phone. He told me to shut up and walk to the car.</p>
      <p>“He just kept calling me Hayley at first. Kept saying I’m a ‘stupid girl’. I think he slapped me in the face because I was crying.”</p>

      <p>The woman said he drove around and told her she had to “join the firm”, before taking her back to her flat, where he allegedly raped her in bed.</p>
      <p>Afterwards, the woman said she tried to act normal and “just acted like it was OK”.</p>
      <p>She said: “He kept saying I was one of his 15 girlfriends and I would get on with his wife and kids.</p>
      <p>“He was kind of scaring me saying he just got out of prison after doing 18 years.”</p>
      <p>She said he was wearing a wig and took that off and replaced it with a hat when they got to the petrol station before he let her go.</p>
      <p>The defendant, of Harrow, is charged with 10 counts of false imprisonment, seven counts of rape, one count of rape of a child and two counts of causing or inciting a person to engage in sexual activity without consent.</p>
      <p>He also stands accused of seven counts of kidnap, one count of attempted kidnap, three counts of causing or inciting a child under 13 to engage in sexual activity, three counts of assault by penetration, one count of sexual assault and two counts of committing a sexual offence with intent.</p>
