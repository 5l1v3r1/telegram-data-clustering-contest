      <h1>Troy Parrott Back In The Under 21s Squad For Massive Sweden Clash</h1>

      <p>Troy Parrott wasn't used in the Aviva Stadium last night but might be on full display in Tallaght tonight instead.</p>
      <p>Stephen Kenny has received a massive boost with the news that Parrott will be available to him for tonight's crucial U21 qualifier against Sweden.</p>
      <p>Parrott was an unused sub for Mick McCarthy's seniors at the Aviva last night, freeing him up to be added to tonight's squad. The 17-year-old has scored three goals in his three games at U21 level.</p>
      <p>It's not something that will please the Swedes. They took an early lead against Ireland in the reverse fixture in September, only for Parrott to be brought on, scoring two in a 3-1 win for Ireland.</p>
      <p>Lee O'Connor already rejoined the squad earlier in the week after making his senior debut for Ireland against New Zealand on Thursday night.</p>
      <p>Ireland sit top of the group on 13 points after six games, three ahead of Italy who've played two fewer games. Iceland, who inflicted Ireland's only defeat of the campaign are on nine points after five games while Sweden have six points, having only played three games. A win tonight will be a serious boost to Ireland's qualification hopes, putting some real distance between them and Sweden and Iceland. Ireland will host Iceland and travel to Luxembourg in March, before finishing the campaign in Italy next November.</p>
