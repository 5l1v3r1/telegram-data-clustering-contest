      <h1>Bill on handling of fetal remains passes Pennsylvania House</h1>

      <p>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) - A proposal to require the burial or cremation of fetal remains that end up in possession of a health care facility passed a divided Pennsylvania House of Representatives on Monday after an impassioned debate.</p>
      <p>The bill, which Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf has vowed to veto, was modeled on Indiana legislation that was upheld by the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/us-supreme-court/">U.S. Supreme Court</a> earlier this year. It was sent to the state Senate on a vote of 123 to 76.</p>
      <p>Supporters framed it as giving parents greater say in the disposal of remains, while opponents argued it would harass abortion facilities and impinge on women’s health choices.</p>
      <p>The legislation says parents can decide to dispose of the remains outside a health care facility after an abortion or miscarriage, but if they don’t, the facility must bury or cremate them.</p>
      <p>“We wanted to craft something that was voluntary, that provided the family with the ability for closure, the ability to understand that a human life was lost, their life, that they’d been striving for for so long,” said the prime sponsor, Rep. Frank Ryan, R-Lebanon.</p>

      <p>Rep. Leanne Krueger, D-Delaware, said the proposal would dramatically change state law about what happens after miscarriages and abortions.</p>
      <p>“I dream of a day when we get to vote on bills that respect women and improve women’s health, but today is not that day,” Krueger said.</p>
      <p>Rep. Mary Isaacson, D-Philadelphia, called the measure “yet another attempt to harass abortion providers,” calling it a “mandate, not a choice” that would jeopardize access to health care.</p>
      <p>“The people who treat patients and the patients themselves are telling us this bill is cruel, redundant and poorly drafted,” said Rep. Dan Frankel, D-Allegheny. “It will hurt families during a vulnerable time.”</p>

        <p>But Rep. Kathy Rapp, R-Warren, said the bill would help ease grief and suffering.</p>
        <p>“This bill will give parents the comfort of knowing that they will now have the right to determine the resting place of their child’s remains,” Rapp said.</p>
        <p>All Republicans voted in favor, joined by 15 Democrats.</p>
        <p>Wolf’s spokesman J.J. Abbott said politicians are not elected to tell citizens how to handle “vulnerable and personal situations.”</p>
        <p>“Women and their families are perfectly capable of making these decisions based on their own values and the advice of medical professionals,” Abbott said.</p>
        <p>In May, the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/us-supreme-court/">Supreme Court</a>, with two liberal justices dissenting, let Indiana enforce a requirement that abortion clinics either bury or cremate fetal remains following an abortion. The justices said in an unsigned opinion that the case does not involve limits on abortion rights.</p>
