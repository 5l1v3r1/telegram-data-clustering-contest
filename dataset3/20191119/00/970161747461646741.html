      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/john-barrowman/">John Barrowman</a> heaped praise on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/caitlyn-jenner/">Caitlyn Jenner</a> for choosing to talk about transitioning on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a>… Get Me Out Of Here!</p>
      <p>The former I’m A Celeb finalist was appearing on companion show Extra Camp, when he was asked to share his thoughts on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/caitlyn-jenner-opens-up-about-transitioning-after-threatening-to-quit-im-a-celebrity-get-me-out-of-here-on-day-two-11178492/">Caitlyn’s discussion with her campmates</a> about her life as a transgender woman.</p>
      <p>‘It’s fascinating because obviously Caitlyn’s transition has been a huge thing in her life and [I’m] so glad that she’s finally the person that she was born to be,’ the actor said.</p>
      <p>‘The one thing that I think is great about this also is the fact that on a network TV channel we are watching someone that has gone through that tell that story,’ he continued.</p>
      <p>‘Now, a lot of people might argue that Caitlyn’s a little bit more privileged than others who are going through their transition, yes that’s an argument you can have.</p>

      <p>‘However, not very often do we get to see this, do we get to hear it from somebody on this kind of platform.’</p>
      <p>Using Caitlyn’s story to address larger injustices trans people face in their day to day lives (honestly, we’re obsessed with John), he carried on.</p>
      <p>‘I think this is a game changer for the trans community, the fact that we have her on television.</p>

      <p>‘The trans community at the moment is the part of the LGBTQ+ community that’s suffering because people are attacking them even moreso, so thumbs up for Caitlyn for doing what she’s doing.’</p>
      <p>Big thumbs up to you for talking about it too, John.</p>
      <p>Discussing her transition with her campmates after a tough night at Snake Rock, Cait’s discussion was a touching moment of vulnerability from the Olympian as she spoke about cross dressing in secret for years.</p>
      <p>‘‘I thought I was gonna transition before I was 40,’ she admitted. ‘I didn’t want to be an old chick but this is the latter 80s and I never felt like I fit in anywhere. I was trying to figure myself out, running around town [cross dressing].’</p>

      <p>‘I had, at that time, a turbo Porsche and it was like the day before Halloween and this car pulled up beside me and it’s my next door neighbour.’</p>
      <p>‘How’d you style that one out?’ asked James Haskell, to which Caitlyn replied: ‘I said I was going to a Halloween party.’</p>
