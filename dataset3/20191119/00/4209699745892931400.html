      <p>Advocacy group, Women Arise, has demanded an investigation by the Nigerian government into the death of Mrs Acheju Abuh at the hands of political thugs on Monday in Kogi State.</p>
      <p>Abuh, who was the women leader of the Peoples Democratic Party in the state, was reportedly burnt alive in her residence.</p>
      <p>President of Women Arise, Joe Okei-Odumakin, in a statement said the political thugs, “Poured petrol on the building and set it ablaze as other terrorised villagers watched from hiding.</p>
      <p>“She reportedly attempted to escape through a window but was prevented by the burglar proof and gun shots with bullets raining in her direction.</p>
      <p>“The blood thirsty thugs waited, shooting and watching with relish while Mrs Abuh cried from inside the inferno until her voice died out.</p>
      <p>“They reportedly left only when the entire house and Abuh had been burnt to ashes.”</p>
      <p>Okei-Odumakin called on the government to bring the perpetrators to book.</p>
      <p>She added, “It is our take that these senseless killings continue because perpetrators are not brought to book.</p>
      <p>“If those who killed during the elections had been apprehended, nobody would have had the guts to go and kill post-election.</p>
      <p>“We therefore demand immediate arrest of Mrs Abuh’s killers and their prosecution.”</p>
