      <h1>Social Security Unveils Online Form For Seniors To Report Contacts From Impostors</h1>

      <p>The Social Security Administration published an online form today for seniors to report they have been contacted by persons fraudulently claiming the scammers work for the agency.</p>
      <p>.</p>
      <p>.</p>
      <p>“I am deeply troubled that our country has not been able to stop these crooks from deceiving some of the most vulnerable members of our society,” said Social Security Commissioner Andrew Saul.</p>
      <p>The unveiling of the form came barely a month after Senate Aging Committee Chair Maine Republican Susan Collins complained to Saul in a letter Social Security’s response to impostor scams was lagging.</p>
      <p>She urged the Social Security chief to add staffers in regional offices to handle the increasing number of calls and in-person visits from seniors complaining about the scammers.</p>
      <p>In announcing the form, the agency noted Social Security phone scams are the #1 type of fraud reported to the Federal Trade Commission and Social Security.</p>
      <p>“Over the past year, these scams—misleading victims into making cash or gift card payments to avoid arrest for Social Security number problems—have skyrocketed,” the agency alerted.</p>
      <p>The announcement of the form stressed a real Social Security employee will never tell a senior his or her Social Security number has been suspended and never ask for credit or debit card numbers over the phone.</p>
      <p>The agency also assured Social Security employees will never threaten seniors.</p>
      <p>“If there’s a problem with your Social Security record, Social Security will mail you a letter. If Social Security needs you to submit payments, the agency will provide instructions in the letter, including options to make those payments,” the announcement explained.</p>
      <p>The link to the form is:</p>
