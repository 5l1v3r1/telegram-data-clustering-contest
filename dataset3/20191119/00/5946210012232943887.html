      <p>As the House Intelligence Committee’s <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/11/25/the-sober-clarity-of-the-impeachment-witnesses">public hearings in the impeachment inquiry</a> into Donald Trump enter their second week, several public servants will be called upon to answer questions about allegations that the President withheld security assistance to extract political favors from the government of Ukraine. On Tuesday, four witnesses are scheduled to appear. In the morning, the committee will hear from two people who listened to the now infamous phone call, on July 25th, between President Trump and <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/11/04/how-trumps-emissaries-put-pressure-on-ukraines-new-president">President Zelensky</a>: <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/how-trumps-supporters-distort-alexander-vindmans-very-american-origin-story">Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman</a>, a member of the National Security Council and an expert on Ukraine, and Jennifer Williams, a foreign-service aide in Vice-President Mike Pence’s office. In the afternoon, two witnesses requested by Republicans will appear before the committee: Kurt Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine, and Tim Morrison, a former National Security Council aide. You can watch their testimonies in the live stream above.</p>
      <p>Last week, as <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-trumps-washington/in-trumps-jaded-capital-marie-yovanovitchs-uncynical-outrage">Marie Yovanovitch</a>, the former Ambassador to Ukraine, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/the-political-scene/the-public-stage-of-the-house-impeachment-inquiry">was testifying</a>, Trump tweeted that everywhere Yovanovitch had served—she has been a diplomat for more than thirty years, and worked under six Presidential Administrations—had “turned bad.” Representative Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, who is running the hearings, read the tweets aloud later in the hearing, and said that they amounted to witness intimidation. <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/trump-impeachment-hearings-the-presidents-attempt-to-intimidate-marie-yovanovitch-backfires">David Rohde wrote</a> that the lesson of Yovanovitch’s experience was simple: “Any public servant who gets in the crosshairs of this President will be destroyed by him.”</p>
      <p>In a press conference on Friday afternoon, at which the President called the impeachment inquiry “a disgrace,” a reporter asked whether the statements Trump had tweeted about Yovanovitch were intended to intimidate her. President Trump gave a long reply, meandering away from an answer. When the reporter rephrased her question—“Do you believe your speech and your words can be intimidating, sir?”—he first called on someone else, then ordered, loudly, while pointing at the questioner, “Quiet. Quiet. Quiet!” Then he seemed to change his mind, and answered, in a lower register, “I don’t think so at all.”</p>
