      <p>The National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, has congratulated Yahaya Bello and David Lyon on their governorship election victories in Kogi and Bayelsa States, respectively.</p>
      <p><b>Naija News</b> reports that the <b><a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/18/inec-declares-winner-of-kogi-governorship-election-release-final-results/"><u>Independent National Electoral Commission</u></a></b> (INEC) on Monday, declared the final results and winner of the 2019 Kogi governorship election result.</p>
      <p>According to the results, <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/yahaya-bello/"><u><b>Gov.</b> <b>Yahaya Bello</b></u></a> of the APC polled 406,222 votes to defeat other contestants including <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/musa-wada/"><u><b>Engr. Musa Wada</b></u></a> of the <b>Peoples Democratic Party</b> (PDP) who got 189,704 votes.</p>
      <p>While <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/18/inec-declares-apcs-david-lyon-winner-of-bayelsa-election/"><u><b>David Lyon of the APC was also declared the winner of the Bayelsa Governorship Election</b></u></a>.</p>
      <p>Lyon scored a total of 352,552 votes to defeat his closest rival and candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Nigeria’s main opposition party, Duoye Diri, who polled 143,172 votes.</p>
      <p>Reacting in a statement on Monday by his spokesman, Tunde Rahman, Tinubu said the outcome of the elections show that the people believed in the direction that President Muhammadu Buhari and the APC wish to take this nation.</p>
      <p>Tinubu said: <i>“Their victories stand as a testament to the growing acceptance of our party, the quality of our leadership and governance and the credibility of our promise to lead the people and the nation to the Next Level. It shows that the people have no appetite to return to the failed policies and practices of the past.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“David Lyon’s election represents a significant shift in the politics of Bayelsa State. By voting APC, the people of Bayelsa have voted for progressive reform and Asiwaju joins them in their belief that David Lyon is the man to deliver the needed and desired reform. With this victory, Governor-elect Lyon’s task is to justify the people’s faith by providing a purposeful and transformational administration.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Bayelsa is endowed with significant natural resources and human capital. It will be incumbent on the Governor-elect to harness these assets for the good of all Bayelsans. He must carry along all disparate interests in the state and be magnanimous in victory. Let him reach out to the political opponents who mounted a spirited and energetic campaign. They too must be gracious in defeat.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“For Governor Bello, the people of Kogi have handed him a second term. Their vote is proof of the confidence that the people of Kogi retain in his leadership. He must now re-double his efforts to do even more for the people in his second term.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“The governor must focus on the development of the state as he is the person, more than anyone else, who will determine the fate of Kogi. He must do all he can to realise the potential of the state. He must take advantage of the state’s agricultural richness as well as its proximity to the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja and the commerce resulting from that closeness.”</i>
