        <b>Patrick Kluivert has suggested Matthijs de Ligt feels "sorry" about turning down Barcelona.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Matthijs de Ligt feels a degree of regret about choosing Juventus over Barcelona</b>, according to the Catalan club's director of youth football Patrick Kluivert.</p>
      <p>Juve beat out strong competition to sign Netherlands international De Ligt from Ajax in June.</p>
      <p><b>The defender had been heavily linked to LaLiga champions Barca</b> but opted to sign a five-year deal in Turin after Ajax accepted an offer worth an initial<b> €75million</b>.</p>
      <p>De Ligt was thrust into the starting XI after Giorgio Chiellini suffered a serious knee injury and has faced criticism for<b> conceding two penalties – both for handball – in his nine Serie A appearances</b>.</p>
      <p>Former Netherlands striker Kluivert believes the 20-year-old may now be second-guessing his transfer choice.</p>
      <p>"<b>I would not say I tried to convince him</b>, I could only tell him very good things about both Barcelona the city, as well as the club," Kluivert told Mundo Deportivo when asked about talks he held with De Ligt.</p>

      <p>"<b>But in the end it is the player and his agent who decide</b>. Of course De Ligt is a great defender, but in the end he made a choice. I think he is a little sorry, but it is what it is. In life you make choices and sometimes you do it well and sometimes badly. You have to learn from your decisions."</p>

      <p>Frenkie de Jong, De Ligt's former Ajax team-mate, did make the move to Barca in the close season and has flourished, with Kluivert praising the "very high quality" midfielder.</p>
      <p>Netherlands boss Ronald Koeman coaches both players at international level and has called the Barca job a "possibility" beyond Euro 2020, after which a clause in his contract would allow him to leave for Camp Nou.</p>
      <p>When asked whether Koeman could return to the club as head coach, Kluivert told SPORT: "<b>I don't know, maybe, but I insist, out of respect for Valverde, I don't want to talk about other coaches</b> when there's one in a job at this club."</p>
      <p>He added: "I know Ronald very well. Out of respect for Valverde, I don't want to position myself. [Koeman] is a very good coach, he's doing really well with the Dutch national team."</p>
