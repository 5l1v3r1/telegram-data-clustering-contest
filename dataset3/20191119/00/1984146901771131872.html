      <p>From the Angel of the North to Kielder Water, these are some of the projects given a boost by £1.5billion invested in the North East over 25 years by National Lottery players.</p>
      <p>The equivalent of £170,000 per day has been invested into more than 24,000 good causes in the region over the past quarter of a century.</p>
      <p>To celebrate its 25th birthday, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/lottery">The National Lottery</a> has released a star-studded film inspired by Monty Python entitled ‘What has The National Lottery ever done for us?’.</p>
      <p>Illustrator Ruby Taylor has also created a map highlighting some of the key projects and places in the region that have thrived thanks to National Lottery funding.</p>
      <p>Some of the places showcased include The Angel of the North, which illusionist Julius Dein made disappear in a celebration stunt last month, and The Sage Gateshead, the site of a world record breaking cream tea, hosted by TV personality Scarlett Moffatt.</p>
      <p>There’s also the stunning architecture of Durham Cathedral, which has received money for restoration and building works, the iconic Gateshead Millennium Bridge, part funded by the Millennium Commission, and the rugged landscape of the North Pennines.</p>
      <p>Dawn Austwick, Chief Executive of The National Lottery Community Fund, said: “Twenty-five years ago, saw the advent of The National Lottery – today we’re celebrating what is now a national treasure.</p>
      <p>"The money raised for good causes has helped millions of us follow our passions, find a voice and thrive. Whether through art, sport, community, heritage or film, our lives have been touched and changed - thanks to National Lottery players we are all winners.”</p>
      <p>Ruby said: “I am thrilled to have been asked to design these maps for The National Lottery’s 25th Birthday. It’s easy to forget just how much of an impact that the money from National Lottery players has on our local communities. It was great fun drawing both well known buildings and hidden gems, and I hope that people recognise places that matter to them.”</p>
