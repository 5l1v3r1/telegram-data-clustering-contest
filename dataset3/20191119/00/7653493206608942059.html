      <h1>Wearables To Smash Through Global $100 Billion Ceiling</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.channelnews.com.au/author/elliott-nash/" target="_blank">Elliot Nash</a></address>
      <p>The wearable market is predicted to smash through the $100 billion ceiling by 2023, according to a new industry report that has placed the industry in the ‘growth zone’.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.futuresource-consulting.com/press-release/consumer-electronics-press/wearable-tech-poised-to-break-the-100-billion-barrier/"><u>Wearables Market Analysis and Commentary industry report</u></a> by FutureSource Consulting, the wearable market has managed to escape the ‘general plateau’ experienced by the ‘wider consumer electronics market’ growing from a retail value of $22.5 billion in 2017 to a 2019 forecast of $50 billion.</p>
      <p>Stephen Mears, a Research Analyst at Futuresource Consulting, predicts the wearable market to account for around 10% of all consumer electronics revenues by 2023.</p>
      <p>Futuresource attributes the ‘ever-growing raft of features’ as the reason why tech is moving away from the pocket and onto the wrist or into the ear.</p>
      <p>Currently fitness tracking is seen as a must-have feature in the short term, however, the challenge will be to generate new use cases for wearable technology.</p>
      <p>One such idea has been seen in Google’s collaboration with Levi’s to create a <a href="https://www.channelnews.com.au/google-announce-levis-smart-jacket-for-oz/">smart jacket</a> with gesture controls on the left cuff.</p>
      <p>Integrated smart clothing could be the way of the future, with many technology businesses tinkering with <a href="https://www.channelnews.com.au/ifa-2019-tcl-show-off-premium-smart-glasses/">augmented reality glasses</a>, with baby steps being made by Bose with the <a href="https://www.channelnews.com.au/bose-launch-ar-sunglasses/">AR Sunglasses</a>.</p>
      <p>Smartwatches, in particular, have been central to the current growth, with kids watches identified as an emerging category poised for expansion, with the Chinese market already establishing youth-aimed wearables.</p>
      <p>For the Asia Pacific region, excluding China, a 40% increase by 2023 is forecasted for the wearable market, which will account for 20% of the global market share.</p>
      <p>Curiously the report predicts the increase in market share by the Asia Pacific ‘will come at the expense of China’s share’.</p>
