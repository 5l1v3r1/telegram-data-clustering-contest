      <p><b>(PRESS RELEASE)</b> — Saint Lucia’s Embassy in Taiwan has sent congratulations and best wishes to Keril Victor of Gros Islet who reached the final of one of Taiwan’s most popular TV singing competitions, Jungle Voice.</p>
      <p>Keril is a former student at the National Chengchi University in Taipei, who sings under the stage name Wéi zhé. He is signed up with Taiwan’s premiere jazz musician agency, Kochen Entertainment.</p>
      <p>Jungle Voice is a TV singing competition similar to America’s The Voice. Contestants, both local and international, are assigned mentors from the stars of Taiwan’s music scene and they compete for a chance to be crowned with the title of Taiwan’s next singing star.</p>
      <p>Early this year, Keril was among the 3,000 hopefuls who entered the competition, from whom 80 were eventually selected for the live TV contest, which started in May.</p>
      <p>In the grueling weeks that followed, the numbers were steadily whittled down as contestants were eliminated. But Keril has been able to make it, and secure a place as one of the seven singers who progressed to the finals this weekend.</p>

      <p>His passion for music began at the age of eight when he sang in the choir of his local church. Over the years, his talent and love of singing led him to perform in school and theatre productions as well as national and Caribbean regional events.</p>
      <p>Drawing inspiration from the likes of Brian Mc Knight, John Legend, Michael Jackson and Phil Collins, Keril performs a range of musical styles including jazz, reggae and gospel, and has carried these influences into songwriting and production.</p>
      <p>His most recent single “Running Back” was produced in Taiwan in collaboration with one of the country’s rising young artists, MeloMoon.</p>
      <p>Last month, Keril performed alongside Ronald ‘Boo’ Hinkson &amp; Friends at Saint Lucia’s 40th Independence Anniversary Gala Concert in Taiwan.</p>
      <p>Singing both English and Mandarin Chinese selections in the Jungle Voice competition, Keril’s signature soulful voice and friendly personality won him thousands of Taiwanese and international fans who have followed and supported him on his journey this year.</p>
      <p>A live broadcast of the final will be shared by Taiwan’s ETtoday and its social media platforms on Friday, November 22, 2019.</p>
