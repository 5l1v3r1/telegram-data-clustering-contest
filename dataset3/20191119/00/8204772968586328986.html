      <p>Sir, – Ken Andrew (<a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/letters/boris-johnson-s-walkabout-video-1.4084352">Letters, November 16th</a>) disagrees with Donald Clarke’s description of Boris Johnson’s “casual” election video as “transparently bogus and irresistibly laughable” (“<a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/tv-radio-web/awright-boris-the-meaning-of-boris-johnson-s-walkabout-video-1.4082731">Awright, Boris! The meaning of Boris Johnson’s walkabout video</a>”, Online, November 15th). But how else to characterise Mr Johnson’s distinctly lacklustre performance on the campaign trail so far?</p>
      <p>The British prime minister’s lowlight was at a Somerset primary school when struggling to remember the words to the nursery rhyme The Wheels on the Bus. More seriously, he was unable to give a straight answer to a four-year-old girl who asked him the direct question: “How many children do you have?”</p>
      <p>Despite current strong Tory polling, the opposition parties must be heartened by how strikingly awkward Boris has been when meeting the public.</p>
      <p>Indeed, he’s proving to be a vacuous personality with nothing to offer beyond a blatantly selfish notion of what’s good for himself and the slogan: “Get Brexit Done”. – Yours, etc,</p>
