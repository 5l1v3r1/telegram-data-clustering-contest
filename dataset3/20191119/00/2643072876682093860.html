      <p>The Federal Government of Nigeria has been advised by <b>Prophetess Oluwayemisi Sunday-Ajiye</b>, the founder of God Miracle Success Ministry World Wide, to consider the suffering of Nigerians following the closure of land borders in the country.</p>
      <p>She stated this while speaking during the 2019 annual anniversary and Thanksgiving ceremony of the ministry in Ado-Ekiti, the Ekiti state capital.</p>
      <p>Dignities present during the ceremony include Engr Olajide Borode, Elder Akinlolu Debo, Dr Fasoranti Ademola, Pastor Adedayo Folorunso, Pastor Adeyeye Sola and Engr Olajide Borode.</p>
      <p>The cleric noted the decision of the government to close the border has been affecting businesses of Nigerians since August.</p>
      <p>She further stated that the government must provide an enabling environment for home-grown rice to be patronised.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Government should always consider the plights of the downtrodden in the society when taken sensitive decisions. Our leaders should move closer to God for Him to direct them in governance.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“No doubt, the border closure has affected some persons in their businesses and I want to say again for the government to consider the people. Also, we need more industries so as to help more people to be engaged.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>She charged spiritual heads in the country to be more prayerful and work together in unity in the overall interest of the country, she noted that many Nigerians are looking up to the spiritual leaders for a change in the country.</p>
