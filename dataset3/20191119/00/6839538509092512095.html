      <p>South Australian schools may close as a precaution on Wednesday as the state prepares for a day of catastrophic fire conditions.</p>
      <p>Although Tuesday's weather is not extreme, with temperature in Adelaide is expected a top of 30C, the CFS has issued a statewide fire ban because any blazes that start may not be able to be brought under control by Wednesday when much worse conditions are forecast.</p>
      <p>The mercury is expected to reach 42C in Adelaide, 45C at Ceduna, 44C at Murray Bridge, Whyalla and Port Lincoln, and 43C at Port Pirie.</p>
      <p>"We are putting restrictions on activities on Tuesday to minimise the risk of fires starting, which may not be fully extinguished by Wednesday," CFS chief officer Mark Jones said.</p>
      <p>"A rekindled burn-off on Wednesday would create dangerous conditions for our firefighters so we are not prepared to put them or the community at unnecessary risk."</p>
      <p>If a catastrophic fire danger day is declared, schools and preschools in affected districts will close if they have a risk rating of R1 or R2.</p>
      <p>Bureau of Meteorology acting supervising meteorologist Paul Lainio said several November heat records could fall.</p>
      <p>"Wednesday's forecast for Adelaide at this stage is 42C, just shy of West Terrace's hottest November day in 1962 on November 30 of 42.7C," he said.</p>
      <p>"Across South Australia, temperatures on Wednesday will peak 8-18C above average ahead of a cold front that's accompanied with strong winds.</p>
      <p>"Those towns that may break temperature records are in the south and west of the state and include Victor Harbor, Nuriootpa, Keith, Naracoorte, Murray Bridge and Robe and Lameroo."</p>
