      <h1>Rumours swirl of a Half-Life VR announcement from Valve</h1>
      <h2>UPDATE: It's official!</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:16:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 00:16</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Phillips</a></address>
      <p><b>UPDATE 19/11/19:</b> After 12 long years of waiting, and enough "3"-based memes to fill an entire internet, it's finally official - there's a new Half-Life game on the way. As previously rumoured, it's called Half-Life: Alyx and Valve describes it as the company's "flagship VR game".</p>
      <p>Half-Life: Alyx will be given the full reveal treatment this Thursday, 21st November, at 6pm in the UK/10am Pacific Time. Valve hasn't said where yet, but it seems reasonable to assume it'll pop up on Twitter and will be plastered all over the front page of Steam.</p>

      <p><b>ORIGINAL STORY 18/11/19:</b> A formal announcement of Valve's long-in-development Half-Life VR project looks finally on the horizon.</p>
      <p>Traces of the company's experiments with Half-Life and VR have popped up several times over the years. Indeed, Valve has spoken publicly on the subject.</p>
      <p>In 2015, Valve programmer Jeep Barnett told <a href="http://kotaku.com/yep-valve-is-experimenting-with-half-life-in-vr-1689726340">Kotaku</a> it was dabbling with its best-known franchise in VR just to "see how it fits", with no promise of a game at the end of it.</p>
      <p>And more recently, as Half-Life VR code fragments have popped up in other Valve games, it has been clear the project still exists in some form.</p>
      <p>These are well documented in a 15-minute video essay from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL5RKbiAPqSC_mUIjCpx3xg">Valve News Network</a> creator Tyler McVicker, embedded below. In it, he describes how Valve boss Gabe Newell has talked of a "flagship VR game" on the horizon.</p>
      <p>"When Index was first announced," McVicker says, "a press event was held at Valve and when asked about any Valve VR titles, Gabe Newell stated there would be a 'flagship VR title in 2019'.</p>
      <p>"That title is a single-player story-driven, linear VR first-person shooter set in the Half-Life universe. You play as Alyx Vance, sometime in the 20-year time gap between Half-Life 1 and 2."</p>

      <p>Today, McVicker has published another <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/510025955">video</a> - in response to this morning's rumour that Valve's Half-Life VR project would be formally announced at this year's Game Awards, now for release in March 2020.</p>
      <p>The game is named as Half-Life: Alyx in a leaked transcript of a conversation purportedly between Game Awards and Final Hours host Geoff Keighley and Valve employees.</p>

      <p>"Let's imagine I was given a similar amount of information," McVicker says of the leak in his video today. "Let's imagine, hypothetically, there was a situation where I was given more information than was publicly available on this topic. And I was given a general estimation of when it would publicly release - hypothetically.</p>
      <p>"If I was in this situation where I was given really, really important information about a very near announcement of an incredibly anticipated product... I wouldn't immediately run that story."</p>
      <p>McVicker goes on to - hypothetically - suggest he has an upcoming video on a project (like, say, Half-Life VR) he would - hypothetically - now have to re-record (so it was retitled, say, Half-Life: Alyx).</p>
      <p>The Game Awards take place on 12th December (or early in the morning on the 13th here in the UK).</p>
