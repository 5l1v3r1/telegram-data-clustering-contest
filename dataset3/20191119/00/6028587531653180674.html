      <h1>Here’s What You Need To Know About GMO/Allergen Free ‘Clean’ OTCs</h1>

      <p>As more consumers demand cleaner standards for what they put in their body, it makes sense this movement would spread to pharmaceuticals. Genexa is a company that offers drugs free of GMOs, dyes, and allergens, while still delivering the healing effects. But is this too good to be true, or just a natural advancement in the public’s demand for healthy and clean products? In a perfect world, the pills and serums we take to treat our ailments are filled with drugs proven to heal us and nothing else. But, as you’ve likely realized, we do not live in a perfect world. In most cases, the actual amounts of an active ingredient in a drug is minuscule compared to the entity we consume. Instead, alongside these drugs, medications are also filled with fillers and dyes, to allow the tablets to be large enough to be consumed and to aid with preservation. </p>
      <p>Although Genexa also has fillers and means of preserving the shelf life of their products, they aim to do this in a cleaner way. Think of them as the Whole Foods of the drug world. The brand is marketed as the first over-the-counter medicine free of artificial dyes, flavors, and preservations, without common allergens and harsh fillers. It boasts a line that aims to treat ailments ranging from cold and flu, to jet lag, heartburn, and even pain relievers. </p>
      <p>“We don’t use the unhealthy fillers and binders that are commonly used,” explained Genexa co-founder, David Johnson. “Instead of using talc for example, we use rice brand extract. We use ingredients that are better for you.”</p>
      <p>Even the preservations the team adds to the drugs to boost their shelf life and ward off unwanted bacterial growth are organic. </p>
      <p>Much of Genexa’s line are <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/information-drug-class/homeopathic-products">homeopathic</a>, but for those which are not, the company claims they can be held to the same standards as other OTCs found in pharmacies. This is because although Genexa changes the fillers added to their products, they claim their medications still have the same active ingredients and therefore offer the same benefits as conventional over-the-counter medications. </p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/drugs/types-applications/drug-applications-over-counter-otc-drugs">FDA</a>, their drug monographs work as a sort of recipe book for medications. Genexa has followed these monographs and passed, which means that the medications meet the FDA guidelines for acceptability.</p>
      <p>“A drug marketed that is consistent with the conditions set forth under a final monograph and all other general applicable OTC requirements is considered generally recognized as safe and effective for the uses set forth under the monograph,” an FDA press correspondent confirmed. </p>
      <p>Although he could not specifically speak on the brand Genexa ,according to Paul Nowierski, Sr. Director of Pharmacy &amp; Clinical Services at Lenox Hill Hospital, many times when the FDA recalls a drug, its due to an adverse effect caused by the fillers and dyes, not the active ingredients.</p>
      <p>In other cases, the FDA isn’t even entirely sure what in the drug has caused consumers to get sick, and will end up pulling the product regardless. For example in recall of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/19/health/valsartan-recall-explainer/index.html">Valsartan</a>, the product’s adverse effects had nothing to do with the drug itself but rather an inactive ingredient that was a residual part of the product</p>
      <p>For this reason, Nowierski argues that offering the public an option that has less harmful fillers could do no harm to most, and in fact be especially beneficial to certain members of society who may have specific allergies or sensitivities.</p>
      <p>“As the population grows you also see things that appear that you haven’t seen or recognized before because there is a smaller quantity of the population that may be affected differently,” explained Nowierski. </p>
      <p>Johnson explains that Genexa is about changing the fillers, not the drugs themselves, in order to help consumers.</p>
      <p> “This is about us giving families a cleaner product and a cleaner option when they go to the shelf,” explained Johnson. “People are starting to look at everything they put into their bodies as a whole, whether it is a food, cosmetic or supplement. Consumers are demanding cleaner options and we are the first and only company offering them that in the pharmaceutical industry.”</p>
