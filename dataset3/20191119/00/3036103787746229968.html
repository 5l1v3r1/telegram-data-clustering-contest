      <h1>How many orders Takealot ships each day</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/staff-writer" target="_blank">Staff Writer</a></address>
      <p>Takealot ships an average of 35,000 orders per day – a number which peaks at 80,000 during busy periods.</p>
      <p>This is according to Takealot CEO Kim Reid, who was speaking to media ahead of <a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/black-friday"><b>Black Friday 2019</b></a> and the festive shopping season.</p>
      <p>Over this year’s shopping season, during which time Takealot will hold its Blue Dot Sale, the company expects to ship at least one order every second. This equates to around 10,000 boxes leaving its warehouses every hour.</p>
      <p>To cope with the demand, Takealot is preparing its online and logistics systems accordingly.</p>
      <p>“After expanding our Johannesburg distribution centre, our warehouse storage space now stands at 75,000 square metres,” said Reid.</p>
      <p>“We house over 3.7 million items at any given time, and have opened 47 pickup points in the Eastern Cape, Western Cape, Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, Limpopo, Free State, and Mpumalanga for order collections and returns.”</p>
      <h3>Black Friday traffic</h3>
      <p>Takealot saw a big increase in the number of shoppers who took part in Black Friday 2018 compared to the year before – and expects this growth again in 2019.</p>
      <p>In 2018, Takealot saw simultaneous active users on its site peak at between 70,000 to 100,000, and R196 million worth of transactions take place.</p>
      <p>For 2019, the company is predicting an 80% growth in revenue compared to 2018 – along with a 120% traffic growth.</p>
      <p>Takealot will feature two sales in the coming weeks as part of its Black Friday campaign:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>The Early Access Sale</b>: Runs from 24-28 November, and provides early access to Black Friday deals.</li>
        <li><b>The Blue Dot Sale</b>: A five-day sale which starts on Black Friday and runs from 29 November to 3 December.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>“The Superbalist Showdown will run from 29 November to 3 December, with up to 70% off more than 15,000 items,” added Takealot.</p>
