      </p>
      <p>Sometimes people who tell me that they feel their life is meaningless explain that it is because they have lost, or haven’t attained, something very meaningful. They mention, for example, a physical capability, a close and dear person, a grade sought in college, or a professional goal.</p>
      <p>I am not belittling the pain or disappointment. Such events are indeed very sad and difficult. In some cases what was lost, or wasn’t attained, can’t be replaced or attained at a later date. And in some cases, the pain can’t be ever completely healed. Thus, I think that sorrow, grieving, and frustration are often in place.</p>
      <p>But it’s also important in such cases, after some time in which the feeling of meaninglessness has been sharp and, occasionally, even incapacitating, to see whether <i>other </i>sources of meaning in life can be found. We can continue to be in pain, sadness or frustration without feeling that life is meaningless. These are two different things.</p>
      <p>Sometimes, when we lose or fail to attain something meaningful, we focus exclusively on it. We fail to see that there is, and could be, meaning also in other things. We discern meaning only in what was lost or has not been attained, and then think to ourselves, incorrectly, that there is no meaning at all, so that life is completely meaningless. Oddly, we become utterly blind both to the meaning that already exists in our life and to the meaning that could be found or attained.</p>
      <p>In an excellent recent paper in the <i>Journal of Medicine and <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/philosophy">Philosophy</a></i>, Stephen M. Campbell, Sven Nyholm, and Jennifer K. Walter bring up the notion of <i>surplus of opportunities to attain the goods of life</i>. (The authors also mention an earlier paper by Adrienne Asch and David Wasserman that follows this theme.) Their paper is not specifically about meaningfulness. It focuses on disability and how it relates to the goods of life in general. The authors set out to prove (successfully, in my view) that disabilities needn’t limit access to the goods of life. I cannot discuss here in full this edifying and helpful paper, and will focus only on one claim in it, which relates to surplus of meaning. The authors write:</p>
      <p>It might be thought that such obstacles [that relate to disability] are a barrier insofar as opportunities to secure the goods of life are scarce. However, in most cases there is actually a surplus of such opportunities. … Anyone with access to the Internet has more potential knowledge at their fingertips than any human could possibly digest in a lifetime. Anyone living in a well-populated region is likely to have plenty of opportunities for rewarding relationships … Achievement is a remarkably versatile good given that virtually any activity can constitute an achievement if it is difficult and competently caused. Finally, there are innumerable ways that people can manage to achieve <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/happiness">happiness</a> and pleasure.</p>
      <p>What the authors write is also true of meaning. There are many ways of attaining meaning. Unfortunately, however, some people become focused so strongly on only one source of meaning in their lives that if it is lost or can’t be attained, they fail to see other sources of meaning that already exist in their lives and the opportunities to attain meaning from further, alternative sources. Seeing that meaning could be found in a variety of ways does not conflict with grieving, sadness or frustration. We can be very sorry for what we lost or didn’t attain, yet accept that that person or thing needn’t be the <i>only</i> source of meaning in life. We can be sorry <i>and</i> have a very meaningful life.</p>
      <p>As a child, I was often told a joke about the person who, although he had a lot of bread and a lot of butter, died of hunger because he didn’t have a knife to slice the bread and spread the butter. Although he was very hungry, indeed he was starving, he refused to nourish himself with the bread and butter unless he could do so “properly,” or in the only way he was used to, that is, by using a knife to slice the bread and to spread the butter. Similarly, some of us are starved for meaning, sometimes to the point of dying. Let us not be like that person. Let us accept that there are many different ways of finding, connecting to or creating meaning in our lives.</p>
