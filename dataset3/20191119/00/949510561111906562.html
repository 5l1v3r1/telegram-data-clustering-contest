      <p>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — With the launch of her new memoir, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley has again ignited speculation she may be gearing up for a possible White House bid, perhaps as early as 2024.</p>

      <p>Haley has been navigating that balancing act since 2016, when there was initially no love lost between then-governor Haley and then-candidate Trump.</p>
