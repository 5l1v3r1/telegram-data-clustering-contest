      <p><b>after four years of development, <a href="https://www.unocup.com/">unocup</a> launches on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/unocuptogo/unocup-the-new-foldable-paper-coffee-cup/description">kickstarter</a> to bring its sleek, foldable design to shops and restaurants, creating a cleaner, healthier earth.</b> in new york city alone, nearly 1.5 billion coffee lids are discarded annually — only a fraction of the 412,500 pounds of plastic lids ultimately thrown into the ocean. this impact still does not include the cost and energy spent on manufacturing, storage, and transportation. the design team — kaanur papo and tom chan — develop the disposable unocup with both the consumer and business owner in mind. while the simplicity of its integrated design means less material to produce, order, and responsibly discard, coffee-drinkers can contribute to a cleaner earth without changing their habits.</p>

      <p><b>while eliminating the plastic lids that contribute to the tens of millions of pounds in plastic waste generated annually, consumers can still enjoy the on-the-go convenience, even better than before.</b> kaanur papo and tom chan rigorously design the foldable unocup to elevate the experience of the traditional paper coffee cup. since its 2015 conception, the team has run with, shaken, and stirred each of the 800 following prototypes, ensuring the ultimate design’s spill-resistance. ergonomically, unocup’s curved drinking spout fluidly guides beverages while traditional plastic lids feature a rigid opening that often feels unnatural.</p>
