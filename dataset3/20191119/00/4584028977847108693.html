      <p>Rick Carlisle declared Luka Doncic "can do anything he wants on a basketball court" after he inspired the Dallas Mavericks to a 117-110 defeat of the San Antonio Spurs.</p>
      <p>The Slovenian prodigy conjured up a career-high 42 points, 11 rebounds and 12 assists in a magnificent display at American Airlines Center on Monday.</p>
      <p>Doncic became the second-youngest player in NBA history to rack up a 40-point triple-double, with only his idol LeBron James having achieved the feat earlier in his career.</p>
      <p>Mavericks coach Carlisle said: "This guy can do anything he wants to on a basketball court. He's having one of those magical runs right now.</p>
      <p>"It's a phenomenal thing to watch. It's a phenomenal thing to be a part of."</p>
      <p>Forward Doncic said: "It feels like every day there are stats you don't know about, stats that you read about. It's great to hit."</p>
      <p>Dallas are 8-5 after winning two in a row, while the struggling Spurs have now lost six on the spin and are languishing at 5-9.</p>
      <p>Spurs shooting guard DeMar DeRozan said: "When adversity hits, you can't run from it, you can't shy away from it, you can't let it get you down.</p>
      <p>"Try to channel that energy and put it in the right place so we can understand why we got beat."</p>
