      <h1>UFC Hall of Famer Chuck Liddell defends Mike Tyson street fight comments: He wouldn’t be able to stop the takedown</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Mckeever</a></address>
      <p>Chuck Liddell’s recent comments about <a href="https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/11/14/20964226/ufc-hall-of-famer-chuck-liddell-in-a-street-fight-against-mike-tyson-i-win-boxing-mma-news">beating Mike Tyson in a street fight</a> didn’t go down too well with the combat sports community, so the former UFC light heavyweight took to Twitter to explain his position.</p>
      <p>Responding to fan criticism on social media, ‘The Iceman’ wanted to clarify a few things.</p>

      <p>“Look 1) I’m talking about when we were fighting 2) I’d take him down so he’d have one shot on my way in 3) I’m a big fan of mike and have no desire to fight him. But hypothetically speaking, when we were fighting, yes I would’ve beat him!” Liddell wrote.</p>

      <p>“I remember Tyson and I’m a huge fan of his but I’m not sure why biting Holyfield’s ear off makes him a better street fighter or better at stopping takedowns?”</p>

      <p>“He won’t get three minutes I’d shoot right away. He had no ground training or takedown defense training at all. So he’d have to catch me on the way in or he’d never get off the ground period!”</p>
      <p>Liddell, who turns 50 next month, makes some valid points, but Tyson was much bigger, faster and stronger than all of Liddell’s previous opponents and the former heavyweight boxer was — and still is — widely considered the ‘baddest man on the planet’. Tyson possessed ferocious power in both hands and had an unrivalled aura during his peak.</p>
      <p>Even at 53, Tyson is still in phenomenal shape and moves incredibly quick for a heavyweight.</p>
