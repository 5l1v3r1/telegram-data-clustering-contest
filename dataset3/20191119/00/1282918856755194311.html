      <p>Union Youth Affairs and Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju has said that a committee will be formed for sports federations to run efficiently. The Minister said a sports code that will be acceptable to all will also be bought. He also said, only people who have the knowledge and administrative skills will be allowed to run federations and parameters will also be set. </p>
      <h3>'We will bring the Sports Code'</h3>
      <blockquote>"We will form a committee for the Sports Code. This committee will be very credible. After the recommendation of the committee, I can say anything. We will bring the Sports Code, which will be acceptable to all. We cannot ignore anyone from society. If I say to a particular group member that you can't be a sports federation head that will be not good. In sports, only those can run (federations) who have the best knowledge of good administrative skills, accountability, transparency, and governance. These are the three parameters on which we will see, who can run sports federation in democracy," he added.</blockquote>

      <h4>New Sports code rejected</h4>
      <p>Earlier, the Indian Olympic Society rejected the new National Sports Code draft and also questioned many articles that are part of the newly crafted draft. The new sports code was drafted in 2017 and proposed changes to the 2011 draft. 2017 draft proposed for Members of Parliament and legislative assemblies to be barred from holding office in the National Sports Federation and the IOA. </p>
      <blockquote>"IOA said they don't accept the old draft of Sports Code. So we will bring a new draft. After the consultation of all, we will bring a new Sports Code, Since I assumed the office, I have informed all the federations not to indulge in any kind of unnecessary fight, which has a negative impact on sports and athletes. I don't want any sports federation to act like this and get suspended," Kiren Rijiju said.</blockquote>
      <p>India bagged a total of nine medals including two gold, two silver, and five bronze, and recorded their best-ever performance in the World Para Athletics Championships that concluded last week in Dubai. The minister said he is excited to see the Para-athletes perform well in the games and also assured that the ministry will extend all possible help to all four categories including the regular Olympics, the Paralympics deaf, Special Olympics, and Paralympics. </p>
