      <p>Former Finance Minister Seth Terkper has raised concerns over portions of the 2020 budget statement read by finance minister Ken Ofori-Atta last week.</p>
      <p>Mr. Terkper said the extension of temporary taxes for five years by the government is unheard of.</p>
      <p>Analyzing the budget with Francis Abban on the Morning Starr Tuesday, he said “temporary taxes extended for 5 years is unheard of. It shouldn’t be the case and should never happen.”</p>
      <p>“Under Ex-President Rawlings, when the economy went down, temporary taxes were introduced on the revenue side. When there is recovery, taxes were taken off,” he indicated.</p>
      <p>“We are told we are on a path of unprecedented fiscal consolidation meanwhile that is not the case”.</p>
      <p>On flagship projects of the ruling government he said “flagships should have given us breakdowns. We should know how much is going into food, classroom blocks among others.”</p>
      <p>“We’re not in the 2016 situation where there are power crisis and the like and so we expected much more,” he ended.</p>
