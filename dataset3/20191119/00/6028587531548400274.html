      <p>WWE Raw’s go-home show saw both NXT and SmackDown Superstars crash the show on the road to Survivor Series. Paul Heyman announced Brock Lesnar’s match against Rey Mysterio will be no hold’s barred, while the main event saw The Viking Raiders take on Randy Orton and Ricochet for the WWE Raw Tag Team Championships in yet another match that ended with an interpromotional brawl.</p>
      <p>By night’s end, Triple H issued a challenge to stars of both Raw and SmackDown to show up Wednesday night on NXT.</p>
      <p>Last week’s edition of Raw sunk to its lowest non-holiday total in modern history.</p>

        <b>WWE Raw Results: Monday, November 18, 2019</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Becky Lynch and Charlotte Flair def. The IIconics</b>
      </p>
      <p>Poor Dio Maddin might have been permanently F-5’ed right out of commentary. Keep in mind that Roman Reigns once kicked out of five of those things.</p>
      <p>Peyton Royce’s husband, Shawn Spears, works for AEW. I don’t know how much time is left on her contract, but one day I’m sure fate will bring them together so they can tread water as one.</p>
      <p>If you watch the main roster and not much NXT, at least you know that these NXT men and women can run really fast.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Humberto Carrillo def. Karl Anderson</b>
      </p>
      <p>Beating Karl Anderson after spending several weeks losing to AJ Styles is the quintessential definition of “too little, too late.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Bobby Lashley def. No Way Jose</b>
      </p>
      <p>Even No Way Jose seems like he’s above this feud.</p>
      <p>Lana had a few gaffes while trying to say Rusev couldn’t come within 90 feet of her, but she recovered masterfully by saying Bobby Lashley makes her flustered.</p>
      <p>As an enhancement talent with zero future in WWE, it feels like only a matter of time before No Way Jose tweets out his request for a release.</p>
      <p>It is too late in this feud, let alone Bobby Lashley’s career, for the man to be getting over a new finisher.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Seth Rollins def. Andrade via Disqualification</b>
      </p>
      <p>At one point, Vic Joseph was talking about the Twitter feud between Andrade and Seth Rollins, and he noted “of course Andade started this Twitter feud,” <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alfredkonuwa/2019/06/24/seth-rollins-believes-wwe-has-the-best-pro-wrestling-on-the-planet-calls-out-anybody-who-disagrees/">as if the notion of Seth Rollins starting a Twitter feud is preposterous.</a></p>
      <p>This is a great on-paper matchup but boy did these two have chemistry issues throughout.</p>
      <p>I think Bobby Lashley and Lana have more onscreen chemistry than these two did.</p>
      <p>The Lucha Heel Party will be missed when it’s gone in a month.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Buddy Murphy def. Akira Tozawa</b>
      </p>
      <p>Given the dark, brooding setting of Aleister Black’s promos, I always assumed the door to his locker room was made out of aging wood.</p>
      <p>If this match had any semblance of crowd engagement it very well may have been the best TV wrestling match of the week.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Erick Rowan def. Alex Malcom</b>
      </p>
      <p>At what point does Rowan’s mystery creature get its own theme music?</p>
      <p>The Singh Bros. are just out here trying to win the WWE 24/7 Championship and they suddenly found themselves getting mauled during a jobber match. That’s essentially the story of this belt.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Kevin Owens vs. Drew McIntyre</b>
      </p>
      <p>This came off as Triple H going to Kevin Owens because Seth Rollins said no. He almost delivered the same pitch, word-for-word.</p>
      <p>The finish of this match was essentially Triple H’s music.</p>
      <p>If enough #Raw stars keep telling Triple H no, it'll get to the point where he’ll be telling No Way Jose “<i>you</i> and your dance moves were the lifeblood of NXT!”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Paul Heyman Issues “No Holds Barred” Challenge to Rey Mysterio</b>
      </p>
      <p>Paul Heyman wore a Yankees tie to address this Boston crowd from an undisclosed location but these people still loved him.</p>
      <p>Rey Mysterio is a great father to Humberto Carrillo, and that’s not even his son.</p>
      <p>I have a fleeting feeling Brock Lesnar will break Rey Mysterio’s steel pipe in half.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Asuka vs. Natalya</b>
      </p>
      <p>It’s worth noting Samoa Joe has been excellent on commentary and Dio Maddin should be thanking his lucky stars that this man’s current injury is only temporary.</p>
      <p>This match doubled as WWE’s apology to Asuka for booking her to tap out to Natalya.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Randy Orton and Ricochet vs. The Viking Raiders</b>
      </p>
      <p>I feel sorry for anybody who waited around to see who Randy Orton’s mystery partner would be and got Ricochet.</p>
      <p>The Viking Raiders seem to get a meaningful win once a month and tonight was one of those nights.</p>
      <p>Half of me expected a <a href="https://www.wrestlinginc.com/news/2019/11/randy-orton-responds-to-tony-khan-wwe-saudi-arabia-tweet-662382/">Tony Khan run-in at some point.</a></p>
      <p>The Survivor Series buildup has only given WWE an excuse to have non-finishes in every other match.</p>
