      <p>Organizational and social psychologists point to whistleblowing as important for upholding moral and ethical standards in groups, organizations, and society. Psychologist Farid Anvari and his colleagues say that while whistleblowing may create instability in the short run, in the long run it can be critical for an organization’s prosperity and survival.</p>
      <p>Our laws also acknowledge the value of whistleblowing. This is why a variety of<a href="https://www.whistleblowers.org/know-your-rights/"> laws</a> protect the right of people to report wrongdoing without <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/fear">fear</a> of retaliation.</p>
      <p>Whistleblowers feature prominently in the Ukraine scandal, making it a good time to think about psychological research on whistleblowing, and how it might apply.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Personal Costs Often Prevent Whistleblowing</b>
      </p>
      <p>One thing we know is that despite its social and organizational benefits, whistleblowers face considerable personal costs such as attacks on their reputation, job loss, intimidation, and marginalization. These costs often prevent whistleblowing.</p>
      <p>It’s interesting to consider this in the context of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/president-donald-trump">President Trump</a>’s reactions to the Ukraine scandal whistleblowers. Almost daily, Trump demands the <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/identity">identity</a> of the whistleblower that first reported the concerning circumstances around the withholding of Ukraine aid. He regularly uses Twitter (where he has 66 million followers) to question the credibility and reputations of witnesses and whistleblowers. Regardless of the President’s intent, it’s likely these public criticisms of whistleblowers and witnesses have increased the perceived personal costs of coming forward with information detrimental to the President.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Loyalty Norms Affect the Likelihood of Whistleblowing</b>
      </p>
      <p>We also know that when norms for loyalty dominate a group or organization, whistleblowing is less likely because reporting wrongdoing feels like a betrayal. Additionally, a whistleblower who reports to <i>outsiders</i> about fellow <i>insiders</i> is branded a traitor, a rat, a snitch, or a backstabber. Loyalty can increase the costs of whistleblowing.</p>
      <p>Research confirms that a close relationship and loyalty to the wrongdoer both reduce whistleblowing. <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2018/03/06/donald-trump-loyalty-staff-217227">President Trump once said</a>, “I value loyalty above everything else—more than brains, more than drive, and more than energy.” The value the President places on loyalty to him is reflected in his hirings and firings, and in his tweets. While we can’t speak to his underlying motivations for prioritizing others’ loyalty to him, the practical result is that if there were wrongdoing, we would expect the loyalty of his political appointees to offer him some protection from their whistleblowing.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Group Identifications Matter in Whistleblowing</b>
      </p>
      <p>When faced with wrongdoing in their group or organization, people have choices. They can:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Stay and try to change the group from within.</li>
        <li>They can <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/conformity">conform</a>.</li>
        <li>They can leave.</li>
        <li>They can blow the whistle, which they usually do by first using internal channels, and if that’s ineffective, by going outside the group or organization to a regulatory body, or the media.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Whistleblowing is more likely to happen when the actions of the group violate the values of another important group identity. Then it becomes an act of loyalty, honor, and justice, rather than an act of betrayal. This appears relevant to impeachment whistleblower witnesses Vindman, Hill, Yovanovitch, Kent, and Taylor. These witnesses indicated that their public servant roles prioritize a non-partisan duty to the country and U.S. security interests and that this was the context of their sharing their concerns about the withholding of U.S. aid to Ukraine.</p>
      <p>When the offense directly victimizes a person or group with whom a person identifies, whistleblowing is also more likely. Consistent with this, Yovanovitch, Kent, and Taylor are long-serving members of the State Department. All expressed concerns about Trump and Giuliani’s circumventing of State Department diplomats and established diplomatic channels, and the unusual circumstances surrounding Trump's removal of Yovanovitch from her position as the U.S. Ukraine Ambassador.</p>
