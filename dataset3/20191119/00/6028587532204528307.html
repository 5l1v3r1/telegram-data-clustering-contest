      <h1>Latest Samsung Details Reveal Surprising New Galaxy Phone</h1>

      <p><a href="http://www.samsung.com/">Samsung</a> may be planning to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2019/11/11/samsung-galaxy-s11-screen-samoled-trademark-new-screen-details-spec-launch-date/">tweak the screen on the upcoming Galaxy S11</a>, but a recently published patent suggests that the South Korean company has even bigger plans to shape a new screen around your next smartphone.</p>

      <p>The new details come from a patent published on November 7 2019 for “display apparatus and portable terminals”. It covers a new shape of screen and the addition of UI elements. <a href="https://nl.letsgodigital.org/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-one-telefoon/">Ilse Jurrien reports for Let’s Go Digital</a> (who have supplied the concept image above):</p>
      <p>"The enclosed images show a smartphone with a flat screen and four curved display parts, which are arranged on all sides of the device. As a result, this Samsung Galaxy smartphone has an extra large display surface that covers almost the entire side of the device.</p>
      <p>"Three of the four sides show a 90˚ angle. Only at the bottom is a slight bend applied, which, incidentally, extends just as far as the other three sides. In addition, an antenna is incorporated in the display on both the top and bottom.”</p>
      <p>It is perhaps asking too much that this technology will show up in the Galaxy S11 handsets that are expected to be launched during February 2020. The design of those handsets will be locked in and presumably a number of test units are being tested in South Korea, and the current leaks suggest that the Galaxy S11 will be shrinking the bezels and moving the selfie camera to a central punch out hole. There’s nothing as radical as a ‘3D Display’ here.</p>

      <p>Later in the year, though, that’s possible.</p>
      <p>Samsung of course has two ‘flagship’ product launches each year - the Galaxy S during Q1, and the Galaxy Note during Q3. There has been <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2019/10/02/samsung-galaxy-s10plus-s10e-note10-note10plus-camera-dex-night-mode-update-upgrade/">a little chatter that the Galaxy Note range is nearing the end of its practical branded life</a>. One suggestion is that it would be rolled into the S range, after all the Note 10 and the S11 Plus have very few points of difference (the major one being the S-Pen stylus). <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2019/09/17/samsung-galaxy-s11-note11-cancellation-upgrade-galaxy-s10-note10-plus/#693f52fd4e7f">The other is that both the S and the Note would combine to create a new brand, the Galaxy One</a>.</p>
      <p>Presumably this model would take over the Note’s mid-August launch spot. If so, that would be the first moment where I would and include the 3D display and side-touch controls discussed in this patent. Naturally being a patent there is no guarantee that the product will reach market, but the patent matches up with the upcoming trends around display technology, the edge controls in Samsung’s One UI, and it would offer Samsung Display a new product to sell to other manufacturers.</p>
