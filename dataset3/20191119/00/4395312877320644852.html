      <h1>Dietician Says This Will Be the Biggest Diet of 2020</h1>
      <h2>What will the dieting landscape look like as the new decade begins?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thriveglobal.com/authors/cw-headley/" target="_blank">CW Headley</a></address>
      <p>On behalf of<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/us-weight-loss-market-worth-66-billion-300573968.html"> the roughly 97 million active dieters</a> that contribute to the <a href="https://www.theladders.com/career-advice/why-diets-dont-help-you-lose-weight-according-to-a-nutritionist">infamously indecisive weight loss industry</a> every year, Ladders began our interview with renowned dietitian,<a href="https://nutritiouslife.com/"> Keri Glassman,</a> MS, RD, CDN, by asking if it is actually possible to canonize an official one size fits all <a href="https://www.theladders.com/career-advice/this-trendy-diet-may-be-the-key-to-slow-ageing-fight-diseases-and-burn-belly-fat">diet</a>? Or if she reasoned that a person should consult with a nutritionist to optimize results? Surprisingly, Glassman doesn’t think you have to do either in order to be healthy. In her estimation, securing a successful personalized diet is as simple as learning how to “listen to your body.”</p>
      <h3>Remixing the fundamentals</h3>
      <p>There are many routes and byways to up-keeping your proverbial temple but some basics need to be established first and foremost. Ladders inquired what those might be in Glassman’s privileged estimation.</p>
      <p>“Whole grains, fruits, veggies, proteins, healthy fats, and dairy,” Glassman explained to Ladders. “Basically whole, real foods define an overall healthy diet. Consistently following a healthy diet isn’t a black or white thing. It’s all about learning to tell the difference between hunger, cravings, and thirst.”</p>
      <p>If you’re like me, you might be surprised to learn that the contrasts that distinguish thirst and hunger are extremely subtle ones. When our normal fluid levels drop by a mere 1% to 2% the symptoms that signal this often closely resemble hunger pangs.  What you end up with over the course of a 24-hour day are intermittent periods where we’re either eating or not eating for the wrong reasons: boredom, miscommunication, or poor self-control.</p>
      <p>“Generally speaking, a person should be eating three meals a day with two snacks for when they feel a little hungry,” Glassman told Ladders.</p>
      <p>It’s perfectly healthy to eat whenever you feel even a little bit hungry. In addition to the whiplash, trend diets encourage us to think meanly of eating. Eating is a vital, culturally and socially significant experience. It’s okay to revel in it and customize it and even possible to do both while being able to fit into your levis.</p>
      <p>To this, Glassman’s celebrated school of thought intends on wounding the last line of defense that stands between public perception and the conclusion <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/blog/2018/rising-obesity-united-states-public-health-crisis">of a national obesity crisis.</a> It’s not that people don’t know how bad sugar and processed meats are for them, it’s more that not enough are aware of the panoply of worthy alternatives that are currently available.  Dispelling cultural classics like a bowl of cereal and a Cheeseburger with fries is a formidable task, which is why Glassman has devoted a reasoned effort to amending the hits as opposed to doing away with them wholesale.</p>
      <p>For example, everybody loves a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, “but really what you’re getting is sugar and sugar and then unhealthy fats and sodium,”  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dP9Wbz3qAcg">Glassman explained to People.</a> Her alternative retains all the essential flavor profiles of the traditional snack while maximizing each’s nutritional potential.</p>
      <p>You start by ditching the processed white bread, which is packed with additives, and replacing it with sprouted grain bread, which is lower in carbs, higher in protein and fiber in addition to boasting a much lower glycemic index compared to other breads. Next, you swap the peanut butter for almond butter or even natural peanut butter. Both are incredible sources for healthy monounsaturated fats and vitamins. Lastly, instead of jam consider fresh fruit that you can either slice or mash, to top your nutrient-loaded power snack.</p>
      <h3>The future of diet science</h3>
      <p>“Younger generations are more aware today. That’s why they’re leaning more toward personalized  plant-based diets,” said Glassman <a href="https://www.allure.com/story/millenials-obsessed-with-health-and-wellness">of the frequently reported Millennial-specific </a> fixation with health fads.</p>
      <p>One of the most exciting predictions from the erudite dietitian regarding the future of diet trends was that the future of dieting sort of requires its votaries to abstain from diet trends. <a href="https://adage.com/article/cmo-strategy/power-plant-based-food/317167">National polls and surveys</a> suggest a burgeoning custom of cherry-picking the essential parts of the acclaimed submissions in accordance with interception and a general adherence to greens. A person that is taking up a diet with their cognitive well-being in mind, for example, would do well to consider anti-inflammatory foods according to Glassman, “anything that contributes to a healthy gut community, “think yogurt, cheese, dairy, nuts.” Remember, how quickly you lost weight as a result of  a particular regimen says nothing about its sustainability.</p>
      <p>If your druthers command a buzzy name for the dietary horizon, Glassman motioned the <b>flexitarian diet</b> on several occasions. Essentially though, the diet is just a chic way of referring to a sober health-conscious personalized diet. A flexitarian is a mostly-vegan that occasionally consumes meat or fish.  Ultimately, as far as disease prevention and longevity is concerned, nothing really beats a plant-based diet. We’ve known that for some time. The newest addition simply states, excluding moral reasons and preexisting conditions, enhancing an otherwise vegan diet with limited meat intake might be advisable-environmentally and somatically.</p>
      <p>Returning for a moment to Glassman’s philosophy of reanimating standards in service of overall health, adding a touch of animal protein to the already vibrant plant-based diet, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhJ5Ti558zQ">extends the canvas that much more.  Every food group has its role to play in delaying our march back to the maggots though living longer shouldn’t be the only concern of a diet plan. </a>Listening to your body commands one to condition a harmonious liaison between our culinary wants and needs.</p>
      <p>“Flexatarian, I’m a big fan of it,” Glassman<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb-bC8CJSNo"> told <i>Today</i> a year ago,</a> when she first suspected the trend to take hold of Millennials and Gen Zers going into the 2020’s. “You are a vegan most of the time. You’re eating lots of vegetables, and healthy fats from nuts and seeds but when you want to have maybe a piece of grass-fed steak or even just a piece of steak at a restaurant, or you want to have eggs, you can. It allows room for these other kinds of food without being so hardcore.”</p>
