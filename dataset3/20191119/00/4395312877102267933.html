      <p>Quiet introvert, I see you as you are… sensitive, smart, a thinker… But you’re feeling bombarded by all the things you’re juggling in your life, and you’re feeling bombarded by all the “shoulds” that come from outside yourself. Those shoulds are now also pinging around in your head and keeping you up at night.</p>
      <p>So you feel hesitant to move forward. Maybe you’re unsure how having a business will work for you – how you’ll manage your energy if you have to show up in the world so much.</p>
      <p>And because of all that, you’re hiding your light. You’ve gone quiet. And that doesn’t feel good either.</p>
      <p>So you say, “I should just suck it up and get out there – even if it makes me feel so depleted that I need three days to recover. Even if I don’t enjoy it. Even if it makes me kind of hate my business.”</p>
      <p>You know you have gifts and talents and expertise the planet needs. You know there are people praying for the help you know you can give them…</p>
      <p>The world needs to hear your voice. The world needs to see your light.</p>
      <p>But you have a big problem. As an introvert, you aren’t wired to do the world like extroverts are. Your brain wiring is optimized for thinking, not doing. You’re wired for the life of the mind.</p>
      <p>So the big question is: How can you stand out in the world to share your gifts, talents, and expertise with the same level of enthusiasm and feeling of empowerment that extroverts (who are wired for doing the outer world) enjoy?</p>
      <p>The answer is to stop trying to force yourself to move forward with strategies that favor extrovert brain wiring – doing things that are inside the extrovert’s Comfort Zone – and instead operate from your own Comfort Zone. <b>Identify the people, places, situations, and skillsets that make up your Comfort Zone, and then come up with comfortable, creative ways to reach your goals.</b></p>
      <p>You CAN show up and shine your light and share your unique voice comfortably in a world made for extroverts – on your own terms!</p>
