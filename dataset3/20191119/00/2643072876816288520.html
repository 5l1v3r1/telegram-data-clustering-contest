      <h1>Rivers APC: Stop Blackmailing Tinubu, Apologise To Amaechi – Eze Warns</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Enioluwa Adeniyi</a></address>
      <p>A chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress, <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/eze-chukwuemeka-eze/"><u><b>Eze Chukwuemeka Eze</b></u></a>, has warned Senator <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/magnus-abe/"><u><b>Magnus Abe</b></u></a> to stop blackmailing the National Leader of the party, Bola Tinubu, whom he constantly link with his actions in Rivers State.</p>
      <p>Eze while making his position known about the crisis in Rivers APC stated that Senator Abe is blackmailing the former Governor of Lagos State to justify his actions in the state.</p>
      <p>Eze further stated that Abe’s dealings have denied the party and Rivers people their constitutional and democratic right of choosing who governs them.</p>
      <p>The APC chieftain in a statement said the activities of Abe against the ruling party can only be described as deliberate sabotage of genuine efforts to liberate the people of the State from the hold of a diabolic manipulator and bad governance.</p>
      <p>He said, <i>“We have watched with dismay the continued linking of Senator Bola Tinubu to the satanic plot to decimate the party and her structures in Rivers State, by a group of unconscious and conscienceless mortals, led by Senator Abe.”</i></p>
      <p>Eze claimed that the former lawmaker has extended his actions against the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, and threatening some journalists with a sack by reporting them to the APC national leader for publishing some of his political actions.</p>
      <p>Eze who described Tinubu as a nationalist, seasoned democrat and patriotic leader, and an individual whose political structure is not anchored on falsehood, illegality, sabotage and anti-party scheming, said Senator Abe has continued to embark on mischievous ventures in an effort to damage the strength of APC in the state.</p>
      <p>He charged the former lawmaker to apologise to Amaechi and the Rivers state chapter of the party, he added that no political party will add him to their fold, considering the way and manner he has carried himself as a political Judas Iscariot in recent times.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Even Governor Nyesom Wike who has been the highest beneficiary of his political selfishness and idiocy is keeping him at arm’s length”.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Eze expressed displeasure over the act of the Management of Vanguard Newspaper for succumbing to Senator Abe’s pressure and intimidation by rendering him an apology, over an interview granted by Prince Lucky Worlu and titled, “Rivers APC chieftain urges Buhari to unite Amaechi, Abe,” merely aimed at pleading with Mr President to intervene and restore peace in the Rivers State chapter of the APC and devoid of any malicious content.</p>
      <p><i>“There is nothing wrong with a call for peace within the party and only a conflict entrepreneur like Senator Abe will object such a noble move. This has further shown that Senator Abe is more determined, now than ever, to wreck the ship of the Rivers APC for no just cause and must be swiftly resisted”</i>, Eze warned.</p>
      <p>Eze charged newsmen to stand by the truth and not bend to the threat of Abe and those in his school of thought who think that by intimidation, the press can be caged.</p>
