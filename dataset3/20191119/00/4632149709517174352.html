      <h1>Kasavanahalli Lake’s walk path is caved-in no more</h1>

      <p>The pathway around Kasavanahalli Lake that had caved was levelled on Monday. Out of the 2.5 km pathway stretch around the lake, around one kilometre had been dug by contractors from Larsen &amp; Toubro, who had taken up the Cauvery water pipeline laying work of Bangalore Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) almost a year ago. <br/><br/><br/>After the work, the muddy pathway had been left uneven and partly dug up, making it dangerous for walkers and animals. <br/><br/>Last week, Bangalore Mirror had written about how a portion of the pathway had dangerously caved in. The contractor from L&amp;T who had taken up the Cauvery water pipeline laying work said, “We sent a JCB and a roller on Monday to level the pathway. We have levelled the entire 70-metre-stretch that had caved in. Now there are no potholes or uneven stretches near the lake. I will visit the site soon to inspect the quality of work.” <br/><br/><br/>Siva Pagadala,a lake volunteer said, “The BM report led to some action as the craters have been fixed now. We hope that the path remains levelled now. It is safe for walkers now. The boundaries too have been fixed.”</p>
