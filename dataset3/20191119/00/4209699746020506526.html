      <p>A dismissed police inspector, Ogunyemi Olalekan, has been remanded at the Ikoyi Prisons after his arraignment at an Ikeja High Court.</p>
      <p>Olalekan is being tried for the murder of Kolade Johnson, a 35-year-old man, at a viewing centre in Lagos.</p>
      <p>Olalekan and three other officers were on illegal duty when the officers shot sporadically in the act.</p>
      <p>Johnson was hit and died on the spot.</p>
      <p>Olalekan, 45, denied the charge of murder levelled against him during his arraignment.</p>
      <p>At the arraignment, the prosecution informed the court that Olalekan, who worked with the Special Anti-Cultism Squad, committed the offence at 5:10pm on March 31 at Onipetesi Estate, Mangoro, Lagos.</p>
      <p>“The former police inspector unlawfully killed Johnson by shooting him with an AK47 rifle in the lower abdomen.</p>
      <p>“The offence contravenes Section 223 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State 2015,” said the prosecutor.</p>
      <p>Lagos State Director of Public Prosecution, Mr Yhaqub Oshoala, asked the court to continue to remand Olalekan at the facility.</p>
      <p>This case has been adjourned to January 15, 2020 for trial.</p>
