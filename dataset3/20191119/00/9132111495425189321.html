      <p>The General Secretary of the National Democratic Congress (NDC), Johnson Asiedu Nketia, is accusing the chairperson of the Electoral Commission, Ghana (EC), Jean Adukwei Mensa, and one of her deputies, Dr Bossman Eric Asare of being affiliates of the New Patriotic Party (NPP) given their actions and decisions.</p>
      <p>In an interview with Winston Amoah on Sunrise on 3FM Tuesday, Mr Asiedu Nketia readily cited the position of Dr Bossman Asare on the referendum as evidence of his assertion.</p>
      <p>The Deputy EC Chair was on same programme on Monday and personally canvassed for a ‘Yes’ vote in the December 17 referendum.</p>
      <p>Mr Asiedu Nketia said this flies in the face of law as a Deputy Commissioner, who has to serve as a referee, takes a side already.</p>
      <p>He continued by citing how the whole country was aware of the tension between the NDC and Jean Mensa before her appointment as the EC chairperson.</p>
      <p>She was Executive Director of the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) before her appointment.</p>
      <p>“The NGO she ran went to organize a programme that was openly against NDC,” Mr Asiedu Nketia said.</p>
      <p>“We complained about it, she came to insult us and because of that we withdrew our participation from the NGO.”</p>
      <p>He further linked this to her appointer, President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, terming him a “dictator”.</p>
