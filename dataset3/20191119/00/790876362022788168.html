          <p><b>1. Check in with your friend or loved one to see if they're okay.</b> If you're concerned that someone you know may be dealing with stress, reach out and ask them how they're doing. This can not only give you a better idea of what's going on with them, but will reassure them that you care about them and are thinking about their wellbeing.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Say something like, “Hey, you've seemed kind of anxious and tired lately. Is everything okay?”</li>
            <li>
              <p>If they're not in the mood to talk about it, respect their wishes. Just let them know that you are there if they ever want to talk.</p>

They may be looking for practical solutions, or they may just want to vent or even find a distraction from their worries. Instead of rushing to try and solve their problems, ask them for guidance about what you can do.<sup><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Help-Someone-with-Stress#_note-3">[3]</a></sup></p>

                      <p><b>4. Listen to them if they want to talk.</b> Sometimes just talking it out can help stress feel more manageable. If your friend or loved one says they want to talk, <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Actively-Listen">listen actively</a> to what they have to say. Let them do most of the talking, and resist the urge to jump in or offer suggestions unless they ask you to.<sup><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Help-Someone-with-Stress#_note-4">[4]</a></sup></p>

                        <li>Be empathetic and ask them questions to let them know you're listening and encourage them to reflect. For example, “Wow, that must have been tough. How did you feel when he said that?”</li>
                        <li>Don't be afraid to ask for clarification or rephrase what they are saying to make sure you understand them. For example, “So, it sounds like you're feeling really overwhelmed with school work and also having some tension with your girlfriend. Is that right?”</li>
