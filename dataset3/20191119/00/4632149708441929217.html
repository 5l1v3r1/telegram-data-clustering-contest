      <p><i>The residence address of the city Commissioner of Police still reads as Infantry Road instead of Bhagavan Mahaveer Road</i> <br/><br/>The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) renamed the Infantry Road as Bhagavan Mahaveer Road in 2004 but not many offices and buildings, including the Office of Commissioner of Police, are ready to accept the change, if the signage on the road is any indication. <br/><br/>For example, the residence of Commissioner of Police was renovated when the then Commissioner of Police Alok Kumar vacated the residence, the authorities concerned have also put up a new name board on the compound wall but forgotten to change the name of the road to Bhagavan Mahaveer Road. <br/><br/>“Why do the BBMP authorities want to change the names of historical roads in Bengaluru? The BBMP authorities have changed the name of Residency Road to Field Marshal Cariappa Road and Richmond Road as General Thimmaih Road a few years ago but how many buildings have changed the name of these roads in the name boards? It will be useful to give these names to the roads at newly developed layouts,’’ said Kathyayini Chamaraj, Executive Trustee, CIVIC Bangalore. <br/><br/>Stating that public memory cannot be erased by renaming the roads in the city, Srinivas Alavalli, a member of Citizens for Bengaluru, has said people had accepted the change of Bangalore to Bengaluru since it was the original name of the city. “Infantry Road has its own history and importance. British infantry was stationed on this road. Earlier, MG Road was called as Parade Road. It is very important to take people into confidence by the authorities concerned before effecting the change of names for roads in the city,’’ opined Srinivas Alavalli.</p>
      <p>Public memory can’t be erased by changing names. It is very important to take people into confidence before effecting changes</p>
      <p>–Srinivas Alavalli, member of Citizens for Bengaluru<br/><br/>Coming down heavily on Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagar Palike (BBMP) for changing the names of the roads with a vested interest, HM Venkatesh, a social activist said changing the names of the roads serves no purpose. “Recently, I have opposed the state government’s plan to rename Indira Canteens as Kempe Gowda Canteens to have more footfalls. I think the plan to rename Indira Canteens was taken to please a certain community. It’s a classic case of vote bank politics. The authorities concerned have no special love towards Kempe Gowda or any other leader or religion,’’ said Venkatesh. <br/><br/>A few years ago, the 100 ft Road in Indiranagar was renamed as Dr SK Karim Khan Road and the 80 Feet Road as CV Raman Hospital Road but not many people are aware of it. The decision to change the name of Frazer Town to Pulakeshi Nagar, Richmond Town to Sir Mirza Ismail Nagar, Austin Town to F Kittel Nagar, Benson Town to Kadamba Nagar, and Double Road to Kengal Hanumanthaiah Road too has not gone down well with the people of Bengaluru. <br/><br/><br/><b>The process</b> <br/>The corporators have to make a representation to the BBMP Joint Commissioner asking for change of the name of a particular road. The Joint Commissioner forwards the request to the BBMP Council where a decision would be taken. After receiving the BBMP Council nod, the BBMP advertise it in the newspapers inviting objections. Later, the proposal again sent to the BBMP Council for approval and finally sent to the State Government for approval.</p>
