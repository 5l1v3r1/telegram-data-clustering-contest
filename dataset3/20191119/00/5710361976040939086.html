      <p>A very broad index is testing last year’s highs as monthly momentum is creating lower highs. Which indicator is more important, price or momentum?</p>
      <p>This chart looks at the <b>New York Stock Exchange Index (<a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/nyse-composite">NYSE</a>)</b> on a monthly basis over the past 15 years.</p>
      <p>The index peaked in January of 2018, as momentum was the highest since the peak in 2007.</p>
      <p>The rally off the lows around Christmas last year has the index testing the highs of January 2018. While the rally has taken place over the past 12 months, lofty momentum has created a series of lower highs.</p>
      <p>Can you believe that this index has lagged the <a href="https://www.investing.com/indices/us-spx-500">S&amp;P 500</a> since June of 2008?</p>
      <p><b>Bottom line:</b> Price is the only thing that pays. If this lagging index breaks above last year’s highs, it would send the S&amp;P a bullish message.</p>
