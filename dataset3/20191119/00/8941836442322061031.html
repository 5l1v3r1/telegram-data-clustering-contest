      <p>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/microsoft/">Microsoft</a> says that its own workplace collaboration service Teams now has more than 20 million daily active users.</p>
      <p>That’s 8 million more than what upstart work messaging service Slack boasted of having last month. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/microsoft/">Microsoft</a> is in a fierce popularity contest with Slack.</p>
      <p>Slack, which had its initial public offering in June, was in a federally-mandated quiet period when <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/microsoft/">Microsoft</a> first revealed its Teams metrics in early July.</p>
      <p>Slack has since gotten louder about downplaying the numbers, saying users are more engaged with its customizable service than “legacy suites of badly connected products” - a thinly veiled swipe at <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/microsoft/">Microsoft</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/microsoft/">Microsoft</a> benefits from being able to bundle Teams as part of a software package that includes email and other products.</p>
