      <p>Carmelo Anthony says joining the Portland Trail Blazers feels like the "perfect opportunity" to resurrect his NBA career.</p>
      <p>The veteran forward is expected to join the Trail Blazers ahead of their road match-up with the New Orleans Pelicans on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Anthony, 35, has been out of the league since he was waived by the Chicago Bulls back in February and last played a game in November 2018 for the Houston Rockets.</p>
      <p>The 10-time All-Star is determined to grasp his opportunity now he has secured his return.</p>
      <p>The veteran forward said in a YouTube clip: "I always kept my eye on Portland. It just didn't work out at other times. But now it seems like a perfect opportunity.</p>
      <p>"I just look at that team and say, 'This is what I can bring, this is where I can help'. It can only work if all parties see it the same way.</p>
      <p>"What happened before is the past; I can't dwell on that. I learned from that.</p>
      <p>"This happened at a point of time in my life where I do have a lot of clarity and understanding of different situations, just life. My approach is totally different."Portland made the Western</p>
      <p>Conference Finals last season but are struggling at 5-9 this time around and lost 132-108 to the Rockets on Monday.</p>
