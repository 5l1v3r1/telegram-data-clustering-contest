        <i>A roundup of what The Globe and Mail’s market strategist Scott Barlow is reading today on the Web</i>

      <p>BMO economist Doug Porter warns that storm clouds are on the horizon for domestic manufacturers,</p>
      <p>“The household survey suggests a cooldown is coming (where manufacturing jobs were up just 0.2% y/y in October). Similarly. U.S. factory employment is up just 0.4% y/y as of October. Tuesday brings Canadian manufacturing sales for September, always a key piece of the puzzle for monthly GDP. We look for sales to have dropped 0.8% m/m, reversing the August rise, and leaving them down more than 2% y/y”</p>
      <p>The domestic economy has been remarkably resilient in the face of a slowing global economy but this trend is being challenged.</p>

      <p>Citi’s “Global Theme Machine” is my favourite of the Wall Street thematic investment reports.</p>
      <p>The most recent update sees U.S. defence stocks as the top-performing theme for 2019 so far,</p>
      <p>“We see a fair bit change, however, with a number of Themes breaking into the Top Quintile: new joiners include #6-ranked Defence (up from #17), #9 Virtual Reality (#21) tied with Smart Grids (#35), #11-ranked Wearable Tech (up from #27), #12-ranked Consumer Health &amp; Wellness (#29), #15 Cloud Computing (#23), and #16 Urbanisation (#25)… Bottom Quintile sees far less change, with just 1 Theme – #78-ranked China Tourism Spend (3 months prior was #59) – newly falling into this quintile vs 3 months prior. Agricultural Tech, Deepwater, Biotech, Light-Weighting of Cars, &amp; Immunotherapy all comprise the Bottom 5 Themes, in ascending order. .. In terms of overall 2019 year-to-date the strongest performing Theme is #6-ranked Defence, +30.8% vs MSCI World’s +21.2%”</p>

      <p>Also from Citi, Montreal-born U.S. equity strategist Tobias Levkovich analyzed the top holdings of the country’s actively managed mutual funds,</p>
      <p>“Health Care and Information Technology were preferred at 50 of the top mutual funds and hedge funds in 3Q19. For 50 actively managed mutual funds, Health Care names represented 19.6% of the most common top-ten holdings in 3Q19 compared with 2Q19’s 15.1%. IT names comprised 18.3% of the top-ten positions of 50 mutual funds in 3Q, versus 17.1% in 2Q. Similarly, hedge funds’ weightings displayed a preference for Information Technology (18.8% of the largest 50 top-ten equity positions in 3Q versus 18.5% in 2Q) and Health Care (17.7% of the top-ten equity positions in 3Q versus 18.9% 2Q”</p>
      <p>For hedge funds specifically, most widely held stock are (in order), Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp., Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.</p>
