      <p>I am often asked this question.</p>
      <p>The short answer is yes.</p>
      <p>But you deserve a longer answer from me. You see, I’ve embarked on a project to develop a fool proof system to double one’s income.</p>

      <p>But I also acknowledge that it's challenging to be an investor these days. If you open the newspapers bad news will come pouring out at you.</p>
      <p>Car sales are crashing. Rural India is in distress. People are losing jobs. GDP is going down. Even Rs 5 biscuits aren't selling!</p>
      <p>How do you think of investing in the stock market at such a time?</p>
      <p>A friend of mine who is a doctor told me the other day he stopped his equity SIPs. I did not find this surprising. When the economy looks rough, and there’s bad news all around, stocks are considered 'risky'.</p>
      <p>In such times, even a minor decline in the market scares away many investors. They either head for the exit or stay away for a long time. This is what’s happening today. People are not falling head over heels to buy stocks.</p>
      <p>But this is a mistake!</p>
      <p>
        <b>The greatest irony of the stock market</b>
      </p>
      <p>Legendary investor Benjamin Graham used to say – "The investor's chief problem and even his worst enemy is likely to be himself."</p>
      <p>It's not very difficult to see why.</p>
      <p>Every investor in the stock market wants to buy low and sell high. Yet, we have a situation where when the market was at its highest in 2018, investors were tanking up on stocks. Stock tips from a barber were enough for them to go out and buy.</p>
      <p>Today, when hundreds of individual stocks are selling for so much lower, they are dumping them and staying away.</p>
      <p>But what about the economic slowdown, you ask?</p>
      <p>Well, what of it?</p>
      <p>When your airplane hits a turbulent patch, you should put on your seatbelt. You don't jump off the airplane, do you?</p>
      <p>It’s the same with your stocks too.</p>
      <p>The way I see it, the Indian economy has hit a rough patch. Whatever the reasons may be, it is as normal as an airplane hitting a patch of turbulence.</p>
      <p>It’s no reason to jump out of stocks, especially when so many of them are trading cheap.</p>
      <p>This is why, for my <i>Double Income</i> project, I don’t let the slowing economy come in the way of my decision making.</p>
      <p>In fact, I’ve back tested my <i>Double Income</i> strategy for many years. I am fully confident it can withstand this tricky phase of the market and come out on top.</p>
