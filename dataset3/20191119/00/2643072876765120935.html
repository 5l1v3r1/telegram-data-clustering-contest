      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Gbenga Sijuade</a></address>
      <p>The Archbishop of Canterbury, <a href="http://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/11/serap-appeals-to-archbishop-of-canterbury-over-continuous-detention-of-sowore/"><u><b>Most Revd Justin Peter Welby</b></u></a> has acknowledged the letter sent by the <b>Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project</b>, (SERAP) urging him to prevail on <b>President Muhammadu Buhari</b> to obey court orders involving activists <a href="http://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/17/falana-list-3-ways-dss-contradicted-itself-while-giving-reasons-for-sowores-detention/"><u><b>Omoyele Sowore and Olawale Bakare</b> </u></a>who remain in arbitrary detention despite a court order for their release.</p>
      <p>Speaking on behalf of the world leader of the <a href="http://www.naijanews.com/2017/06/28/anglican-church-ask-buhari-resign-incapacitated/"><u><b>Anglican Communion</b> </u></a>through an email, <b>Dominic Goodall</b>, the Chief Correspondence Officer at the Lambeth Palace revealed that the letter was received by the archbishop through him.</p>
      <p>Goodall’s email read in part: “<i>Thank you for taking the time to share your comments and concerns on this matter, which have been noted. Please be assured that I will communicate your concerns to the Archbishop and his staff team, so that they are aware of your concerns. Thank you again for taking the time to write.”</i></p>
      <p>Reacting, Kolawole Oluwadare said: “<i>We are very delighted that our letter and the concerns that it raises have caught the attention of the Archbishop. Given his public record for justice and human rights, we have absolutely no doubt that he will prevail on President Buhari to obey not just the court order for the release of Sowore and Bakare but all court orders.”</i></p>
      <p>“But it should never have reached this level, as the government ought to have obeyed court orders as a matter of routine”</p>
      <p>In the letter dated 11 November 2019, SERAP had said: “<i>We believe you can use your leadership position and influence to persuade President Buhari to promote the rule of law in words and in action by obeying all court orders including the order for the releasing of Mr Sowore and Mr Bakare from arbitrary detention.”</i></p>
