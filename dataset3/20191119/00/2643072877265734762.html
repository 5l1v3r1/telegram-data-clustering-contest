      <p>The spokesperson to the UNGA, Ms. Reem Abaza, who made this known in a statement said that Bande is coming home to attend to a meeting of the Stakeholder Group on Ageing Africa (SGA Africa).</p>
      <p>The meeting, according to Abaza, is the region’s expert conference on the human rights situation of older persons for the purpose of strengthening the protection of their rights.</p>
      <p>Muhammad-Bande is also expected to mobilise support for multilateralism and rule-based systems “as the most potent avenues for fostering dialogue and proffering solution to global problems’’. He is also expected to underscore the importance of international cooperation in sensitizing national governments on the human rights situation of older persons in Africa.</p>
      <p>The President of the UN general assembly will also seize the opportunity of his visit to thank the government and people of Nigeria for their support prior to and after his election and inauguration as President of the 74th Session of the GA. He will also visit the recently reconstructed UN house before departing Nigeria on Nov. 25.</p>
