      <p>Struggling English Premier League (EPL) side Tottenham Hotspur have announced the sacking of manager Mauricio Pochettino.</p>
      <p>Spurs are currently languishing in 14th place in the Premier League following a poor start to the season which has left them 20th points behind leaders Liverpool.</p>
      <p>Pochettino’s coaching staff Jesus Perez, Miguel D’Agostino and Antoni Jimenez have been relieved of their duties.</p>
      <p>Speaking on the sack, Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy said: “<i>We were extremely reluctant to make this change and it is not a decision the Board has taken lightly, nor in haste.</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“Regrettably domestic results at the end of last season and beginning of this season have been extremely disappointing.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“It falls to the Board to make the difficult decisions – this one made more so given the many memorable moments we have had with Mauricio and his coaching staff – but we do so in the Club’s best interests.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Mauricio and his coaching staff will always be part of our history. I have the utmost admiration for the manner in which he dealt with the difficult times away from a home ground whilst we built the new stadium and for the warmth and positivity he brought to us. I should like to thank him and his coaching staff for all they have contributed. They will always be welcome here.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“We have a talented squad. We need to re-energise and look to deliver a positive season for our supporters.”</i>
