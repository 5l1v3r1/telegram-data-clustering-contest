      <h2>The Conservative hopeful vowed to clear his name and claimed he had never held anti-Semitic views as past comments he made about Holocaust denier David Irving came to light.</h2>

      <p>The Conservative candidate for Aberdeen North has been suspended by the party after comments he made several years ago on an online forum emerged.</p>
      <p>The Scottish <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/conservative-party">Conservatives</a> said it had withdrawn its support for Ryan Houghton, while condemning "all forms of Islamophobia, homophobia and anti-Semitism".</p>
      <p>Houghton said the National newspaper had taken a "selective look" at comments he made in discussions about terrorism, LGBT rights and anti-Semitism and vowed to clear his name.</p>
      <p>He said that in the discussions seven years ago, when he was 20, he referenced the views of discredited historian and <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/holocaust-survivors-who-fled-scotland-12642931">Holocaust</a> denier <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/nazi-sympathiser-holocaust-gave-secret-9807301">David Irving</a> but had made clear in subsequent posts that he was not defending them.</p>

      <p>Houghton said in a statement on Monday evening: "I apologise unreservedly for any hurt now caused by these comments and have been in contact with members of the Jewish Community in Aberdeen."</p>
      <p>He said he had "never held anti-Semitic or intolerant views".</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives said: "The comments contained in these blogs are unacceptable and Mr Houghton has been suspended as a member of the Scottish Conservative party as a result.</p>
      <p>"The party has also withdrawn its support for his candidacy in Aberdeen North.</p>
      <p>"The Scottish Conservatives deplore all forms of Islamophobia, homophobia and anti-Semitism."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Houghton said following his suspension: "As a party we have been quick to call out the comments by others and should act equally swiftly when an allegation of a similar kind is made against one of our own members."</p>
      <p>While saying he was saddened by the newspaper's "reluctance to apply analysis to the context of a discussion", he said: "I will fully cooperate with the investigation by the party and look forward to clearing my name."</p>
      <p>Kirsty Blackman of the SNP won Aberdeen North at the 2017 general election and is defending the seat next month.</p>
      <p>Blackman took 41% of the vote in 2017 with Labour's Orr Vinegold in second place on 30% with Tory candidate Grace O'Keeffe coming third on 23%.</p>
