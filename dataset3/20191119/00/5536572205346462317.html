      <p>Dean Spanos is not a popular man among the Los Angeles Chargers’ fan base.</p>
      <p>The Chargers owner made an appearance at an NFL event for the buildup to the Chargers’ Monday Night Football game against the Kansas City Chiefs in Mexico City. Spanos was introduced to the gathering of fans and he got loudly booed by fans there as one guy could be heard yelling, “San Diego.”</p>

      <p>Spanos was the engineer behind the Chargers moving from San Diego to Los Angeles, where the franchise has found it hard to find a fan base to come out and support the team during home games.</p>
      <p>This is just yet another incident as to why the team should’ve stayed put.</p>
