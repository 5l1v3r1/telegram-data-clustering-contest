      <p>Kuwait’s ruler on Tuesday named Sheikh Sabah al-Khalid al-Sabah as prime minister, elevating him from his role as foreign minister, after a row between ruling family members and parliament prompted the last government to resign.</p>
      <p>Emir Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah initially tapped caretaker premier Sheikh Jaber al-Mubarak al-Sabah to form a new cabinet but he rebuffed the offer on Monday, citing a media campaign against him.</p>
      <p>The government resignation came after lawmakers sought a no-confidence vote against the interior minister and as a dispute between senior officials, including the interior and defence ministers, over alleged mishandling of public funds went public.</p>
      <p>The state news agency KUNA said Sheikh Sabah al-Khalid, who has been Kuwait’s foreign minister since 2011, was sworn in in front of the emir hours later.</p>
      <p>The oil policy of the OPEC producer, which is set by a supreme petroleum council, and foreign policy, which is steered by the emir, are unlikely to change under the new government.</p>
      <p>Kuwait, an ally of the United States, has the most open political system in the Gulf Arab region, with a parliament wielding power to pass legislation and question ministers.</p>
      <p>Corruption allegations led to public protests earlier this month outside parliament, for which elections are expected to be held next year.</p>
      <p>The Kuwaiti prime minister traditionally helps navigate the often tense relationship between parliament and government. The emir has the final say in state matters.</p>
      <p>In a televised address on Monday, the 90-year-old emir warned the media and public against discussing an issue that was being addressed by the judiciary, saying the state would safeguard public funds.</p>
      <p>Power struggles between senior ruling family members have often played out in parliament. Cabinet resignations happen frequently when elected lawmakers are set to question or submit a no-confidence vote against senior government officials.</p>
      <p>“I suspect the impending parliamentary elections are pressing some of these royal rivalries to the surface,” said Kristin Smith Diwan, senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington.</p>
      <p>“Royal politics and parliamentary politics are intertwined, due to the power the parliament holds through the constitution to approve the appointment of the crown prince,” Diwan said.</p>
