      <p><b>Topline</b>: Swedish prosecutors have dropped their investigation into an allegation of sexual assault made against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange in 2010.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The 48-year-old, denies the allegation, but took refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London for seven years to avoid extradition to Sweden over the case.</li>
        <li>The Australian activist was evicted from the embassy in May is currently being held in Londonâ€™s Belmarsh prison for 50 weeks for breaking bail set in 2012.</li>
        <li>His fate had been torn between Sweden and the U.S., both of which had attempted to get him extradited to face different criminal charges. He now faces being sent to the U.S.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Crucial quote</b>: Deputy chief prosecutor Eva-Marie Persson said in a <a href="https://www.aklagare.se/en/news-and-press/press-releases/?newsId=3265699">statement</a> on Tuesday: "I want to inform about my decision to discontinue the preliminary investigation."</p>
      <p><b>Key background</b>: Prosecutors in Sweden had been investigating allegations of rape against Assange until they dropped the case in 2017 and reopened it after he was arrested earlier this year. Meanwhile, lawyers for the U.S. government have been fighting to extradite Assange to the States to face trial for conspiracy to commit computer intrusion, and face extra charges of breaching the Espionage Act by publicising classified information through WikiLeaks.</p>
