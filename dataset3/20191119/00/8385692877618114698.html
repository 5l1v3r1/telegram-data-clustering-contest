      <p>Samsung appears to be preparing to launch a brand new variation on its Samsung Galaxy A80 that includes more storage for photos, videos, and apps.</p>
      <p>That's based on a recently <a href="https://themrpc.com/samsung-galaxy-a80-256gb-variant-surfaced-on-teena-may-launch-soon/">spotted</a> listing with China's TENAA â€” a functional equivalent to the U.S. FCC. The listing not only showcases the handset in a high-shine dark gray coloration. The listing shows at a lighter silver-like hue at the top and bottom edges. It also outlines the specifications, leaving little doubt this will be an upgraded Samsung Galaxy A80.</p>
      <p>The biggest change worth noting is that this particular version of the upper-mid-ranger packs quite a bit more storage than its current counterparts. In fact, it ships with twice the storage at 256GB.</p>

      <h3>Is storage all that's different for this Samsung Galaxy A80?</h3>
      <p>Aside from storage changes, the rest of the specs sheet for the new Samsung Galaxy A80 appears to be configured identically to the present version. That suggests this is a variation on that same gadget. This is not a successor to the device Samsung launched <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2019/04/samsung-galaxy-a80-rotating-camera-launch.html">back in April</a>. But that's not necessarily anything to scoff at.</p>
      <p>One of the aspects of the relaunched Galaxy A series that makes it so appealing is that it comes with a similar camera setup to Samsung's flagships. Or at least the cameras are similar in terms of capability, according to Samsung. In fact, the entire setup with the newly-consolidated series is meant to both test new features and emulate those flagships at a lower cost.</p>
      <p>For the cameras, that extends to include the selfies with the device in question. Because the Samsung Galaxy A80 actually uses its primary camera for selfies, more storage than usual is needed on that front too.</p>

      <p>The handset ships with a 48-megapixel-rated triple rear sensor array at the back. In that, Samsung packed a 48-megapixel f/2.0 aperture coupled with an ultra-wide 8-megapixel snapper. The latter camera has a 123-degree field of view and an aperture at f/2.2. The final sensor is a 3D depth sensor. But the entire thing flips up and over to serve for selfies. That all means higher-quality photos and arguably requires more storage for the Samsung Galaxy A80 than it might otherwise need.</p>
      <h3>What exactly are those specs and how will this affect the price?</h3>
      <p>In terms of other specifications, the newly-spotted Samsung mid-ranger comes with Android 9 Pie, driven by an octa-core processor clocked 2.2GHz for two cores and 1.8GHz for six further cores. Samsung backs that with 8GB RAM. A 25W-fast charging 3,700mAh battery powers that package.</p>
      <p>That's the same configuration found on the current device, arguably one of the best mid-range devices on the market. Samsung packs all of that in under a 6.7-inch FHD+ resolution display 1080 x 2400. A fingerprint scanner sits just below the glass. There are almost no bezels surrounding that display in the 65.2 x 76.5 x 9.3mm frame since the cameras are all on the rear panel instead of embedded under or above the screen.</p>

      <p>One other big change for this gadget will undoubtedly be in its pricing. <a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/category/samsung">Samsung</a> sells the current Galaxy A80 at a retail right around $667. With double the storage, it will certainly cost more if and when Samsung launches the 256GB version of the handset. While there are still no official price details, for the time being, the price shouldn't jump too much since every other spec is staying the same.</p>
