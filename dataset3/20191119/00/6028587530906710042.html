      <p>The John Cooper Works GP is <a href="https://www.mini.com/en_MS/home.html">MINI</a>’s most exclusive road car. Inspired by the marque’s motor racing side, this little fast car is made to a limited 3,000 numbers as a mix of track and road cars. The GP series, which began 2006, is an exercise in showing how far the marque can push its motorsports credentials without losing the unique modern MINI touch. This third and latest car is fast and a little furious, offering zero to 62mph in just 5.2 seconds and top speeds of 164mph from the 2.0-litre 4-cylinder engine, with the TwinPower Turbo Technology delivering 306 of horsepower and 450 Nm of torque.</p>

      <p>And there are plenty of racecar visual hints here: the wide track, large front apron, pronounced spoiler and, most striking of all, rectangular wheel arches of recycled carbon fiber. The GP recalls key visual classics from the modern MINI too, such as the round headlights and hexagonal radiator grille. These work well with the John Cooper Works elements, such as the hood scoop in the bonnet, hexagonal honeycomb grille with the GP logo in the radiator grille and tailpipes and double tailpipe.</p>

      <p>Inside the sporting theme continues with an all-black cabin and speckles of red. There is a new digital display on the steering column with key information in the driver's direct vision. This GP is imagined purely as a fun car, a sporty toy car, so there are no rear seats to maintain the lowest possible weight. It is also a niche product and as such provides a great canvas for exploring the exciting design and manufacturing ideas the brand is working on. This includes the complex 3D printing technique that created the carbon elements inside and out which allowed for the car’s serial number to be engraved in each car.</p>

      <p>“The Mini was revolutionary,” says the marque’s current design director, Oliver Heilmer. I am interested to know more about the GP, but also where he hopes to take the brand forward in terms of design. Heilmer is referring to the original 1960s brand which under the BMW Group reinvention in 2000 returned to the scene as a capitalized MINI brand. “That first car, when designed by Sir Alec Issigonis, was born into crazy political times - the Suez canal and so on. We’re facing even stranger times now,” he says.</p>

      <p>My parents were both original Mini drivers and, like many Londoners of the 60s, their first car was this undisputed symbol of the Swinging Sixties, of liberation and youth culture. Times have changed - the traditional motor car is seen less as a progressive, youthful product. The Mini and The Italian Job, the movie which at the acting hands of Michael Caine and the musical score of Quincy Jones cemented its cool status, celebrate their joint 50<sup>th</sup> birthday, perhaps it’s time for the modern MINI to define itself as the voice of this new era, I suggest.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Heilmer agrees and feels MINI can do this through sustainable materials. He is excited about the possibilities technologies like advanced 3D printing bring to design. “3D knitting is something we’re looking at as you can create complex shapes using the technology.” He says his team follow closely the innovations in sportswear, looking at ways of exploring these for the more complex automotive environment.</p>

      <p>Recently, the company revealed its first electric car. The MINI Electric is technologically advanced, yet the design does little to convey this. Heilmer has strong views on this. Whereas some brands, he feels, need to shout out about technology, MINI has a different audience. “When I told my wife about the electric car, she asked what color I’ll be bringing home as a test car,” he says half-jokingly. “MINI drivers care about the technology, but this is not why they buy these cars. They want to personalize them,” he says so they are more fashion items.</p>

      <p>Which brings us to my next question. Recent debates inside the auto world have circled around the idea of ownership – the death of car ownership to be more precise with car companies scrabbling over how to fit the zeitgeist while still making business profits. “Did you know the next generation, my kids for instance, are going back to buying physical books and wanting to own things? We got it wrong. We do a lot of research into this and the later generation of drivers may not want to share things.”</p>

      <p>Heilmer is also critical of how we’ve been viewing digital elements for the next generation of digital natives. “We need to make digital more human for them, it is about hiding technology and making sure it is a tactile experience. I don’t think the MIINI customer needs to be showing off and saying they are techie.”</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Looking to the future, Heilmer says, “now I need to keep the sympathetic appearance of a more conventional MINI, try reduce elements of this to what’s really necessary, finding what technology is right for MINI and expanding on individualism. Mainly, I need to see where MINI fits into the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/nargessbanks/2018/09/23/mini-living-urban-cabin-beijing/#6f0b56ce5334">bigger context of urban life</a>.”</p>
      <p>The MINI John Cooper Works GP will be available from March 2020 from around $34,000.</p>
