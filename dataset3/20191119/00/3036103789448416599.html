      <h1>BMW shows off i4 electric car</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/staff-writer" target="_blank">Staff Writer</a></address>
      <p>BMW has revealed photos of its i4 electric vehicle, a new sedan which is set to arrive in 2021.</p>
      <p>The pictures were revealed at the 2019 Los Angeles Auto Show and feature the camouflaged i4 during testing in snowy winter conditions in Sweden, with a design similar to the current BMW 3-series.</p>
      <p>The German automaker claims that the i4 can reach up to 600 kilometres of range from a single charge on its 80kWh battery pack.</p>
      <p>By comparison, Tesla recently managed to reach that mileage on a 100kWh battery.</p>
      <h3>Fifth-generation of eDrive</h3>
      <p>BMW said the i4’s electric powertrain employs the fifth generation of BMW’s eDrive system, which includes a high-voltage battery configuration like Porsche’s Taycan.</p>
      <p>The i4’s 390kW electric motor supposedly puts out 523 brake horsepower, allowing the car to go from 0-100 km/h in four seconds.</p>
      <p>This gives the car a performance output that mirrors BMW’s current V8 engines.</p>
      <h3>More electric BMWs coming</h3>
      <p>The BMW i4 will be the third car in BMW’s electric line-up.</p>
      <p>The i3 hatchback has been the lone electric-only BMW model since 2013, while the electric variant of the X3 SUV is due to launch in 2020.</p>
      <p>BMW plans to expand its electric offering with up to five dedicated i-series vehicles by the end of 2021.</p>
      <p>By 2025, it endeavours to have 12 electric cars across the entire BMW Group, which also includes Mini and Rolls-Royce.</p>
