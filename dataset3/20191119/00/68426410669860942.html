      <h1>David Rosenberg to leave Gluskin Sheff to set up his own consulting firm</h1>

      <p>David Rosenberg is leaving Gluskin Sheff and Associates Inc. after more than 10 years to set up his own financial markets and economics consulting firm, according to a notice on his new company’s website.</p>
      <p>Rosenberg, Gluskin Sheff’s chief economist and strategist, has established an office at Brookfield Place in Toronto’s financial district and will launch publications in the first quarter of next year.</p>
      <p>He will continue to publish his research under the Gluskin Sheff banner until the transition is complete.</p>
      <p>“Having already assembled a team of first-rate analysts, David will now be joined by additional economists, macroeconomic modelers and strategists to provide even more in-depth material," according to the statement. "In addition to his regular menu of Espresso, Breakfast and Buffet with Dave, there will be new publications added, as well as a wider choice of services for retail and institutional investors.”</p>
      <p>Rosenberg is one of North America’s most well-known economists and rose to wealth management fame with his housing market bubble calls in 2005 while working at Merrill Lynch.</p>
      <p>Private-equity firm Onex bought Gluskin Sheff in June for about $445-million.</p>
      <p>Rosenberg and representatives with Gluskin Sheff would not provide immediate comment.</p>
