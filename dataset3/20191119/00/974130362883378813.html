      <h1>Watch: Sensational Ireland U21s Light It Up With 4-1 Victory Over Sweden</h1>

      <p>A night of supreme football unfolded at Tallaght Stadium as the Ireland U21s welcomed Sweden to Dublin for a vital Euro 2021 qualifier tonight. It finished 4-1 to Stephen Kenny's side but this was as much about the performance as it was the result.</p>
      <p>Ireland were without several key players due to injury and by half-time, they lost two more as Jayson Molumby and Conor Masterson were taken off for Liam Scales and Connor Ronan.</p>
      <p>An early Viktor Gyökeres strike had them chasing the game but the second-half saw the tables turn as Ireland blitzed the right-hand side with O'Connor and Zach Elbouzedi excelling.</p>

      <p>It was the right-back who grabbed the equaliser after linking up with the excellent Adam Idah. The Norwich forward lead the line magnificently, linking up play and winning free-kicks throughout.</p>

      <p>He got his just reward as well with a goal just after the hour mark.</p>

      <p>Sweden are the second seeds in the group, behind Italy, but started to panic after going behind and peppered Gavin Bazunu's goal without ever really threatening.</p>
      <p>That resulted in space in behind and when Troy Parrott found himself one on one racing in off the left-wing, the result was inevitable.</p>

      <p>To wrap it up, Elbouzedi and Ronan demonstrate superb pace and expert understanding to allow the Waterford FC winger tap in at the back post.</p>
      <p>This was a remarkable result. A team missing Dara O'Shea, Aaron Connolly, Luca Connell, Jonathan Afolabi, Trevor Clarke, Neil Farrugia and Michael Obafemi played with relentless energy and extraordinary skill. With Sweden still to play Italy home and away, the group is now wide open.</p>
      <p>Next up Ireland play Iceland in March and make no mistake, this group will play.</p>
