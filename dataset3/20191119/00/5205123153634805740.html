      <p>While plenty are to be struggling with her intonations, others appear to be enjoying the fact that they have little to no clue what the former Girls Aloud member is saying.</p>
      <p>"Watching <i>I'm A Celeb</i> and Nadine Coyle's accent is going to be the highlight of this season I already know it," said one Twitter user.</p>
      <p>Another posted: "Honestly girl, no need to change your accent, could listen to your voice for days."</p>

      <p>Prior to entering the jungle, Coyle admitted that she was having apprehension about the competition, but insisted she was determined to overcome her fears.</p>
      <p>"I really want to try something completely new. I am scared of so many things. I used to be brave. In the past, Iâ€™ve opened a restaurant, had a record label, had my daughter and it was go, go, go with all of these," she said.</p>
      <p>"Now I have got so fearful even being in the car, flying or general things. I think it is since I became a parent that I am much more afraid.</p>
      <p>"I really hope that by doing this, it pushes me so far out the comfort zone and that I learn to be comfortable, feel relaxed and do the things that I didnâ€™t used to be afraid of."</p>
