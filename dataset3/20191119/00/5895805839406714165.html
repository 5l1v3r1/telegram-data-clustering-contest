      <p>"Children are a social benefit to everyone, but they are a public good for which <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/singletons/200807/if-dads-helped-more-would-moms-have-more-babies%C2%A0">mothers are paying a disproportionately high price,</a>” observed a researcher at the University of New South Wales' Social Policy Research Centre more than a decade ago.</p>
      <p>With fathers assuming more active roles at home, you have to wonder why in 2019 views remain measurably different about parents' roles, <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/happiness">happiness</a>, and well-being. Clinical psychologist Darcy Lockman, author of <a href="https://amzn.to/2JZEiLd">All the Rage: Mothers, Fathers, and the Myth of Equal Partnership</a>, writes in a <i>New York Times </i>Op-Ed, “What ‘Good’ Dads Get Away With,” that “By passively refusing to take an equal role, men are reinforcing ‘a separation of spheres that underpins masculine ideals and perpetuates a <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/gender">gender</a> order privileging men over women.’”</p>
      <p>To which Ashley McQuire, writing for the Institute of Family Studies, finds that “the liberal feminist obsession with chores to be dated and tired.” She argues, “Those women want to be the primary caregivers for their children and are happy when they can prioritize what they do at home. It’s a cold, hard fact that for some reason, feminists like Lockman just cannot accept.”</p>
      <p>When the Pew Research Center looked at the numbers recently, the split for housework is 18 hours per week for mothers, 10 hours for fathers. Additionally, Pew found that more mothers, 53 percent, feel they spend enough time with their children. Only 36 percent of fathers take that position. In short, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/01/08/most-dads-say-they-spend-too-little-time-with-their-children-about-a-quarter-live-apart-from-them/">most dads would like more time with their children.</a></p>
      <p>On childcare, fathers spend about 8 hours a week (an uptick from men’s 2.5 hours 50 years ago) compared with mothers’ 14 hours, according to the Pew.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Happy Mothers, Happier Dads</b>
      </p>
      <p>How mothers and fathers spend the time they have with their children affects mothers’ and fathers’ well-being. A new study, “Happy Moms, Happier Dads: Gendered <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/caregiving">Caregiving</a> and Parents’ Affect,” underscores <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/singletons/201806/in-the-work-life-struggle-who-is-happier-mom-or-dad">previous research</a> indicating that dads are happier and tells us why. The study’s researchers, Cadhla McDonnell, Nancy Luke, and Susan E. Short, analyzed specific childcare activities to determine where and when the activity took place, which parent was present, how much care was involved and how mothers’ and fathers’ moods were affected.</p>
      <p>Their study, published in <i>Journal of Family Issues</i>, looked at who did what in terms of meeting a child’s basic needs; who was involved with playtime or <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/sport-and-competition">sports</a>; or homework help; and who made children’s arrangements, doctor appointments or did most of the transporting. They focused on the context of care rather than the amount of time spent to determine a parent’s level of stress and happiness. The authors state, “<a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/parenting">Parenting</a> is emotionally demanding and highly gendered. We observe a gender imbalance in the emotional rewards of childcare: Fathers report more happiness, less stress, and less tiredness than mothers.”</p>
      <p>Mothers who work say that “despite these challenges, many working parents – including about 8-in-10 full-time working mothers – their <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/09/12/despite-challenges-at-home-and-work-most-working-moms-and-dads-say-being-employed-is-whats-best-for-them/">current employment situation is what's best for them </a>at this point in their life regardless of the stress and feelings that working “makes it harder for them to be a good parent.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>The Stress Factor</b>
      </p>
      <p>Difficulties aside for both parents, for fathers in the “Happy Moms, Happier Dads” study, the emotional rewards were greater; they were happier and less stressed because they engaged in more recreational activities and fewer of the <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/stress">stressful</a> aspects of parenting.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/nurturing-resilience/201809/fathers-are-doing-more-childcare-ever">Reporting on findings from an Austrian study</a> for <i>Psychology Today</i>, Michael Ungar takes the position that because fathers are doing more childcare, they are becoming more stressed than mothers especially in families with young children.</p>
      <p>Leah Ruppanner, who teaches sociology at the University of Melbourne, found otherwise. She and her colleagues reviewed data collected from about 20,000 Australian families over 16 years. In addition to finding that <a href="https://theconversation.com/having-a-second-child-worsens-parents-mental-health-new-research-107806">having a second child affects the mental health of parents</a>, she concluded that “Prior to childbirth, mothers and fathers report similar levels of time pressure. Once the first child is born, time pressure increases for both parents. Yet this effect is substantially larger for mothers than fathers. Second children double parents’ time pressure, further widening the gap between mothers and fathers.” Time pressures and the stress they create “did not diminish as children aged.” Ruppanner’s findings seem to hold even when children reach <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/adolescence">adolescence</a>.</p>
      <p>
        <b>As Children Age</b>
      </p>
      <p>The study, “Mothers' and Fathers' Well-Being in Parenting Across the Arch of <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/child-development">Child Development</a>: Well-Being in Parenting by Child Age,” assessed how 18,000+ parents felt in different activities with children at different ages using the American Time Use Survey Well‐Being Module. Ann Meier, lead researcher, found that both parents are least happy with teens, but mothers “report more stress and less meaning [than fathers] with adolescents.” The study underscores that the teen years are hard on parents’ happiness and well-being. Nonetheless, the researchers summarized that “mothers shoulder stress that fathers do not, even after accounting for differences in the context of their parenting activities.”</p>
      <p>Among the families you know or in your own, would you agree that the father is happier, less stressed and more content than the mother in relation to raising the children? Or, do you feel, like Ashley McQuire, that “women want to be the primary caregivers for their children and are happy when they can prioritize what they do at home” regardless of how it affects their well-being?</p>

      <p>Feminist research ignores the fact that divorced fathers are all too often denied contact with their children....which is a result of feminist divorce courts that falsely presume that mothers are the better parent.</p>
      <p>Title IV-D of the Social Security Act incentivizes maximum collection of child support, which translates to minimal time that a divorced father is allowed to see his children. Custodial mothers often poison their children against their father - that is called parental alienation.</p>
      <p>Today is International Men's Day. It's unfortunate to see blogs that claim women are victims, and ignore the bad situations that men face.</p>

      <p>For your information, men know that marriage (and children) is a very bad deal, so men are increasingly shunning it.</p>
      <p>And, we men have a message for women that talk about women on International Men's Day: "You're welcome".</p>

      <p>Including my own spouse, who has children. Not one mentioned International Men's Day, and not one has shunned marriage or children.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, it is not only men who are delaying marriage (note the word delay and not shun), it is both men and women age groups 18-34. There are a lot of factors that go into these social dynamics, and one is financial.</p>
      <p>There have always been people shunning marriage and children - the behavior is nothing new. a cursory look at literature and a study of history, to include reproductive patterns in history will bear that out. The difference now is that you get to get on the internet due to technology and literacy and discuss it. Heck, some of the greatest people in the history of the world did not reproduce.</p>
