      <h1>iOS 13.2.3 released with additional bug fixes</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/author.php3?idAuthor=20" target="_blank">Prasad</a></address>
      <p>Apple is now rolling out iOS and iPadOS 13.2.3 for compatible devices. The update is around 90MB in size but actual size will vary with device.</p>
      <p>The list of changes in this update include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fixes an issue where system search and search within Mail, Files, and Notes might not work</li>
        <li>Addresses an issue where photos, links, and other attachments might not display in the Messages details view</li>
        <li>Fixes an issue that could prevent apps from downloading content in the background</li>
        <li>Resolves issues that may prevent Mail from fetching new messages, and fail to include and quote original message content in Exchange accounts</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The latest update is yet another in a string of patches that have come out since Apple released iOS last month. The OS certainly didn't release in a stable state but Apple has been relentlessly updating it ever since and it is definitely in better shape now than since it came out. The latest updates fixed yet more minor bugs that users have noticed in the past few weeks and while there maybe some more left, it's likely Apple is aware of them and already working on a fix.</p>
      <p>We would definitely recommend keeping auto updates enabled and downloading every new patch going forward for the most stable performance.</p>
