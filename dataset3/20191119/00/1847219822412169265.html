        <b>In the first half of the week, the sky will be cloudy in Latvia. Some precipitation zones are possible above certain districts. However, generally no considerable precipitation is expected in the country, as reported by Latvia’s State Environment, Geology and Meteorology Centre.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Wind will draw in from the south-east and east. Fog may form in some areas in morning hours.</p>
      <h3>Air temperature will remain positive in night hours, whereas daytime air temperature may reach +10° C.</h3>
      <p>On Wednesday a wide anticyclone will form above Russia’s western territories, which will also dictate weather in Latvia. Colder masses of air will flow to the country from the south. Clouds will cover most of the country’s territory. Nevertheless, weather will remain dry.</p>
      <p>Anticyclone activity will increase at the end of the week. The sky will clear and air temperature will drop considerably, dropping to -3° C… -5° C in eastern regions at night.</p>
      <p>On weekends the negative air temperature is expected in most of the country’s territory – daytime air temperature will reach a maximum of -3° C, whereas night-time air temperature will drop to -3° C… -6° C. Air temperature will range between 0° C… +1° C along the coast.</p>
      <p>Similar to the beginning of the week, wind will draw in from the south-east and the east. No significant precipitation is expected.</p>
