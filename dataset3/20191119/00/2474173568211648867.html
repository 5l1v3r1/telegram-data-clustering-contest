      <p>Things I’d buy from Marie Kondo: trays, drawer organisers, nesting boxes, sensible cardigans, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling books. Well, good for me, because yesterday, Kondo expanded her lifestyle brand and turned it into a hub for all things Marie Kondo, called The Shop at KonMari. </p>
      <p>The shop launched with six categories: the obvious Tidying &amp; Organising and Decor &amp; Living; as well as the not-so-obvious Tabletop &amp; Entertaining, Aromatherapy, Cooking &amp; Kitchen, and Bath Essentials. You can also expect new products to hit these <a href="https://shop.konmari.com/">virtual shelves</a> every month. It’s a highly curated, uber-stylish collection of lifestyle items and homewares. As of yet, it's only available in the US.</p>
      <p>But it appears that items which truly spark joy come at a price. Some notable inclusions: this <a href="https://shop.konmari.com/collections/decor-living/products/konmari-decor-konmari-tuning-fork">$50 (£39) tuning fork</a> to help you reset and "restore a sense of balance" and help amplify the healing qualities of your crystal collection. This <a href="https://shop.konmari.com/collections/decor-living/products/konmari-decor-bath-s-n-brass-mirror">$150 (£116) brass mirror</a> looks like it will show you your reflection if you were in an entirely different tax bracket. Other items, like this <a href="https://shop.konmari.com/collections/tidying-organization/products/konmari-tidying-hay-computer-brush">computer brush</a> (made with goat hair) or <a href="https://shop.konmari.com/collections/cooking-kitchen/products/konmari-table-kitchen-takada-tawashi-crumb-brush">crumb brush </a>(for when a swipe of the hand isn't enough) hold the promise of turning your daily tasks into exercises in mindfulness. Some items, like this $200 (£155) <a href="https://shop.konmari.com/collections/cooking-kitchen/products/konmari-kitchen-hatashikki-tea-container">tea container</a> or <a href="https://shop.konmari.com/collections/tidying-organization/products/konmari-tidying-building-block-desktop-box-veg-tan">desktop box</a> (a totally normal $75/£58) are a clear attempt to keep that appetite for Kondo-esque organisation going throughout the year. </p>
      <p>Yes, these items are elegant, but the prices are steep – and forking out big sums of money to maintain your commitment to KonMari is a recipe to make you feel like a failure when you inevitably don't manage to keep up with a professional organiser's way of living. Normal life gets in the way, and you don't need a <a href="https://shop.konmari.com/collections/cooking-kitchen/products/konmari-kitchen-alabama-sawyer-countertop-compost-bin">£135 countertop compost bin</a> (even one made from naturally fallen trees from a forest in Alabama) to stare passive-aggressively at you after you accidentally dump a bunch of carrot peel in the normal bin.</p>
      <p>And do you know what? It's okay that every item you own doesn't spark joy. Things like your kitchen utensils. Your soap holders. Your rubbish bin. They serve a purpose and, while it may seem noble to replace them with eco-friendly, naturally sourced materially made items that biodegrade or raise awareness or whatever, the <i>actual</i> most eco-friendly thing you can do is keep the products you already own and make use of them – rather than sending them all off to landfill.</p>
      <p>And that, my friends, should spark the most joy of all.</p>
