      <p>AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) - A panel in Maine has ruled that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/uber/">Uber</a> discriminated against a blind woman when a driver refused to give her a ride because she was traveling with her guide dog.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/portland-press/">Portland Press</a> Herald reports the Maine Human Rights Commission voted Monday that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/uber/">Uber</a> discriminated against <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patricia-sarchi/">Patricia Sarchi</a> because of her visual impairment.</p>
      <p>The report says a manicurist ordered an <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/uber/">Uber</a> for <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patricia-sarchi/">Sarchi</a> after an appointment in January 2017. The driver told <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patricia-sarchi/">Sarchi</a> he could not give her a ride because she had her guide dog.</p>
      <p>The ride-sharing company later charged <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/patricia-sarchi/">Sarchi</a> a $5 ride cancellation fee.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/uber/">Uber</a> argued it could not be held responsible because its drivers are independent contractors.</p>
