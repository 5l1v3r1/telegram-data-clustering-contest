      <h1>DSS Reveals Fresh Facts About Sowore’s Continued Detention</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Enioluwa Adeniyi</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/dss/"><u><b>Department of State Services</b></u></a>, on Tuesday while speaking on its decision to detain the convener of the “RevolutionNow” movement, <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/omoyele-sowore/"><u><b>Omoyele Sowore</b></u></a>, stated that he could be knocked down by a vehicle on his way out if eventually released.</p>
      <p>The development was made known by the spokesperson of DSS, Peter Afunanya while speaking with newsmen in Abuja.</p>
      <p>Afunanya said,<i> “We cannot just release Sowore and ask him to go because he may be knocked down by a vehicle at the gate.”</i></p>
      <p>The DSS spokesperson while speaking on Sowore’s Lawyer, <b>Femi Falana</b>, coming forward for his release said the human rights activist had not been to the headquarters of the service since the Sahara Reporter Publisher was granted bail.</p>
      <p>He further stated that DSS is following administrative procedures by insisting that Sowore’s sureties come forward for proper documentation.</p>
      <p>
        <i>“We respect rules and orders of the court and there was never a time the Director-General said he would not release Sowore”.</i>
      </p>
      <p>Recall that a <a href="http://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/06/breaking-sowore-bakare-have-met-bail-condition-will-be-released-today-falana/"><u><b>Federal High Court in Abuja had recently ordered the release of Sowore</b></u></a> and his co-defendant, Olawale Adebayo.</p>
      <p>The DSS is yet to comply with the order and claimed that no surety had come to take Sowore on bail.</p>
      <p>A group of protesters led by <a href="http://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/12/sowore-we-were-given-n1m-not-to-protest-adeyanju/"><u><b>Deji Adeyanju a few weeks ago alleged that they were given N1m</b></u></a> not to protest against the continued detention of Sowore.</p>
      <p>The DSS, however, said it will release Sowore if his sureties come forward for documentation.</p>
