      <p>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) - Two former Florida city officials are among five people federal authorities say bilked the government out of $5 million in Hurricane Michael cleanup money.</p>
      <p>U.S. Attorney Lawrence Keefe announced the arrests Tuesday of former Lynn Haven City Manager Michael White and former community services director David Horton. Also arrested were two local business owners and an employee at one of the businesses.</p>
      <p>The 35-count indictment includes charges of wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, theft and honest services fraud.</p>
      <p>Keefe says White and Horton approved false invoices and authorized payments to Erosion Control Specialists and Greenleaf Lawn Care and then received reimbursements from the Federal Emergency Management Agency for work that was never done.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>White resigned as city manager in March after facing another unrelated criminal charge.</p>
