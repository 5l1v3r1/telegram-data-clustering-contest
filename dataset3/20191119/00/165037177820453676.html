        <b>Ex Everton director, Steve Walsh, revealed that they were offered several of the best players today, but the club didn't agree with signing them.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Everton's recent history is of a thriving team that haven't managed to situate themselves in the Premier League's elite. The historic team could have changed their luck if they had listened more to <b>Steve Walsh</b>, a former director of the club.</p>
      <p>Walsh spoke with 'The Athletic' about the signings that could have arrived at Goodison Park but that they didn't make. "<b>When I was at Everton, I offered the team Andrew Robertson and Harry Maguire. We would only have had to pay around 25 million euros for them, but Everton didn't want to make these transfers</b>", he started by saying to the aforementioned source.</p>

      <p>Steve Walsh, who was at Leicester when the Foxes won the Premier League, assured that Maguire and Robertson weren't the only ones. <b>Everton didn't want to sign Jonny Evans or Erling Haaland either</b>.</p>
      <p><b>"Erling Haaland, the boy who's doing well for Salzburg. We had an agreement with his father for about five million euros, but Everton did not support me</b>," he said about the Norwegian, before ensuring that the Northern Irish Jonny Evans could have joined Everton before signing for Leicester.</p>
