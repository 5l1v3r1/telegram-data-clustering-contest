      <p>BENGALURU (Reuters) - The top 200 Chinese companies spanning consumer, technology, industrial, property and financial industries reported September quarter earnings well ahead of market expectations, setting them up for a strong showing next year, analysts said.</p>
      <p>These companies mostly beat lowered market expectations as consumer spending remained strong, boosted by Chinese shoppers who opted to buy at home than to travel abroad, as a weaker yuan inflated travel costs.</p>
      <p>Profits at Chinese companies grew 10% in the July-September period, beating the 2% growth rate analysts had predicted, and ahead of China's slowing economic growth rate. Only companies with a market capitalization of over $1 billion and tracked by at least three analysts are covered in this analysis.</p>

      <p>"The sectors that were expected to suffer from the U.S.-China trade conflict — the tech hardware exporters, textiles and sports goods exporters — have largely outperformed consensus expectations," said Manishi Raychaudhuri, head of equity research at BNP Paribas (PA:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/bnp-paribas">BNPP</a>) Asia Pacific.</p>

      <p>Raychaudhuri added that earnings growth at Asian companies, excluding Japan, is likely to bounce back in 2020, partly as trade concerns recede.</p>

      <p>Below is a report card of the third quarter for Asian companies and expectations for next year.</p>
      <p>** Online retail giants Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (N:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/alibaba">BABA</a>) and JD.com Inc (O:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/jd.com-inc-adr">JD</a>) posted strong sales as people bought baby products and sports gear. Western luxury and mass-market consumer companies had a good quarter as well.</p>
      <p>** Overall, profitability at 1,625 Asian firms fell 5%, versus an expected 6% decline, according to a Reuters analysis of Refinitiv data. Results outperformed estimates for the first time in five quarters.</p>
      <p>** Hong Kong-listed firms are not included in this analysis, as most of them announce earnings results on a semi-annual basis.</p>
      <p>** Profits at 346 South Korean firms nearly halved, dragged down by lower chip prices and a fluctuation in commodity prices.</p>
      <p>** Profit at Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/samsung-electronics-co-ltd">005930</a>) fell 56%. Smaller rival SK Hynix Inc (KS:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/sk-hynix-inc">000660</a>) posted its lowest profit in three years. Steelmaker Posco's (KS:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/posco-inc">005490</a>) earnings plunged by a third as iron ore prices rose.</p>
      <p>** Profits at 201 Indian firms rose 29.5%, led by consumer staples, financial and healthcare firms and helped by a corporate tax cut.</p>
      <p>** Profits at 673 Japanese firms which exclude SoftBank Group Corp (T:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/softbank-corp.">9984</a>), fell 1%, in line with estimates, as the yen firmed and demand fell for export items such as cars and machinery.</p>
      <p>** The top three Japanese steelmakers and carmakers Suzuki Motor Corp (T:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/suzuki-motor-corp.">7269</a>) and Mitsubishi Motors Corp (T:<a href="https://www.investing.com/equities/mitsubishi-motors-corp.">7211</a>) have reduced their annual profit forecasts.</p>
      <p>** Analysts expect profits at Asian firms to jump 13% in 2020, versus a 5% estimated increase this year, helped partly by recovering global demand as trade worries ease further.</p>
