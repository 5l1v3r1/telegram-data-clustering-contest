        <b>European Council’s outgoing chairman Donald Tusk has in a speech devoted to his five years in office revealed that he had to remind member states that Russia was Europe’s «strategic problem», instead of being its strategic partner.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In a speech delivered last week in Bruges, Belgium, the former Polish Prime Minister, Tusk explained that he had firstly focused on maintaining the unity of EU against the Kremlin’s aggressive foreign policy in Europe.</p>
      <h3>«I was (and still am) convinced that, in this game, what is at stake, is not only the future of independent Ukraine and the security of Central Europe, including that of my country, but the sovereignty of Europe as a political entity.</h3>
      <p>And I had no doubt that Putin’s strategic goal was not only to regain control of the former Soviet Union territories, but also to systematically weaken the EU by provoking internal divisions. I had to publicly remind others, almost every week, that Russia is not our «strategic partner», but our «strategic problem». I was even labelled a «monomaniac», for being so focused on this subject. But eventually it paid off. We maintained our unity, also in terms of sanctions, throughout my entire term,» the outgoing President of the European Council stated.</p>
      <p>His full speech in Bruges, November 13, is available <a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2019/11/13/keynote-speech-by-president-donal-tusk-at-the-opening-ceremony-of-the-2019-2020-academic-year-at-the-college-of-europe/">here</a>.</p>
