      <p>NEW YORK (AP) - A Brooklyn man who spent more than 23 years in prison has been freed on bail after a judge threw out his murder conviction, pointing partly to the role of a detective whose tactics have come under scrutiny.</p>
      <p>Eliseo DeLeon walked out of court Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Brooklyn prosecutors say they don’t believe DeLeon established his innocence. But they haven’t said yet whether they plan to retry him, appeal or drop the case.</p>
      <p>Now 42, DeLeon was convicted in the June 1995 shooting of Fausto Cordero.</p>
      <p>DeLeon said his confession was fabricated by police, including now-retired Detective Louis Scarcella.</p>

      <p>Scarcella has faced allegations of misconduct from numerous people he helped convict. He has denied wrongdoing.</p>

        <p>Brooklyn state Supreme Court Justice Dena Douglas said Scarcella “demonstrated a disregard for the law.”</p>
