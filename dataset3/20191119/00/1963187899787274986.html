      <p>Egypt coach Hossam Al Badry said he would not be silent again against those who criticize the team without "rationality". <br/><br/>"I will respond to those who do not speak rationally because they do not know the technical issues in the team and I will reveal their mistakes," Al Badry told On Sport on Monday after a 0-0 draw with Comoros in the second round of the 2021 AFCON qualifiers. <br/><br/>"We faced difficult circumstances, represented by the delay in the appointment of the coaching staff, postponing the league for a long time and not going to many friendly matches." <br/><br/>"This is in addition to the injuries that hit some players, and not calling some players who have faced problems with their clubs," Al Badry added. <br/><br/>"I salute all the players and thank them today," he said. <br/><br/>"We have four games ahead and we will qualify for the African Nations," he stressed.</p>
