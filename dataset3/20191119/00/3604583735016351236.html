      <p>THOUGH they were removed four months ago, the fierce debate surrounding Daylesford's geese continues.</p>
      <p>Hepburn Shire Council removed more than 30 geese from the iconic tourist hot spot in late July, citing environmental, social and economic reasons.</p>
      <p>The council's reasoning for removing the geese was that the animals were impacting the environment at the lake by driving away native birds, having received a number of complaints about their aggressive behaviour as well as the cost of cleaning up after them.</p>
      <p>A petition of approximately 370 signatures, gathered by Gina Lyons, will be handed to council at its meeting this evening, urging councillors to allow a small community flock of about 10 geese to return to the lake.</p>

      <p>Ms Lyons said more than 200 of the signatures were of locals, while the remainder were of visitors to the lake.</p>
      <p>"It has been going on for four months and people are still sending petitions and letters to the editor," Ms Lyons said. "This indicates how strongly people feel about the issue. It would be the biggest petition the council has received in a year."</p>

      <p>She said the lake had been "lifeless and soulless" since the geese were removed and that locals had noticed a decline in other waterbirds at the lake since the geese's removal, given that they protected other birds from foxes.</p>
      <p>"We have a community garden, a community cinema - why not a community flock," the petition reads.</p>
      <p>A group of 12 residents have campaigned for a flock of geese to be returned to the lake since it was removed. This is the third petition to be handed to the council.</p>
      <p>Hepburn Shire Council were contacted for comment.</p>
      <p>The petition will be tabled at tonight's meeting. A report will go the December 18 council meeting.</p>
