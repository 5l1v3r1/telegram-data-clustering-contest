      <p>A 25-year-old PhD student of the Gandhi Krishi Vignan Kendra (GKVK) committed suicide by hanging on Sunday night. The victim, a native of Uttar Pradesh, left behind a suicide note stating that nobody is responsible for her death. The student Prema Tripathi is said to have been staying with a male PhD student, who is from Tamil Nadu. The latter had gone to his hometown three days ago. Police are in the process of questioning him to know his relationship with the victim. <br/><br/>The Kodigehalli police, who have registered the case identified the victim as Prema Tripathi, who stays at a rented accommodation in Canara Bank Layout in Kodigehalli. <br/><br/>The incident came to light on Sunday around 10 pm. As it was holiday for the college on Sunday, she was at home. In her suicide note, she takes full responsibility of her act. Police said they are probing the exact reason behind the suicide.</p>

      <p>–A police officer<br/><br/>“The exact reason for the suicide is being probed. She was staying with another male student in the room. This student is a native of Tamil Nadu and was not at home at the time of the incident. The body has been handed over to her parents after the post-mortem,” said an officer. <br/><br/><b>Double murder during drunken brawl<br/></b><br/>Two men were murdered after a party between four friends in the city’s South division police limits turned into a brawl. <br/><br/>All the accused are daily wage labourers. Two suspects have been taken into custody. The Thalagattapura police has registered a case. <br/><br/>The deceased are identified as Subramani, 35, a construction labourer and Santosh Pillai, 33, a painter by profession. <br/><br/>The incident has happened at a slum area in Vinayaka Nagar in Thalagattapura on Sunday night. The police have taken the custody of Ravi and Mahaveer, suspecting them of being behind the murder. Both the victims are from Tamil Nadu. <br/><br/><br/>The two along with the accused two did not have any specific place to stay. They would stay at the place where they used to work. They reportedly had no contacts with their family members. If they did not have any work, they would come to the Vinayaka Nagar slum area to drink. Mahaveer was also a construction labourer and Ravi was a painter by profession. <br/><br/>“None of the four had money to party on Sunday night. Of the four, Subramani had managed to get some money on loan from a friend identified as Palani. With the money, all of them consumed alcohol and were sitting under a tree in the slum area. During the party, all of them started fighting over trivial issues and Subramani started beating Pillai for fighting with him even though he had managed to pool money for the party,” said an officer on part of investigations. <br/><br/><br/>During the heated argument, Pillai is alleged to have put a cement block on Subramani’s head, killing him on the spot. Frustrated over this, the other two have also put cement block on Pillai’s head and he was shifted to a hospital where he succumbed to injuries. Further investigations are on.</p>
