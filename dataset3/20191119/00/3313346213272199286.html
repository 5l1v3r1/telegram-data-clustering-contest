      <p>This summer <i>League of Legends </i>maker Riot Games added a mega-popular auto-battler mode to the game called <i>Teamfight Tactics</i>, and at the <a href="http://www.gdconf.com/?_mc=blog_x_gama_le_x_gdcsf_x_x-18-gdc20">Game Developers Conference</a> in March you'll have a chance to see how it was made!</p>
      <p>This is a big deal because a team within Riot designed <i>Teamfight Tactics </i>in less than six months, honing in on what makes a great auto-battler game and finding a way to realize it within <i>League of Legends</i>, and you'll hear all about it in a GDC 2020 Design Track talk on <a href="https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/teamfight-tactics-design-lessons/869423?_mc=blog_x_gama_le_x_gdcsf_x_x-18-gdc20">'<i>Teamfight Tactics</i>' Design Lessons</a>.</p>
