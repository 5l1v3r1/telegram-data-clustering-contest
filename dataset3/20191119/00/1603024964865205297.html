      <p>The Indian rupee opened lower by 7 paise at 71.91 per dollar on Tuesday versus Monday's close 71.84.</p>
      <p>On November 18, the rupee erased early morning gains to settle 6 paise lower at 71.84 against the dollar on the back of continued forex outflows and gains in the dollar in global markets.</p>
      <p>US oil prices fell for the second straight day on Tuesday amid market jitters over limited progress between China and the United States on rolling back trade tariffs, exacerbated by a rise in US inventories.</p>
