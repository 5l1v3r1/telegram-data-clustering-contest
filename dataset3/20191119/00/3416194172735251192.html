      <p>The drama is reportedly squashed between <a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/selena-gomez/"><b>Selena Gomez</b></a> and <a href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/tags/bella-hadid/"><b>Bella Hadid</b></a>.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/18/bella-hadid-selena-gomez-instagram-deletion-no-feud/?adid=justjaredsocialexchange">TMZ</a>, <b>Bella</b> “went out of her way to reach out to <b>Selena</b> this weekend to squash any potential beef.”</p>
      <p>The site added, “<b>Bella</b> told <b>Selena</b> it was never about taking a shot, the model simply deleted because she didn’t like the pic.”</p>
      <p>Everyone thought <b>Bella</b> might be shading <b>Selena</b> when she deleted an Instagram post that <b>Selena</b> had commented on.</p>
      <p>When <b>Selena</b> saw that <b>Bella</b> had deleted the post, she wrote <a href="http://www.justjared.com/2019/11/18/selena-gomez-reacts-to-bella-hadid-deleting-that-instagram-photo-she-left-a-comment-on/">“that sucks” on another post</a>. Later, <b>Selena </b>tried to explain that she <a href="http://www.justjared.com/2019/11/18/selena-gomez-clarifies-bella-hadid-instagram-controversy-once-for-all/">shouldn’t have written that without knowing the full situation</a>.</p>
