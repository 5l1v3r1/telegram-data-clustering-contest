      <h1>Drinking Water in Colorado Exposes Thousands to Arsenic</h1>
      <h2>A new study by the Delta County Health Department (DCHD) and University of Colorado discovered thousands of Colorado residents are drinking water contaminated with arsenic.</h2>

      <p>The Delta County Health Department (DCHD) partnered with the University of Colorado to study water quality in private wells.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.colorado.edu/engineering/2019/10/30/partnership-puts-valuable-water-quality-information-western-slope-online">The study analyzed 457 wells</a>, 11% of which had <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/biomonitoring/Arsenic_FactSheet.html">arsenic</a> concentrations above the water standard maximum contaminant level. 15% of the well water tested exceeded at least one primary drinking water contaminant state standard, <a href="https://www.9news.com/article/news/local/next/study-some-well-water-in-colorado-has-high-levels-of-arsenic/73-134d9f38-750d-4d91-a5f8-4c2e503ddbce">according to the findings</a>.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.sos.state.co.us/CCR/GenerateRulePdf.do?ruleVersionId=7862&amp;fileName=5%20CCR%201002-11">state and EPA standard for arsenic</a> are the same, according to the Rocky Mountain Poison Center.</p>
      <p>There was a significant lack of information readily available to the public about the quality of water in around 10,000 private drinking water wells, <a href="https://www.9news.com/article/news/local/next/study-some-well-water-in-colorado-has-high-levels-of-arsenic/73-134d9f38-750d-4d91-a5f8-4c2e503ddbce">according to 9 News</a>. 60% of the population in this area drink water from private wells that aren't regulated because they're privately owned.</p>
      <p>"We were concerned," <a href="https://www.9news.com/article/news/local/next/study-some-well-water-in-colorado-has-high-levels-of-arsenic/73-134d9f38-750d-4d91-a5f8-4c2e503ddbce">said Ken Nordstrom</a>, department director of DCHD, "We had no knowledge on the western slope of private drinking water quality."</p>
      <p>Not all owners are routinely testing their wells for a number of reasons, particularly because testing costs around $250 a well. Filtration and contaminant removal can cost about $1,000.</p>
      <p>Considering the wells are privately owned, the county can only tell the owners there is an issue with the water, but can't force them to actually fix it.</p>
      <p>Holly Miller, who recently completed a master’s degree in the Environmental Engineering Program at CU Boulder, <a href="https://deltacolorado.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapSeries/index.html?appid=391e306dbe144ca49fdbdd667d52e429">created an interactive map</a> so people can see which wells test higher for contamination. The site shows locations for all the tested wells and provides resources to request free testing kits.</p>
