      <p>When it came out in 2017, the original got almost universally bad reviews.</p>
      <p>Now three of its biggest stars have joined calls for director Zack Snyder's edit to be shown the light of day.</p>

      <p>Justice League was supposed to be DC Comics' answer to Marvel's The Avengers - a way to bring the franchise's biggest names together in one movie.</p>
      <p>But it was hit by big problems.</p>
      <p>Its original director, Zack Snyder, had a family tragedy and had to drop out in post-production.</p>
      <p>The film was then taken on by Joss Whedon.</p>
      <p>When it was released it was hardly a critical success - ending up with a woeful 40% on the website which pulls together critical reviews,Â Rotten Tomatoes.</p>
