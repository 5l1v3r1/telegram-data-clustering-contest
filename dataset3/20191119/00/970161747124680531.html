        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/caitlyn-jenner/">Caitlyn Jenner</a> confessed the Kardashians and Jenners ‘know’ about her stint on I’m A Celeb but aren’t showing their support on social media.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Olympian and the I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here! contestants chatted about her famous family, and she revealed they were told about her appearance on the show.</p>
      <p>Asked if her kids knew if she was doing I’m A Celeb, the 70-year-old said: ‘Yeah, they all know.’</p>
      <p>So far, Kylie and Kendall Jenner and the rest of the Kardashian clan have been extremely silent on Caitlyn’s appearance, considering the family usually promote themselves on Instagram.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, James Haskell admitted he ‘used to’ fancy Kendall saying: ‘I used to have a massive crush on Kendall.’</p>
      <p>‘I think most men on the planet have fancied one of your daughters at some point,’ comedian Andrew Maxwell replied.</p>

      <p>The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star then switched the topic to her transition.</p>
      <p>She opened up: ‘I thought I was gonna transition before I was 40, I didn’t want to be an old chick but this is the latter 80’s and I never felt like I fitted in anywhere, I was trying to figure myself out, running around town. Cross-dressing running around.’</p>

      <p>‘So you’d crossdress in your car and drive around town?’ asked Andrew.</p>
      <p>Caitlyn answered: ‘Yeah, at the time, I had a turbo Porsche and it was like the day before Halloween and this car pulled up beside me and it’s my next door neighbour, I said I was going to a Halloween party.’</p>
      <p>The star came out as a trans woman in a 20/20 interview with Diane Sawyer in April 2015 and had her sex reassignment surgery in January 2017.</p>
      <p>James continued: ‘It’s interesting about wanting to express yourself and how hard it is in life wanting to express yourself but having a thing where you can’t let it and that you have to drive around town.</p>
      <p>‘I think the biggest thing about your thing is all those people thinking about not being able to do it is the fact they should feel comfortable to do it however hard it is because 99% of the time it’ll work out alright.’</p>
