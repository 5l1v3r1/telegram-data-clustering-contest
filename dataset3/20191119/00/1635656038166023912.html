      <h4>Nike Joyride Run Flyknit (£160)</h4>
      <figure>

      <p>Running on beads might sound like something out of <i>Home Alone</i>, but Nike’s answer to impact reduction is actually quite the opposite: the soles of these Joyride kicks contain more than 10,000 tiny beads, all for the cause of cushioning your feet as you pound the frozen pavement.</p>
      <p>What’s the logic? Unlike the Wet Bandits walking on broken baubles, the bouncy beads adjust to your foot with every stride, adding spongey comfort and speedy kickback to slash your run splits and recovery times alike.</p>

      <h4>Urbanista Athens (£129)</h4>

      </figure>
      <p>Whether it’s Eminem or Enya, the right playlist could shave seconds off your PB – but dangling cables can distract even the most committed sprinters. For motivation without frustration, go wireless with these dinky Bluetooth ‘phones from Urbanista.</p>
      <p>Punchy bass will spur you on as you feel the burn, while IP67 waterproofing means even the wettest winter shower won’t slow you down. There’s voice control, too, while a trio of silicone wings guarantees a good fit. Going long-distance? The ’buds are good for eight hours on one charge – or 32 if you bring the charging case along for your ultramarathon.</p>

      <h4>Fossil Sport (£219)</h4>

      </figure>
      <p>Christmas Day parkrun? Complete. Sense of satisfaction? Acquired. Cash for a recovery smoothie? Forgotten. No sweat: Fossil’s Sport smartwatch is compatible with Google Pay. Simply tap your ticker like a contactless card and you’ve paid for the protein.</p>
      <p>When you’re not shopping, the WearOS watch is an ideal fitness companion, complete with full-round touchscreen, offline music storage, heart-rate tracking and in-built GPS. Google Fit will keep track of your activity and coach you to your goals, too – and with a battery that can stretch past two days in low-power mode, you’ll have plenty of training time.</p>

      <h4>Under Armour Rush ColdGear Mock (£60)</h4>

      </figure>
      <p>Sweating while shivering is one of the strange realities of winter running. Don this baselayer to control your core temperature without trapping moisture.</p>
      <p>Infused with unidentified minerals and cut to stay close to your skin without hugging it, the stretchy fabric is at once both breathable and absorbent. Sweat is let out, while bodily warmth is reflected back at your muscles to enhance performance and improve recovery. Like a heat-sensitive sieve, only much smarter.</p>

      <h4>Lumos Matrix (£200)</h4>

      </figure>
      <p>Whether you’re riding before dawn or commuting in the saddle, visibility is a battle when it’s dark by 16.30. For protection that’ll get you noticed, stick this smart shiner on your noggin. Fronted by a bar of bright white light, things get even better at the back, where an RGB dot matrix display makes your head unmissable.</p>
      <p>Customisable designs are cute, but cooler is the automatic brake signal and the option to trigger turning arrows with the remote or partner app. And with a battery good for up to 10 hours, this is truly a can you can rely on.</p>

      <h4>Haglöfs Teide 60 (£65)</h4>

      </figure>
      <p>After an intense upper body kettlebell session, it’s hard enough lifting your smartphone to share a #gains selfie, let a lone hauling a hefty holdall all the way home. Avoid extra baggage with this featherweight duffel from Haglöfs.</p>
      <p>Lightweight yet large enough at 60 litres to haul all of your stinky gym gear, its party trick is packing down into a tiny pocket – so the only thing taking up space will be your swole ego.</p>

      <h4>Garmin Swim 2 (£220)</h4>

      </figure>
      <p>Count yourself among the number of nutty souls who like to fling themselves into freezing seas every New Year’s Day? You might as well get credit for your natural ice bath. Strap this dedicated swimming ticker on your wrist, select the open-water mode and dive on in.</p>
      <p>While you’re shivering in the shallows, it’ll count your strokes, track your swim distance via GPS and even read your heart rate underwater. Not keen on a nippy dip? There’s a pool mode, too, for those who prefer to keep the feeling in their fingers and toes.</p>

      <p>Creating your own assault course out of hedges and sledges was never a good idea. Not only are your earphones somewhere in the undergrowth, but your toboggan is a goner after that conifer collision.</p>
      <p>Still, at least the prize for completion can be these Jabra ‘phones: waterproof, open to outside sounds and good for nine hours of sound, they also feature ear hooks for added comfort and security. Whether you feel like testing them in the brambles on a surrogate sled is up to you.</p>
