      <p>All-rounder Sam Curran is eager to cement his spot in England's Test side by contributing with both bat and ball, and wants to "stop being the one that is vulnerable".</p>
      <p>Curran, 21, has so far featured in 11 Tests, scoring 541 runs to go with his 21 wickets. He was picked in this year's Ashes squad but the experienced Chris Woakes was preferred on all four occasions.</p>
      <p>"There was [frustration]," Curran admitted, "but the team was in a good place going into the Ashes. I was in all the squads, so that was a confidence booster. At the same time you'd love to be playing, and as the series went on you're itching to get out on the field."</p>

      <p>England's latest Test assignment is a two-match affair against New Zealand which starts on Thursday, 21 November, at the Bay Oval in Mount Maunganui. Curran featured in the second warm-up game against a New Zealand A side, in which he scored a run-a-ball 13 and picked up three wickets in the second innings. </p>
      <p>Curran's hoping if he gets a nod ahead of his competitor Woakes, he'd try to make the most of the opportunity.</p>

      <p>"I think if I do get the chance it is about nailing down my spot in the side and stop being the one that is vulnerable," he said. "That is my responsibility and whoever gets the spot, if it is me, has to take the opportunity by getting runs and taking wickets and contributing to the team. If I do get the nod, hopefully, I can go well and contribute with both bat and ball.</p>
      <p>"As an all-rounder, I look up to someone like Stokesy [Ben Stokes] and the way he contributes with the bat up the order and he takes wickets when he bowls and that is what I aspire to do. As long as I'm helping to win games for the team then I'm happy."</p>

      <p>Curran also took inspiration from England's current pace sensation Jofra Archer, and said that bowling alongside him in the same team would be "exciting". </p>
      <p>"He’s an amazing bowler and one you want on your side. I’m sure he’s going to be raring to go and it will be exciting to be playing on the same team as him. I don’t think our batters would want to be facing him. Hopefully, he can ruffle a few feathers."</p>
