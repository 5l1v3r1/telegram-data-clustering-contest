      <p>We're firmly of the opinion that <b><a href="http://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_sword_and_shield">Pokémon Sword And Shield</a></b> – while not perfect – is a fine video game that has clearly had a lot of blood, sweat and tears invested in it. However, it would seem that in the effort to get the title to market, developer Game Freak slipped up a little when it came to creating the ending.</p>
      <p>During the end credits for the game, a mouse cursor is clearly seen floating around the screen. The video is shown below, and it goes without saying, if you'd rather not have a portion of the ending ruined for you before you see it yourself, then navigate away from this page as quick as you can – this is spoiler territory.</p>
      <p>Still here? Good, then watch the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWAVpjPPC4w">here</a> to see what we mean.</p>
      <p>Now, on first inspection, you may be tempted to assume this is some kind of elaborate joke, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGhFmCSsOqA">other</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0aiGUvsPjs">videos</a> have cropped up online which show the same mistake.</p>
      <p>We'd imagine this problem will be patched out of the game pretty quickly, but it made us chuckle, at least.</p>
