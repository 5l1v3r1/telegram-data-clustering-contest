      <p> </p>
      <p>Wheat importation by Nigeria is defying the President Muhammadu Buhari regime’s trend of cutting down on import of food crops. </p>
      <p>Data released by the United States Department for Agriculture shows a 367,000 metric tonne increase in purchase of various wheat brands from the US. </p>
      <p>The country purchased 936,000mt of wheat as at October 2019, as against 569,000 bought at the same time last year.</p>
      <p>Inversely, America’s economic rival China, has drastically reduced its import of wheat which is a strategic commodity for the US economy. </p>
      <p>The USDA figures, which are current as at mid-October 2019, shows a 14 per cent surge in exports. </p>
      <p>On all brands of wheat exported by the US highlighted by Thefencepost, imports from Nigeria dropped on only a grade called durum. </p>
      <p>The variant favoured by Nigerian importers is known as Hard Red Winter.</p>
      <p>The country more than doubled its importation of the brand to 567,000 as at October 10, 2019. </p>
      <p>It was second in the purchase of HRW to US’s neighbour – Mexico. </p>
      <p>The next brand Nigerian importers preferred is Soft Red winter.</p>
      <p>Again, its volume of import rose by 50 per cent to 142,000mt. </p>
      <p>Nigeria was once again second to Mexico. </p>
      <p>The other product favoured by Nigeria was Hard White wheat.</p>
      <p>Nigeria’s interest in Hard White grew by nine per cent to 123,000mt. </p>
      <p>Its purchase of Durum however, decreased by 58 per cent to 28,000 as at Oct 11, 2019.</p>
      <p>Besides the US, Nigeria also imports as much wheat as it exports its citizens to Canada. </p>
      <p>The country has since 2007 tried unsuccessfully to diversify away from the use of wheat in flour making to cassava where it has competitive advantage. </p>
      <p>The Buhari administration has been silent on the implementation of the High Quality Cassava Flour. </p>
