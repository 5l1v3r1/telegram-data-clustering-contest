      <p>The state government of Louisiana was hit by a ransomware attack today that impacted numerous state services including the Office of Motor Vehicles, the Department of Health, and the Department of Transportion and Development.</p>
      <p>The attack was first reported at 11am, after there was a forced shutdown of numerous web sites operated by the state as well as email and Internet services.</p>
      <p>Local media <a href="https://www.fox8live.com/2019/11/18/multiple-la-state-websites-email-systems-down/">reports</a> that this attack caused disruptions at numerous state services, including all of the 79 Office of Motor Vehicle locations.</p>
      <p>"The issue also prevented business from being done at any of the state’s 79 OMV locations. A worker at The Louisiana Department of Health (LDH) said employees there were instructed to disconnect their computers from the network. Some trucking companies in the state are having to keep trucks off the road as they are unable to go onto the DOTD website to apply for and print out things like “overweight” permits."</p>
      <p>In a series of tweets, Governorr John Bel Edwards stated that he has activated the Louisiana's cybersecurity team to coordinate the disruption of this attack.</p>

      <p>This "cybersecurity team" is part of the Louisiana <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ransomware-attacks-prompt-louisiana-to-declare-state-of-emergency/">Cybersecurity Commission</a> established by Gov. Edwards in 2017, which includes law enforcement, cybersecurity professionals from the public and private sector, and academia, to provide a coordinated response to cybersecurity attacks.</p>
      <p>"The Louisiana Cybersecurity Commission is hereby established. The Commission shall coordinate cybersecurity efforts among state governmental agencies, local governments, tribal governments, private companies, academic institutions, and other entities in both the public and private sectors. Active participation by federal agencies is encouraged and would further enhance the objectives of the Commission."</p>
      <p>Louisiana's Office of Technology Services stated that this attack is similar to the attack on Louisiana schools in July that led Governor Edwards to declare a state of emergency.</p>
      <p>“No one is immune to these attempted cyber attacks, which is why Governor Edwards’ has focused on building Louisiana’s cybersecurity capabilities," the governor’s commissioner of administration, Jay Dardenne, said in a statement. "Our experts train and prepare for these types of incidents and have been successful in mitigating similar issues in the past, including this summer when our teams successfully brought services back online following the cyber attack on local schools. We have confidence in our cyber safeguards, capabilities and personnel and we are working to bring as many online services back online as quickly as we can.”</p>
      <p>At this time it not known what type of ransomware was distributed in this attack.</p>
