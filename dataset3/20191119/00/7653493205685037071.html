      <h1>Logitech Launch Gaming Kit For Disabled Gamers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.channelnews.com.au/author/jan-arreza/" target="_blank">Jan Arreza</a></address>
      <p>Logitech has introduced its Logitech G Adaptive Gaming Kit, which are a collection of buttons and triggers designed for gamers with accessibility issues.</p>
      <p>Compatible with the Xbox Adaptive Controller (XAC), the Adaptive Gaming Kit lets gamers play the way that’s most suitable for them by providing a set of controls that are easily configured to a wide variety of use cases.</p>
      <p>The Adaptive Gaming Kit is expected to be available on the <a href="https://www.logitechg.com/en-au"><u>Logitech G website</u></a> and through select Microsoft retail stores by the end of this month for $99.99.</p>
      <p>It features a large assortment of buttons and triggers with gaming-grade components for performance and durability, manufactured to the highest standard, at a price point that is far more accessible than what is on the market today.</p>
      <p>“The Logitech G Adaptive Gaming Kit is designed to be the perfect companion to the Xbox Adaptive Controller, giving gamers the necessary tools they need at a more affordable price point,” said Ujesh Desai, vice-president and general manager of Logitech Gaming.</p>
      <p>“It also supports our commitment to inclusivity and diversity in gaming, because fundamentally we believe that life is more fun when you play, and everyone should be able to experience the joys of play.”</p>

      <p>Logitech G worked the Microsoft Inclusive Tech Lab and leading accessibility groups including, The AbleGamers Charity, Abilities Research Centre at Mount Sinai, and SpecialEffect, to develop the Adaptive Gaming Kit to ensure it met the needs of the community.</p>
      <p>“The goal of AbleGamers is to find a way for people with varying abilities to play video games,” said Steve Spohn, AbleGamers CEO.</p>
      <p>“Everyone’s needs are different, and the Logitech G Adaptive Gaming Kit delivers a wide range of configuration options to make gaming a possibility for all.”</p>
      <p>“We appreciated the opportunity to work closely with Logitech G on the design of this kit and look forward to continuing our partnership in the future.”</p>
      <p>The Adaptive Gaming Kit includes three small buttons and three large buttons that feature gaming-grade mechanical switches. It also includes four light touch buttons, two variable trigger controls, configurable game mats with a hook and loop system, and custom labels and Velcro ties.</p>
      <p>“The Xbox Adaptive Controller opened up gaming to people with disabilities all around the world,” said Jenny Lay-Flurrie, chief accessibility officer at Microsoft.</p>
      <p>“With the addition of Logitech G’s Adaptive Gamin Kit, we’re excited to see that impact continue to grow.”</p>
      <p>”It’s never been more important to design through the lens of disability and push the boundaries of what technology can do to be inclusive of everyone around the world.”</p>
