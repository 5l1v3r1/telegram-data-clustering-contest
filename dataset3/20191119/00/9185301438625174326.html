      <h1>Blake Alexander to drive Jim Head Funny Car in 2020</h1>
      <h2>Blake Alexander will move to the Pronto Auto Service Centers / Head Contractors Funny Car in 2020</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Jacob Sundstrom, NHRA National Dragster Associate Editor</a></address>
      <p>Blake Alexander and Jim Head are teaming up in 2020 to run 20 events. Alexander will drive a Ford Mustang Funny Car tuned by Head with Pronto Auto Parts and Head Contactors bannered on the side as the duo join forces in the 2020 Mello Yello NHRA Drag Racing Series season.</p>
      <p>Alexander drove his Ford Mustang Funny Car he owned and operated during the 2019 season and reached the semifinals at the Auto Club NHRA Finals. He accumulated a round win-loss record of 4-12 in his first season back in a Funny Car after driving Top Fuel for back-to-back seasons.</p>
      <p>“I enjoyed working with Jim when I drove his car in Bristol and I’m happy to say that we will be merging and beginning a business partnership,” Alexander said. “I am looking forward to a successful relationship with Jim and his group for many years to come. I really appreciate the Wilkerson’s kindness and dedication in helping a young race team flourish in 2019. Tim is someone that I look up to. Krista and him together are no doubt role models, and people that I greatly respect. I look forward to seeing them, Daniel Wilkerson and my crew at the race track next season.”</p>
      <p>Head and Alexander worked together once before in 2019 when the racer drove the Head Contractors Funny Car at the NHRA Thunder Valley Nationals. He will replace former Top Alcohol Funny Car world champion Jonnie Lindberg in the seat. Lindberg drove for Head since early in the 2017 season; the Swedish driver reached four final rounds with Head.</p>
      <p>“Firstly, I want to thank Jonnie Lindberg for his services since 2017. 10 years ago, Blake and his wife Leah came into my lounge at Pomona and asked me about driving my car,” said Head. “I told them I wasn’t looking for a driver — I was looking for a business partner. Blake has, no doubt, worked hard to get where he is now, and we are excited that our partnership will begin in 2020. Having an asset like Blake will help us succeed on and off the racetrack.”</p>
      <p>The team will share liveries of Pronto Auto Service Centers and Head Contractors and Engineers at events held across the nation.</p>
      <p>“We are excited to continue The Pronto Nitro Club promotion and hospitality area available for National Pronto Association membership and their customers in 2020,” said Robert Roos, President, National Pronto Association. “Many of our members take advantage of the NHRA experience, and we see great value in the promotion with their respective customer bases. We started doing one NHRA event with Blake five years ago. The program and the support from all involved parties has grown and been phenomenal.”</p>
      <p>The 2020 Mello Yello NHRA Drag Racing Series begins with the Lucas Oil NHRA Winternationals in Pomona. [<a href="https://ev3.evenue.net/cgi-bin/ncommerce3/SEGetGroupList?groupCode=PC1&amp;linkID=nhra&amp;shopperContext=&amp;caller=&amp;appCode=">Tickets</a>]</p>
