      </p>
      <p>When I said goodbye to Dylan on November 21st, 2013, I did not think it would be the last time I would see him. He left me smiling, on his way to visit a friend in Long Beach for the night. That evening, at the young age of 26, Dylan was found deceased. His cause of death was an accidental overdose on <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/conditions/opioids">Oxycodone</a>.</p>
      <p>Dylan was one of over 16,000 Americans who died in prescription painkiller related deaths in 2013 (in 2017 it was 47,600). The current opioid epidemic is unprecedented. Reports state that more than 130 people die from opioid-related drug overdoses each day, with the economic cost of the opioid crisis estimated to be $504 billion.</p>
      <p>While effective analgesics, opioids are highly addictive, and adult patients undergoing surgery who receive an opioid prescription are at an increased risk of misusing and persistently using opioids. Time and time again, America witnesses the same story: a patient visits a doctor complaining about a sudden moderate pain or perhaps a chronic issue; the doctor provides the quickest solution on the market, prescription narcotic painkillers; the patient leaves satisfied and often on their way to a nasty <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/addiction">addiction</a>.</p>
      <p>But why is this story becoming more common rather than less, despite increasing awareness of the prevalence of addiction in mainstream American culture? Why have physicians dished out more of these medications in recent years, rather than refusing to provide them to patients? How and why did opioids transition from being a treatment for end of life illness and postoperative pain relief to a commonly doled out solution to headaches and back pains? Theory suggests, and research confirms, that doctors were influenced by pressure from two angles: that of the manufacturers and of the patients.</p>
      <p>The irony is that prescription narcotics do not fit their new purpose. According to Dr. Andrew Kolodny, president of the Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing, controlled narcotics such as Hydrocodone and Oxycodone are “actually ineffective in treating long-term pain.” However, in a culture of fast food, instant messaging, and quick results, Americans seeking pain relief are not as concerned with the long-term solution.</p>
      <p>A lot of society’s trust goes into the capabilities of modern medicine, and while the rise of prescription opioids was strongly driven by manufacturers and pharmaceutical companies, patients welcomed it. And when the patients have a demand, the pressure to fulfill these needs falls on the doctors. As Celine Gounder, physician, public-health specialist, and medical journalist wrote in the New Yorker, “The promise of a set of medicines that could cure pain was appealing to many patients—and, with a customer-is-always-right mentality having pervaded the doctor’s office, patients were able to pressure physicians to satisfy their requests for the pain pills they’d begun hearing about.” Gounder explains the difficulties for a doctor to deny the requests of their patients and send them out of their visit dissatisfied. “Doctors have a hard time saying no, whether a patient is asking for a narcotic to relieve pain or an antibiotic for the common cold. We are predisposed to say yes, even if we know it isn’t right.”</p>
      <p>What’s worse is the consistent consumption of drugs like Hydrocodone and Oxycodone leads to increased tolerance and a condition called hyperalgesia, which is the increased sensitivity to pain after long term intake of pain <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/psychopharmacology">medication</a>. These consequences, in turn, require more pain medication for the patient and dependency develops before the drugs were ever technically abused.</p>
      <p>With such a gradual progression to reliance on drugs labeled as legal and supplied in unnecessarily high quantities by an authority figure in a lab coat, patients and drug seekers do not <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/fear">fear</a> the consequences of addiction or overdose. It is difficult to believe that the doctors we trust and depend on would put us at risk with the frequency and justification of prescription, the amount of opioids per prescription, and the number of refills on each prescription. The reality is that pain medication is not meant for long term use and the amount of pain after an operation should only last up to one week However, “there’s not enough awareness about how serious this crisis is,” Kolodny said. “I don’t think enough doctors know that these painkiller medicines don’t work for <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/chronic-pain">chronic pain</a>.”</p>
      <p>The pharmaceutical companies, from the start of this painkiller epidemic, capitalized on their ability to keep doctors misinformed. Big drug manufacturers recruited attractive marketers to convince physicians that their drug was the best painkiller on the market. We had cheerleaders from Big Ten schools, with no medical background or knowledge, put into a boot camp to learn the workings of the pharmaceutical industry, the doctor they will be selling to, and the benefits of their drug. It is these businessmen and women that are going into our doctors’ offices and selling our health care providers on what will be best for us, our family, our friends, and our loved ones. And doctors have been temporarily pleased when their patients report less pain, considering their job well done.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, once a doctor has begun prescribing these medications to the patients, it is difficult for them and their successors to cease providing these drugs. Taking that stand would lead to unhappy and dissatisfied patients, and the potential accusations against the doctors of malpractice. There are also the doctors who “just don’t want to take the extra time during a busy day to explain why that prescription for a narcotic isn’t a good idea” and those who “use the promise of prescription narcotics to persuade patients to keep their medical appointments, or to take their other medications,” writes Gounder. Dr. Sanjay Gupta expressed similar concerns in his CNN article: “It is easier for a doctor to write a prescription than to explore other effective options to combat pain, and it is easier for patients to take those prescription pills than to search for alternatives themselves. Both those things must absolutely change."</p>
      <p>So how can the methodology of doctors treating pain be improved? Just as important, how can the patients’ understanding of a doctor’s decision to deny narcotics in certain circumstances be improved? The work must be done on multiple levels. Primarily, between the physicians and the FDA, there needs to be a relabeling of painkillers. Currently, the labeling on narcotics has no suggested maximum dose or duration of use by the FDA. Kolodny describes this as being “very broad.” He insists that “the way to turn this epidemic around is for doctors to prescribe painkillers more cautiously." And according to Kolodny, the FDA must change the labeling requirements on prescription painkillers so that it is “easier for medical schools and the larger medical community to prescribe these meds more cautiously."</p>
      <p>The next step would be providing <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/education">education</a> to healthcare providers from sources other than the pharmaceutical companies. While doctors, for the most part, have good intentions when prescribing medication, they receive no more than a week's worth of education on pain and pain <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/leadership">management</a>. Education on addiction, predispositions to addiction, and abuse of medication could help doctors better identify at-risk patients and take preventative measures or connect those suffering to treatment.</p>
      <p>As patients of our doctors and consumers of the pharmaceutical industry’s products, we must also take some action. With the knowledge that these medications could lead to negative consequences, we have the choice to seek other forms of pain management. Further, there are <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/genetics">DNA</a> tests available to see if you are predisposed to addiction. As a society, it is important that we know our own bodies and take steps to put an end to this pill epidemic.</p>
      <p>Dylan’s death is just one of the countless lives lost. When we receive a prescription, we never think it could change our lives or the lives of others. Dylan did not get his first pain killer prescription with the intention to abuse the medication. However, as the refills were readily available, so was the opportunity to develop what turned out to be a deadly dependency. In a society where we are addicted to relief, a small prescription needs a big warning.</p>

      <p>Dr Thomas Klein, Pain Medicine and Addiction Specialist, has written that a person must have a genetic predisposition to addiction to become addicted. Less than 1% of chronic pain patients become addicted. Additionally, my son,<br/>who struggled with addiction as a teen, is now able to use his prescribed pain medication properly and with great benefit. The young man in this story chose not to follow the directions from his physician and it led to his untimely death. Personal responsibility is being lost in this conversation. Pain medication isn’t being doled out like candy. The pill mills have been closed for years! And each news story citing the number of pills dispensed by a certain physician is not looked at closely. Some people require 6-8 tablets a day to reign in their pain. So the number of pills need to be looked at accordingly.</p>

      <p>Data published by the CDC itself disprove your premise. America's public health crisis wasn't created by doctors over-prescribing to their patients, and isn't being sustained from that source now. Opioids are prescribed for pain six times more often in seniors over age 62 compared to youth under age 19. But youth have opioid overdose related mortality six times higher than seniors. Moreover, overdose mortality in seniors has been relatively stable for 20 years, while rising precipitously in youth. There is simply no rational way to explain this demographic inversion as a consequence of prescribing. You can't get there from here. Period.</p>

      <p>This is absolute propaganda. You do realize the FDA called PROP the lunatic fringe, right? Opioids are very effective for long-term, chronic pain when used correctly. You do realize, there are many pain conditions without a cure, of which are now going without treatment because of this insanity? Yeah, yeah, there are treatments, but most are totally ineffective, costly, and sometimes require multiple visits. You have someone in chronic pain, it's doubtful they have enough money for any of that. There is going to come a time in the near future, to where we will have justice and turn this into a civil rights movement. You mark my words, many doctors are going to get a wake-up call when that happens. Continue the abuse of patients, diminish their quality of life, and something is coming.</p>

      <p>Submitted by Buffi on November 21, 2019 - 3:14am</p>
      <p>Your article says that prescription opioids are becoming more common rather than less. Did you do ANY research for this article or did Kolodny just whisper propaganda in your ear in hopes of boosting sales of suboxone?</p>
      <p>You are spewing blatant lies or you are just misinformed and shouldn’t be writing a blog post about this issue.</p>
      <p>10s of thousands if not more of chronic pain patients have had their quality of life diminished because they no longer have access to opioids. I’m one of those patients. Many have chosen the path of suicide because life in pain is unbearable.</p>
      <p>I recommend you do more research. You obviously have personal experience with a loved one who died of addiction and for that I sympathize with you. But don’t let that experience blind you to the facts. A good journalist looks at the facts, the statistics, and tries to see both sides of a story. Don’t look for what you want to see or just listen to people who tell you what you want to hear, look at the actual INFORMATION. Please, for my sake and the sake of so many more.</p>
