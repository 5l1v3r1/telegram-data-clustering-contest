      <p>The National Executive Committee (NEC) of the <a href="http://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/18/just-in-buhari-in-closed-door-meeting-with-oshiomhole-apc-govs-others/"><u><b>All Progressive Congress</b></u></a> is expected to meet on Friday to deliberate on the internal crisis in the party.</p>
      <p>Naija News recalls that internal crises in the party got to an extreme stage last week that led to the suspension of some top officials.</p>
      <p>The Director-General of Progressives Governors Forum (PGF), <a href="http://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/13/just-in-apc-governors-give-adams-oshiomhole-ultimatum-to-resign-as-national-chairman/"><u><b>Dr. Salihu Lukman</b></u></a> also requested for the resignation of the National Chairman, <b>Mr. Adams Oshiomhole</b> or convene the statutory NEC meeting to resolve some of the lingering crises in the party or resign from office.</p>
      <p>Though, there was no official statement from the party at the end of the meeting, it was gathered that the party would hold its caucus meeting at the Presidential Villa on Thursday ahead of the NEC meeting on Friday.</p>
      <p>According to a source privy to the meeting, the issues that would be discussed on Friday would be how to fill the vacant positions like National Auditor, a position held by <a href="http://www.naijanews.com/2019/10/02/next-level-president-buhari-approves-appointment-of-moghalu/"><u><b>Mr. George Moghalu</b></u></a>, who was recently appointed as the Managing Director, National Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA); Deputy Vice Chairman, South, a position held by <b>Chief Niyi Adebayo</b>, who was also appointed as the Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment; and the position of National Secretary, which was previously held by <a href="http://www.naijanews.com/2019/03/11/inec-declares-apcs-buni-winner-of-yobe-guber-poll/"><u><b>Mr. Mai Mala Buni</b></u></a>, the Yobe State governor.</p>
      <p>Another issue to be discussed is the suspension of the Deputy National Chairman, North, <b>Senator Lawal Shuaibu</b>, who was suspended by NWC for alleged anti-party activities, as well as the suspension of National Vice Chairman, North-west, <b>Alhaji Inuwa Abdulkadir</b>, for the same offence.</p>
      <p>Also, the suspension of former governors<a href="http://www.naijanews.com/2019/06/26/ogun-why-fg-must-probe-senator-amosun-apc/"><u><b>, Senator Ibikunle Amosun (Ogun)</b> </u></a>and<a href="http://www.naijanews.com/2018/05/15/apc-prevents-rochas-okorocha-from-stopping-congress-in-imo-state/"><u><b> Senator Rochas Okorocha (Imo)</b></u></a>, for alleged anti-party activities is also expected to be discussed.</p>
      <p>The ongoing crisis in Edo State chapter of the party, between Oshiomhole and the governor, <a href="http://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/13/embattled-oshiomhole-face-tougher-threats-as-edo-gov-obaseki-endorses-suspension/"><u><b>Mr. Godwin Obaseki</b></u></a>, would equally be discussed.</p>
