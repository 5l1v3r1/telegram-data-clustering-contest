      <p>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) - Authorities say a small plane that crashed on a Utah highway made an emergency landing on the same highway last year.</p>
      <p>Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Allen Kenitzer says the single-engine plane hit a billboard Sunday and crashed near Ogden-Hinckley Airport on Interstate 15.</p>
      <p>The pilot instructor, his student and a bystander were injured but officials did not disclose more details.</p>
      <p>April Wilcock told the Standard-Examiner newspaper that her 32-year-old brother Bryce Ransom suffered heart and lung bruises but is expected to survive.</p>
      <p>Authorities say the same plane clipped a car when the plane landed on Interstate 15 in May 2018. No one was hurt.</p>
