      <p>Suspected herdsmen in Kaduna have hacked an 87-year-old man to death.</p>
      <p>The Hoodlums also shot and killed another person.</p>
      <p>According to Morning Star News, a Christain newspaper, a group of herdsmen attacked Agom Village in Southern Kaduna at 4:30am.</p>
      <p>The area resident of Evangelical Reformed Church of Christ, Gabriel Yakubu, added that Monday Kura, 87, and Emmanuel Agom, 48, were killed as they slept in their rooms.</p>
      <p>He said, "The Fulani herdsmen cut Monday Kura, 87, with a machete until he died, while Emmanuel, 48, was shot dead with a gun.</p>
      <p>"We need prayers as my village is on fire and we are not getting any protection from the government."</p>
      <p>It was the first herdsmen attack on the village, which is four kilometres from the town of Gwantu.</p>
      <p>The assault followed other attacks in Southern Kaduna that took the lives of 130 Christians in recent past.</p>
