      <p><a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/lac/la-clippers">LA Clippers</a> forward <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/6450/kawhi-leonard">Kawhi Leonard</a> will miss Monday's game against the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/okc/oklahoma-city-thunder">Oklahoma City Thunder</a>, sources told ESPN's Ramona Shelburne.</p>
      <p>Leonard suffered a left knee contusion in the second half of the Clippers loss to the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/_/name/hou/houston-rockets">Houston Rockets</a> on Wednesday and did not play against New Orleans on Thursday and Atlanta on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Leonard has now missed five of the Clippers' 14 games this season, and has yet to play alongside star teammate <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/player/_/id/4251/paul-george">Paul George</a> -- who made his Clippers debut on Thursday.</p>
      <p>George has helped mitigate Leonard's absence, having scored 70 points in just 44 minutes over the last two games.</p>
      <p>Leonard's been effective as well when he's been on the court this season, averaging 26.8 points per game to go along with a career-high 6 assists.</p>
