      <h1>PlayStation 5 controller – A first look</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/author/bradley-prior" target="_blank">Bradley Prior</a></address>
      <p>Images filed with the <a href="https://www.j-platpat.inpit.go.jp/d0200"><b>Japanese Patent Office</b></a> have provided the first look at what the upcoming PlayStation 5 controller may look like.</p>
      <p>According to these sketches, there doesn’t appear to be much that is significantly different when compared with the current DualShock 4 controller, but there are some <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/18/sony-patent-may-show-playstation-5-controller/"><b>minor changes</b></a>.</p>
      <p>The PlayStation 5 controller doesn’t appear to have a light bar, which could result in superior battery life – especially when combined with the improved battery Sony is planning on using in the controller.</p>
      <p>The controller in the images also appears to sport slightly larger triggers, and it looks to have dropped the two-tone design.</p>
      <p>The thumbsticks will remain symmetrical, continuing the trend that Microsoft bucked with the Xbox.</p>
      <p>Sony previously <a href="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/gaming/322560-official-playstation-5-launch-date-revealed.html"><b>announced</b></a> that it will adopt haptic feedback to replace the traditional “rumble” technology in its controllers – offering a better range of vibrations and improved immersion.</p>
      <p>The company will also change the way its controllers’ triggers work, with the new triggers allowing developers to manipulate resistance depending on in-game events.</p>
      <p>Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Jim Ryan announced in October that the PlayStation 5 will launch in “holiday 2020.”</p>
      <p>Images of the PlayStation 5 controller patent filing can be viewed below.</p>
