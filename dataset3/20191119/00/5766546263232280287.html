      <p><b>Monrovia – </b>The Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection says it is strengthening coordination and collaboration with partners to ensure that children participate in advocacy and play leadership role in engaging decision-makers for their rights and wellbeing.</p>
      <p>Liberia joins the rest of the world on November 20, 2019 to observe Universal Children’s Day. The day established in 1954 is to promote, advocate and celebrate the rights and welfare of children globally.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, it coincides with the day marking the anniversary of the Declaration of the Rights of the Child and the signing of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. The day was first proclaimed International Children Day on June 1st in 1925 in Geneva with the sole aim of protecting children’s rights and abolishing child labor as a whole.</p>
      <p>Speaking at a news conference recently, the Deputy Minister of Gender, Alice Johnson-Howard said: “We have implemented several programs aimed at ensuring children’s rights are protected and they live in an environment free from neglect, exploitation, and abuses especially abuses associated with sexual gender-based violence(SGBV).”</p>
      <p>This, she says young people will engage decision-makers and relevant state and non-state institutions to promote and to advocate for the implementation of policies, strategies, and programs on ending violence against children.</p>
