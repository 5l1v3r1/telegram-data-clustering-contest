      <p>- While <b>Mandzukic</b> is wanted by <b>United</b>, <b>Borussia Dortmund</b> are ready to compete for the striker, according to Kicker. Mandzukic starred during two seasons with Bayern Munich before leaving the Bundesliga in 2014.</p>
      <p>- <b>Spain</b> have offered <b>Luis Enrique</b> a chance to lead the nation at Euro 2020, according to AS. The Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) have called a news conference for Tuesday, with Luis Enrique reportedly set to replace Robert Moreno at the helm.</p>

      <p>- <b>Manchester United</b> are preparing to try to sign both Borussia Dortmund's <b>Jadon Sancho</b> and RB Salzburg's <b>Erling Haaland</b> in January, according to Goal. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is set to try and strengthen his squad with United nine points adrift of the top four in the Premier League.</p>
      <p>- Chelsea attacker <b>Willian</b> and Napoli midfielder <b>Fabian Ruiz</b> have slowed contract talks with their respective clubs amid interest from <b>Barcelona</b>, according to Mundo Deportivo. Willian is out of contract at season's end, while Fabian's deal runs until 2023.</p>
      <p>- <b>Manchester City </b>are considering making a move for RB Leipzig defender <b>Dayot Upamecano</b>, according to the Mirror. The Premier League champions lost Aymeric Laporte to a knee injury in September and may look to strengthen, although the Frenchman is expected to be back in early 2020.</p>
