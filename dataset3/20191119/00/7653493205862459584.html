      <h1>Dutton To Raise Alarm On Internet Of Things</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.channelnews.com.au/author/elliott-nash/" target="_blank">Elliot Nash</a></address>
      <p>Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton wants to crack down on IoT security, proposing a voluntary code that will require companies to develop a ‘vulnerability disclosure policy’ in a bid to encourage businesses to build devices with safety in mind.</p>
      <p>The proposal laid out by Peter Dutton at the 2019 Home Affairs Industry Summit in Melbourne is a draft code of practice, developed with input from the Australian Cyber Security Centre, which will be released for public consultation until March of next year.</p>
      <p>Dutton hopes the code will require companies to develop a ‘vulnerability disclosure policy’ with the goal of making their systems are secure and resilient to outages.</p>
      <p>It follows the successful push of the ‘Five Eyes’ intelligence alliance with signing countries required to address security shortfalls in internet-connected devices.</p>
      <p>‘The safety of Australians and the security of our economy is paramount,’ said Mr Dutton, clearly linking his concern for the safety of these devices to the health of the Australian economy, rather than the safety and security of users.</p>
      <p>‘Along with our Five Eyes partners, we share the expectation that manufacturers should develop connected devices with security built-in by design.’</p>
      <p>The current proposal will be adjusted in collaboration with states and territories to develop a final version of the industry code.</p>
      <p>According to a report released by research firm <a href="https://securityindepth.com.au/stateofcyber">Security in Depth</a> identified a 700% increase in cyberattacks against Australian businesses since February last year, resulting in a national cost of $7.8 billion.</p>
