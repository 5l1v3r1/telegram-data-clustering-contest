      <p>Nagpur: RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat on Tuesday asked educationists to create excellence among students rather than having a classroom system geared towards<br/>scoring marks in exams.</p>
      <p>He was addressing the ‘International Principals’ Education Conference 2019′ here.</p>
      <p>“Classroom education is not everything, though it has its importance. But the classroom is for real-time experience and how it can be taken forward to a conclusion,” Bhagwat said.</p>
      <p>“Nowadays, marksheets and marks have become more important due to competition. Doing this (giving predominance to marks) is not education. We need to create people through excellence,” he said.</p>
