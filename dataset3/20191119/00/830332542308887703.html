      <h2>Phrase has taken on a life of its own</h2>

      <p>(CNN) - OK, boomer. Ready for a trademark application war?</p>
      <p>The popular phrase, which has mostly been used by teens and millennials to make fun of older people for being out of touch, has taken on a life of its own.</p>
      <p>Most notably, 25-year-old New Zealand lawmaker<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2019/11/06/asia/new-zealand-ok-boomer-trnd/index.html"> Chl√∂e Swarbrick used the phrase</a> to dismiss an older member of parliament for heckling her while she spoke about the country's Zero Carbon Bill.</p>
      <p>Its growing popularity has led to a number of trademark applications that have been filed for its use -- two of which are for TV shows.</p>
      <p>The most <a href="http://tsdr.uspto.gov/documentviewer?caseId=sn88687936&amp;docId=RFA20191114082601#docIndex=0&amp;page=1">notable application comes from Fox</a>, which was discovered by trademark attorney Joshua Gerben. Fox filed the application on November 11.</p>
      <p>The attorney for Fox has signed a sworn intent that the company has a "bona fide intent" to launch a TV series called "OK BOOMER," and Gerben says that it could be "a reality, comedy and/or game show."</p>
      <p>"It would seem unlikely that a company of this size would file such an application unless a show was being considered," Gerben tells CNN.</p>
      <p>However, Fox is not the only one to file a trademark for the phrase.</p>
      <p>On October 31, a man named Kevin Yen based out of New York <a href="http://tsdr.uspto.gov/documentviewer?caseId=sn88675174&amp;docId=RFA20191104080125#docIndex=0&amp;page=1">filed an application for a brand of clothing</a>.</p>
      <p>The day after Fox filed its application, a Pittsburgh-based company <a href="http://tsdr.uspto.gov/documentviewer?caseId=sn88689866&amp;docId=RFA20191115084143#docIndex=0&amp;page=1">filed for a brand of stickers and decals</a>.</p>
      <p>The day after that, producer <a href="http://tsdr.uspto.gov/documentviewer?caseId=sn88691647&amp;docId=FTK20191116082738#docIndex=0&amp;page=1">William Grundfest filed a trademark</a> in his name personally for a TV show. Grundfest's trademark was for a series of live stage performances about "generational differences."</p>
      <p>"In all likelihood, the USPTO will deny all of these applications because OK BOOMER has become a 'widely used message,'" Gerben said. "A trademark registration will not issue in a phrase that is commonly used to convey a social or political message. This is because such a 'viral' phrase is incapable of identifying the source of a product or service -- which is what trademarks must do to be capable of registration."</p>
      <p>Fox did not immediately respond to a request from CNN.</p>
