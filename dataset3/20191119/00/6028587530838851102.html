      <p>Some New York hotels feel overrun with kitschy holiday cheer come Christmas, as though their over-the-top windows exist solely for groups of selfie-snapping travelers whose sole purpose is stop New Yorkers in their tracks. <a href="https://www.arlohotels.com/">The Arlo Soho</a>, situated on the western fringe of the Soho neighborhood, is offering a cooler take on holiday that feels decidedly local.</p>

      <p>Kicking off on December 3, the boutique hotel brand is introducing Après Arlo, the Arlo’s interpretation of “après ski,” even though there’s isn't a mountain in sight. It’s offering classic post-ski indulgences like a rich menu of hearty gut-warmers and hot beverages, best enjoyed in its cozy winter cabins. As guests walk through the hotel's outdoor courtyard, they’ll be transported to the Swiss Alps without ever having to leave Hudson Street. There’s heated cedar cabins decked out in winter finery set against a backdrop of white birch trees, while twinkling lights glisten through faux snow. It all makes for quite an enchanted evening. A full hot toddy menu is also available, including the "Top of the Mountain Toddy" with whiskey, caramel, apple and English Breakfast tea, or the “Chai Chalet Toddy” with cognac, cranberry, vanilla and chai tea.</p>

      <p>Après Arlo will play host to a “Hygge Holiday Fair” on December 7 from 12:00pm to 3:00pm, complete with Fraser Fir-scented candle making, holiday manicures and glammed out wellness treatments, wreath-making bars and guided meditation. Kids can write a letter to Santa Claus or, better yet, meet the big man himself for the perfect holiday card photo moment. Other guests can shop local artisans, sip on warm drinks and delight in complimentary holiday bites from Harold’s, the hotel restaurant.</p>

If you missed the merriment, you can always pop in for a New Year's Eve dinner, or festive day-after brunch on New Year’s Day. And for those seeking to avoid post-holiday gluttony, Après Arlo will also host SleepWell by Vie Wellness, a mindful-focused ritual series centered around sleep. Get your Zzz’s on Wednesdays and Sundays, book yourself some slow flow Pure Yoga, and get into the New Year’s resolutions spirit.</p>
