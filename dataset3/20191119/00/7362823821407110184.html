      <p>The families had already paid upwards of $50,000 to smuggle the victims into the United Kingdom, according to BBC.</p>
      <p>"We already had to borrow so much money, we had to mortgage what we had. I don't even know if we can borrow anymore," said Pham Ngoc Tuan, brother of one of the victims.</p>
      <p>Messages to the Vietnamese consulate in London from Fox News were not immediately returned.</p>

      <p>The bodies -- 31 men and eight women --  were discovered inside a truck in Essex, about 25 miles east of London, on Oct. 23. Two drivers have been <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/crime">charged</a> with manslaughter and suspects in Vietnam's Ha Tinh province have also been taken into custody.</p>
      <p>The truck's container was registered in Bulgaria and entered Britain via ferry after leaving the Belgian port of Zeebrugge.</p>
