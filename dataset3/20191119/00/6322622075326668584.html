      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 19): Hong Leong IB Research has maintained its “Buy” rating on Hock Seng Lee Bhd (HSL) at RM1.31 with a higher target price (TP) of RM1.64 (from RM1.58) and said HSL’s 9MFY19 earnings of RM45 million (+7% y-o-y) were below house and consensus expectations due to slower than expected construction progress billings.</p>
      <p>In a note today, the research house said HSL’s year-to-date (YTD) core PATAMI (+7% y-o-y) increased due to stronger contribution from both construction and property segments.</p>
      <p>“Outstanding order book of RM2.5 billion translates into 4.8x cover ratio with YTD job wins amounting to RM605 million (FY18: RM142m).</p>
      <p>“Cut FY19-21 earnings forecast by 7-10%. Maintain Buy with higher TP of RM1.64 (from RM1.58) despite the earnings cut as we rollover our valuation base to FY20, pegged to an unchanged 13x PE multiple,” it said.</p>
