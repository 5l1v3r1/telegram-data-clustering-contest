      <p>Luis Enrique is back at the helm of the Spain national team, RFEF President Luis Rubiales confirmed in a press conference on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The former Barcelona boss had left the role in June after 11 months in charge due to personal reasons. His replacement and former assistant, Roberto Moreno, duly took his place and guided Spain to UEFA EURO 2020, topping their group on the way to qualification for next year's continental tournament.</p>
      <p>"I was committed to keeping <i>La Roja's</i> doors open for Luis Enrique in case he felt strong enough to return," explained the RFEF president.</p>
      <p>"We thank Robert for his work, but the leader of this project is Luis Enrique and we had the ethical obligation and the commitment to let him return. If he had not felt like coming back, we were fully confident in Robert," Rubiales continued.</p>
      <p>"Luis Enrique told me that he would like to take charge until Qatar and I think he deserves that. He has received better offers, for sure. We are very thankful for his behaviour. We have not negotiated or signed anything yet, but I trust his word."</p>
      <p>Enrique's first games at the helm will come in March 2020, as part of the team's warm-up for the EURO.</p>
