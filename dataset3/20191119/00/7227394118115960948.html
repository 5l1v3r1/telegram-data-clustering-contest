      <h1>New vivo S1 Pro unveiled with 48MP quad cam on the back, sAMOLED display on the front</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/author.php3?idAuthor=12" target="_blank">Peter</a></address>
      <p>A bit ahead of schedule, vivo unveiled the <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/vivo_s1_pro-9972.php">S1 Pro</a> in the Philippines and in a move that is sure to cause much confusion, the phone has little in common with the first <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/vivo_s1_pro-9696.php">vivo S1 Pro</a>. So, forget pop-up selfie cam, instead we’re looking at something closer (but not identical) to the <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/vivo_s5-9948.php">vivo S5</a>, at least on the outside.</p>

      <p>This new vivo S1 Pro will have a 6.38” Super AMOLED display with 1080p+ resolution and a teardrop notch. It houses a 32MP selfie camera, there’s also an in-display fingerprint reader on the front.</p>
      <p>Around the back, the 48MP main camera (1/2” <a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/samsung_announces_two_new_isocell_sensors-news-33970.php">GM1 sensor</a>, f/1.8 aperture) is joined by an 8MP ultrawide angle shooter (108°). A dedicated 2MP macro camera (4cm focus distance) and a 2MP depth sensor bring the total camera count to four. The quartet will be placed on a diamond-shaped camera island, just like on the S5.</p>

      <p>This model will be powered by a Snapdragon 665 chipset, weaker than both the original S1 Pro (Snapdragon 675) and the S5 (Snapdragon 712). The phone will be configured with 8GB of RAM and 128GB storage and will run Funtouch OS 9.2 out of the box (based on Android 9 Pie).</p>
      <p>On the plus side, it will have a larger battery than both – 4,500mAh capacity. The USB-C port supports fast charging at 18W (9V and 2A). There’s also a 3.5mm headphone jack on top.</p>

      <p>The vivo S1 Pro should be available for pre-order in the Philippines soon, it costs PHP 16,000 (that’s around $315). It comes in Fancy Sky (a mostly-white phone with a rainbow effect) and Knight Black (more subtle, but still has a slight gradient to it).</p>
      <p>We don't know what other markets will receive the new S1 Pro, but chances are that they won't overlap with the other S1 Pro.</p>
