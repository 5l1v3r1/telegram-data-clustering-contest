      <p>GREAT FALLS, Mont. (AP) - Jurors are deliberating the case of a man charged with killing a disabled veteran, burying his body in a barn near Great Falls and stealing his disability benefits for several months.</p>
      <p>The prosecution and the defense made their closing arguments Tuesday afternoon.</p>
      <p>Brandon Lee Craft is charged with deliberate homicide, tampering with evidence and exploiting a vulnerable person in the February 2016 death of 28-year-old Adam Petzack.</p>
      <p>Craft initially confessed to killing Petzack, saying he shot him in the back of the head. He wrote letters to his grandmother and his father-in-law saying the same thing.</p>
      <p>However on Tuesday, Craft testified his now ex-wife Katelyn Zdeb was the one who killed Petzack.</p>
