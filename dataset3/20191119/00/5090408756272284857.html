          <b>The good news: Valve has confirmed that a new “Half-Life” game is in the works, with a formal debut to come Thursday morning.</b>

          <b>The weird part: Valve says it’s a “flagship VR game,” a strong indication that it’ll be available only for SteamVR, its PC virtual-reality platform.</b>

          <b>Regardless, the confirmation of a new “Half-Life” game ends a 12-year drought for the many fans of the series.</b>

      <p>In 2007, the mega-hit first-person shooter “Half-Life 2: Episode 2” ended on a massive cliffhanger, with the evil alien Combine having achieved a massive victory that left the heroic Gordon Freeman and his sidekick Alyx in an impossibly sticky situation.</p>
      <p>Fans <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/half-life-3-rumors-history-2018-5">have since been waiting 12 long years and multiple console and PC hardware generations since</a> for any update on the “Half-Life” franchise.</p>
      <p>The good news, then, is that the wait is finally coming to an end: The developer Valve Software has <a href="https://twitter.com/valvesoftware/status/1196566870360387584">confirmed on Twitter that a new game called “Half-Life: Alyx”</a> will be formally announced on a livestream Thursday morning.</p>
      <p>The catch is that Valve also says it will be a “flagship VR game.” While we’ll have to wait for more details, this is a strong indication that “Half-Life: Alyx” will be available only for SteamVR, Valve’s PC virtual-reality platform.</p>

      <p>While Valve first came to prominence as the developer of the first “Half-Life,” way back in 1998, the company’s focus has since largely shifted to Steam, its wildly popular (and profitable) digital PC games storefront and social-networking service.</p>
      <p>As Steam has grown, Valve’s video game releases have grown less frequent. While it still operates hit titles like “Team Fortress 2” and the massive “Dota2” esports phenomenon, it’s largely stopped developing new titles. Its most recent effort, <a href="https://variety.com/2019/gaming/news/valve-pauses-artifact-updates-to-focus-on-games-deep-rooted-issues-1203176371/">“Artifact,” was a critical and commercial flop that was put on hold earlier this year</a>.</p>
      <p>At the same time, “Half-Life” fans never stopped hoping for a new game – though hopes were very much dashed when the lead writer Marc Laidlaw left Valve in 2016. Before Monday’s announcement, the closest we ever got to a conclusion for “Half-Life” was in 2017, when <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/half-life-2-episode-3-story-marc-laidlaw-valve-2017-8">Laidlaw leaked the plot twists that were intended for “Half-Life 2: Episode 3.”</a></p>
      <p>The long drought is now set to end with “Half-Life: Alyx,” with the title seemingly confirming that it will have at least some of the characters from “Half-Life 2.” A virtual-reality title may not be exactly what fans had in mind, though, given that the original game was one of the most influential first-person shooters ever made.</p>
