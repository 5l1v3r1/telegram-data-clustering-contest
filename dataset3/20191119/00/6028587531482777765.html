      <h1>Transforming Your Company Values Into A Powerful Motivating Force</h1>

      <p>Companies have values listed on a poster or in the employee handbook, but nobody remembers them and they have no effect. When the values are noticed, they read like corporate drivel or marketing rubbish. Worst of all, staff do not incorporate them in their own behavior, but only refer to them when a senior manager appears to violate them. Rote and lifeless, the values don’t help recruit and retain best talent. What’s the point?When companies realize they have ineffective values, they often re-write them, adjusting them slightly and perhaps hosting an offsite session to discuss and gain buy-in. Typically, they will make them more thorough, perhaps in response to a specific crisis or problem that has arisen. It may all be very well-intended. But still, the refreshed values don’t resonate or grab the attention of employees. And even if plastered around on new placards, after a month or two, they are once again forgotten. How to bring corporate values to life?</p>
      <p>
        <b>Make It Simple, and Mean It.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The solution is straightforward but requires commitment: express your values in an interesting, unique way; create a process where you keep them clear, practical and top of mind; and then actively refer to and truly live by them.</p>
      <p>“It is crazy the impact our corporate values, <i>Show up, Smile, Support</i>, have had,” says Kevin Schnieders of Educational Data Systems, Inc. (EDSI), the workforce development company based in Dearborn, Michigan. “We have a culture across 45 offices and more than 700 staff that is more consistent than just about any other company I've seen. I feel really proud of that. I think it's because our value statement is so simply stated, it’s a little bit different, and we work every day to make it meaningful. So, it’s really what people have gravitated around, and has definitely helped take the whole company forward.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>Seven Steps to Impactful Values.</b>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Make a serious commitment to your company values and to a comprehensive strategy for bringing them to life. This must be shared by the entire top team. If your main purpose is PR, don’t bother.</li>
        <li>With the full leadership team, identify your values – focusing on the basic, entry point ones and then on the differentiators, the two or three that distinguish you from your competitors and make your company stand out.</li>
        <li>Force yourselves to work hard on the language. Articulate your differentiating values in authentic words that resonate emotionally with your employees. Try telling stories about employees who have demonstrated your values. Find a great writer, ideally one who has written powerful headlines or tweets.</li>
        <li>For each of your differentiating values, write a short list of behaviors that support that value. Try to stick to positive behaviors rather than negative behaviors to avoid. The supporting behaviors should be crystal clear, actual ways staff can embody your values.</li>
        <li>Test the values, by getting the senior team to live them for 3-6 months before rolling them out across the company. During this period, develop messages that will remind employees about each of the behaviors, and why they are important. Any manager who won’t or can’t live by the values must be dismissed before rollout. Any hint of hypocrisy will kill the whole effort.</li>
        <li>When you are ready, invest 1-2 months to align your workforce with the refreshed values and associated behaviors. Present them as a draft and accept feedback and suggestions; be open to improvements, as staff perspectives are different and staff ownership is vital. Hold open “town hall” staff meetings to talk them over, with the leadership team and led by the CEO.</li>
        <li>Roll out the values companywide. Establish a cadence of touching on the values regularly. They should figure in recruitment interviews, be a part of every performance review and be a factor in compensation. Leadership must refer to them regularly, and routinely promote and develop specific behaviors. Staff at any level who don’t live the values should be shown the door. Staff who epitomize them should be highlighted for praise.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Overcoming people’s ingrained cynicism over corporate values is always a challenge. Settling on mundane values that offer no interest or engagement will go nowhere. Making values real takes a serious commitment of attention, creativity and time that can be difficult with so many other competing priorities. Above all, sustaining this commitment is critical, making sure that it is not just another leadership big idea to be overtaken by the next management shiny penny to drop.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Shared Values, Real Results.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Yet companies with a special culture that can express it in a fresh way with a real commitment can hone their values into an incredibly powerful and motivating force to build and sustain team coherence. Shared values, conveyed with real emotion and belief, have an extraordinary potential to draw in like-minded recruits and retain loyalty over time.</p>
      <p>“In 13 years as CEO, developing and promoting our company’s values has certainly been the single best thing I could have done,” says Schnieders. “If you talk about your values consistently enough, people know you're paying attention, they start living them, and then they become real.”</p>
