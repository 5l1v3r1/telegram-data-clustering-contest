      <p>The Portland Trail Blazers have confirmed the signing of 10-time NBA All-Star Carmelo Anthony - and could hand their latest addition his debut for the team on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Anthony has not featured in the league in over a year, since a short-lived spell with the Houston Rockets came to an end.</p>
      <p>However, the 35-year-old has played over 1,000 games in a career that has spanned 16 seasons since he was selected with the third overall pick in the 2003 draft.</p>
      <p>Anthony has previously played for the Denver Nuggets - the team who drafted him - as well as the New York Knicks and the Oklahoma City Thunder.</p>
      <p>"Carmelo is an established star in this league that will provide a respected presence in our locker room and a skill set at a position of need on the floor," said Neil Olshey, Portland's president of basketball operations.</p>
      <p>Anthony will wear number 00 for the Trail Blazers, who reached last season's Western Conference Finals but are struggling at 5-9 this year.</p>
      <p>The NBA's scoring champion for the 2012-13 campaign has been activated in time to feature against the New Orleans Pelicans.</p>
