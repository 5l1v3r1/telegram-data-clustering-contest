      <p>Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on November 19 told lawmakers that the country's state-run banks have reported frauds worth Rs 95,760 crore ($13.34 billion) in the first six months of FY20 ending March, news agency Reuters reported.</p>
      <p>Between April and September this year, as many as 5,743 cases of fraud were reported.</p>
      <p>"Government has taken comprehensive measures to curb the incidence of fraud in banks," FM Sitharaman told the Rajya Sabha.</p>
      <p>The measures included the freezing of 3,38,000 bank accounts of inoperative companies in the last two financial years in addition to the enactment of a law with a provision to confiscate the property of economic offenders, Reuters reported.</p>
      <p>Going by the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) annual report for FY19 released earlier this year, cases of frauds reported by banks went up by 15 percent on a year-on-year basis from 2018-19.</p>
      <p>As per the report, the sector reported 6,801 frauds cases which amounted to a loss of Rs 71,542.93 crore in FY19. This was higher than the 5,916 cases reported in FY18, which caused a loss of Rs 41,167.04 crore in FY18.</p>
      <p>Public sector banks, which constitute the largest market share in bank lending, accounted for the bulk of frauds reported in 2018-19, according to the central bank's report.</p>
