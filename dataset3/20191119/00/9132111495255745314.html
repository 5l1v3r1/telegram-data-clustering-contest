      <p>Ghanaians should brace themselves for load shedding otherwise known as Dumsor as Ghana is set to lose the Akosombo Dam and other important national assets to the Independent Western Togoland which is purported to have split from the country last Sunday.</p>
      <p>Shadow information and Spokesperson of the Separatist group, George Nyakpo, speaking on Accra-based radio station monitored by MyNewsGh.com revealed that the Akosombo Dam among other identifiable establishments fall within the territory of the 56th African country nation and as a result, they will own it and determine who to give power to.</p>
      <p>He hinted that the currency of the new country will soon be outdoored and an interim government named to steer the affairs of the newly independent Western Togoland.</p>
      <p>The Homeland Study Group Foundation declared independence for the Volta, and parts of the Northern, North Eastern and Upper East Regions after its meeting held in Ho last Sunday.</p>
      <p>However, these areas appear to have some establishments that belong to Ghana but the new group reveals that it will speak with authorities in Ghana to chart a new path on the latest development.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Mr. Charles Kormi Kudzodzi, the 80-year-old Homeland Study Group Foundation (HSGF), who championed the partitioning of the Volta Region as an independent state is currently on bail by the Accra High Court 2 in the sum of GH¢250,000.</p>
      <p>He was granted bail with two sureties, one of whom should be justified, to an amount of GH¢250000 for him to report twice to the investigators on Mondays and Thursdays.</p>

      <p>The other seven, including Besa Amedeus Akorli, Blay Kaku Freeman, Nkpe Tornye Kudjo, Thomson Tsigbe, Agbenyega Akudzi, Dzereke Kofi and Benjamin Agbodzagah who were remanded into Prison custody have since been released</p>
      <p>All eight are facing charges of conspiracy to commit crime to wit treason felony contrary to section 23(1) and 182 (b)of the Criminal offences Act, 1960(Act 29).</p>
      <p>It is unclear if they will still be making appearances in Ghana in view of the fact that they have declared their independence in what many described as the joke of the century.</p>
