      <p>The US has shifted its position on Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank, no longer viewing them as inconsistent with international law.</p>
      <p>US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the status of the West Bank was for Israelis and Palestinians to negotiate.</p>

      <p>Israel immediately welcomed the move - a reversal of the US position under Trump's predecessor Barack Obama.</p>
      <p>Settlements are communities established by Israel on land occupied in the 1967 Middle East war.</p>
      <p>They have long been a source of dispute between Israel and the international community, and the Palestinians, who swiftly condemned the move.</p>
