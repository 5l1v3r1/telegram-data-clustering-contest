        <b>I'M COMING OUT! To Cork and Dublin to see Diana Ross!</b>
      </p>
      <p>In the latest in a series of high-profile names recently announced for Ireland -- like <a href="https://www.irishpost.com/entertainment/lionel-richie-announces-concerts-dublin-belfast-part-hello-2020-tour-173486">Lionel Richie,</a> <a href="https://www.irishpost.com/news/killers-announce-dublin-malahide-castle-gig-173896">The Killers</a> and <a href="https://www.irishpost.com/entertainment/farewell-yellow-brick-road-elton-john-announces-new-irish-date-last-ever-tour-172046">Elton John</a> to name just a few--  the legendary Diana Ross has confirmed she will play not one, but two massive concerts on the Emerald Isle next year.</p>
      <p>The 75-year-old Motown legend will hit both Cork and Dublin in June 2020, performing at the iconic IMMA Royal Hospital Kilmainham in Dublin on Friday the 26th of June and headlining the Live At The Marquee Festival in Cork on Thursday 25th of June.</p>

      <p>The Irish summer shows make up part of the global superstar's <i>Top of the World </i>world tour, where she will also stop off at in Glastonbury in England to headline the annual festival in the Legend Slot (A huge achievement but an understatement nonetheless!).</p>
      <p>Aiken Promotions announced the two upcoming Irish shows this morning, describing Diana as "one of the most successful recording artists and entertainers of all time"-- which is again an understatement but is definitely a good indication of how quick the tickets are going to sell out.</p>
      <p>Tickets for both shows go on sale next Monday, November 25th at 9am, so there's only a short 7-month wait once you've gotten your hands on the golden tickets.</p>
      <p>Worth it.</p>
