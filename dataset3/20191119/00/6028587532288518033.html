      <p>As the Democratic National Committee invariably obsess over locations when choosing presidential debate locales (curiously, and unlike Republicans, they never seem to settle on presidential libraries), let’s spend a moment on <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/19/entertainment/tyler-perry-studios/index.html">Atlanta’s Tyler Perry Studios</a>, the host for Wednesday night’s 10-candidate fun-fest.The television show <a href="https://www.bet.com/shows/tyler-perrys-the-oval.html"><i>The Oval</i></a>, which runs Wednesday evenings on the BET television network, is filmed on this studio’s grounds. The candidates won’t have to go far to find a replica of the White House’s West Wing.</p>
      <p>If they came back in a couple of weeks, they’d encounter <a href="https://www.blackenterprise.com/tyler-perry-studios-will-host-2019-miss-universe-pageant/">this year’s Miss Universe competition</a> – yes, the same beauty pageant <a href="https://www.forbes.com/pictures/fehf45gflk/1996-trump-buys-the-mis/#789eebe16ada">once owned by President Trump</a>.</p>
      <p>As for the pageantry on display Wednesday night in Atlanta, which may not be as beautiful as it is tedious (mercifully, only two hours this time), a few thoughts:</p>
      <p><b>Welcome To The (Im)Peach State</b>. We seem to go through this folly with every debate – the choice of location pertaining to a potentially influential state in 2020 (Florida, Michigan, Texas, Ohio, now Georgia); yet the moderators, coming from the nation’s capital, giving the proceedings a decidedly “swampy” feel.</p>
      <p>Will Wednesday night be any different?</p>
      <p>Here’s a simple way to decide: use your smartphone’s stopwatch to time how many minutes are devoted to Trump impeachments vs. more Georgia-centric topics like health care (currently <a href="https://www.ajc.com/blog/politics/opinion-georgia-health-care-just-became-the-make-break-issue-2020/kx8MMaV64xX3NyR9fn74WL/">a bone of contention</a> with Georgia state lawmakers).</p>
      <p>My guess: impeachment trumps Peach State politics. As it likely will again at December’s debate in Southern California.</p>
      <p><b>Who’s Gone With The Wind? </b>The most famous novel and movie pertaining to Atlanta (sorry, <i>Baby Driver </i>fans) begs this question: how many of the 10 Democrats can exit the stage on Wednesday night and optimistically offer, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-OoIvgtuzs">“Tomorrow is another day”</a>?</p>
      <p>This is especially true of California Sen. Kamala Harris, who in the past few days has had to endure calls for <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kamala-harris-three-percent-michael-bloomberg-campaign-manager-call-resignation-rodriguez-iowa">her campaign manager’s resignation</a> – and even the candidate herself <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/california-playbook/2019/11/18/kamalas-fate-cadem-convention-highlights-california-shuns-trump-aligned-carmakers-katie-hills-heros-welcome-schiff-rallies-dems-487697">withdrawing from the race</a> before she goes deep into debt (I contributed to this week’s media grave-shoveling with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/11/19/californians-could-have-told-you-harris-wasnt-real-deal/">this <i>Washington Post</i> column</a> suggesting that Harris’ problem is the same as her showcased Oakland – <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-gertrude-steins-no-there-there-is-everywhere-1517589198">“no there there.”</a>)</p>
      <p>Other Democrats on this debate stage seem to be near-certain casualties before or soon after Iowa – New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar come to mind.</p>
      <p>But it’s Harris who bears watching because (a) she was <a href="https://www.axios.com/kamala-harris-joe-biden-2020-poll-bb7e0a27-6e27-4633-bb7b-3a4b665485a7.html">the breakout star</a> of the first debate back in June; (c) this debate’s African-American overtones and the proximity to South Carolina, <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/campaign-chronicles/kamala-harriss-last-stand-in-iowa">once a key to Harris’ fortunes</a>; and (c) if she soon exits the race, it’s yet another cautionary tale of <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/836554/beto-orourke-may-have-peaked-early">peaking too early</a>.</p>
      <p><b>Georgia – And South Carolina – On His Mind?</b> The flip side to the question of why Harris struggles to remain viable: South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg’s surge built almost entirely upon <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/11/18/most-important-question-pete-buttigieg-isnt-what-happens-iowa/">lilywhite support</a> – and the question of what’s in store for his candidacy if he can’t catch on with minority voters beyond Iowa and New Hampshire.</p>
      <p>How much of a minority problem does Buttigieg have at present? <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/south-carolina/release-detail?ReleaseID=3649">Here’s</a> a Quinnipiac Poll showing the South Bend mayor doing worse than “spiritual-transformation” lodestar Marianne Williamson (<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/marianne-williamson-institute-president-run-2020-primary-907441/">“They’re going to miss me. Hashtag <i>Boring Without Her</i>”</a>) among black voters in South Carolina, the scene of an influential February primary.</p>
      <p>The good news for Mayor Pete ( if you can call it that): the same poll showed 60% of black voters didn’t have an opinion as to his candidacy. </p>
      <p>Maybe that’s why Buttigieg spent part of his debate walk-up giving a speech <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2019-11-18/buttigieg-visits-morehouse-in-effort-to-build-black-support">at historically-black Morehouse College</a>.</p>
      <p><b>Does “Woke” Joe Wake Up?</b> Former Joe Biden will have a prominent friend at this debate: Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who’s <a href="https://www.amestrib.com/news/20191021/atlanta-mayor-visits-ames-to-open-biden-campaign-office">campaigned in Iowa</a> on Biden’s behalf.</p>
      <p>As for how Biden fits in with this Georgia crowd: <a href="https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/driving-miss-daisy-1990"><i>Driving Miss Daisy</i></a> comes to mind – the tale of an elderly Atlanta matriarch coming to terms with a world changing around her.</p>
      <p>Just how “woke” Biden intends to be in this debate – playing up his support among black voters, extolling the virtues of the New South in transitional Atlanta, referring to “my friend, Barack” – is much-watch television. Then again, how much of presence will he be given the recent surges by Buttigieg and Warren?</p>
      <p>Speaking of whom . . .  </p>
      <p><b>The Scarlet W</b>. In the aforementioned Ohio debate, Elizabeth Warren played the part of Scarlet O’Hara – a heroine under siege not from marauding Yankees but the likes of <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2019/10/16/ohio-debate-attacks-demonstrate-elizabeth-warren-new-role-democrat-beat/guEXKzTAay71csUEbHE3VP/story.html">Biden and Beto O’Rourke</a> (remember him?) poking holes in her various policy stances.</p>
      <p>If Warren wants to regain the momentum she had going into last month’s debate, it starts with the senator stepping up her game (by the way, not being stuck in a month-long Senate impeachment, <a href="http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/11/impeachment-trial-a-problem-for-prez-candidates-in-senate.html">as the Iowa vote approaches</a>, would also help).</p>
      <p>On the Ohio stage, she wasn’t <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/17/elizabeth-warren-did-not-win-the-debate-and-now-shes-got-work-to-do.html">suitably forceful</a> when explaining how she’ll pay for her ambitious healthcare scheme (“costs will come down” doesn’t cut it). If Warren’s going to stick with the line that working-class taxes won’t rise, she needs to do a better job of presenting the math.</p>
      <p>To the old southern adage that when you die, regardless of your final destination, <a href="https://spinditty.com/playlists/Pop-Rock-and-Country-Songs-About-Georgia">you have to go through Atlanta first</a>, this debate seems apt: depending on one’s political preference, prepare for two hours of Heaven or Hell.</p>
