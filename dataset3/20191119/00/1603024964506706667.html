      <p>Reliance Industries became the first company among listed entities on exchanges, to hit a market capitalisation of Rs 9.5 lakh crore. The stock rallied 3.4 percent intraday and crossed Rs 1,500 mark for the first time on November 18, after the rival Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel decided to increase prices with effect from December 1, 2019.</p>
      <p>Expectations are that the increase in tariffs by competitors could benefit Jio by adding more users as users generally prefer to go to telecom operator which has lowest tariff rate along with strong network. So far, Reliance Jio has not announced any price hike like rivals.</p>
