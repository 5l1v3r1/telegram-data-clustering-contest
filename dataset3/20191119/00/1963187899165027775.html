      <p>CAIRO â€“ 19 November 2019: German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier commended on Monday the pivotal role played by Egypt to boost stability in the Middle East and Africa, especially with regard to combating illegal migration and terrorism. <br/><br/>This came during Steinmeier's meeting with President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi at Belle Vue presidential headquarters in Berlin, a statement by Presidential spokesman Bassam Rady said on Monday. <br/><br/>The statement added that President Sisi held extended talks with his German counterpart, during which the Egyptian leader praised relations between Cairo and, which he said have strengthened to a high level over the past years. <br/><br/>Sisi also expressed his appreciation for Germany's handing over of an ancient 19<sup>th</sup> century Atlas. <br/><br/>In October, Egyptian Culture Minister Inas Abdel Dayem received the ancient relic from Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry and his German counterpart Heiko Mass in the presence of Hisham Azmi, president of the Egyptian National Library and Archives. <br/><br/>Steinmeier also hailed the steps that Egypt adopted to reform its economy, and the mega national projects that are being extensively erected in the country. <br/><br/>He asserted Germany's keenness to support Egypt's development efforts in all fields through joint investments. <br/><br/>The meeting also tackled some regional and international issues of common interest, in particular the Libyan and Syrian crises, the spokesman said. <br/><br/>The two leaders also discussed the Palestinian cause, with both of them agreeing on the need to reach a just and comprehensive solution in accordance with relevant international terms of reference.</p>
