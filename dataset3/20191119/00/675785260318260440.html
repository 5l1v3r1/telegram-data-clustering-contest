      <p>Child killers will be locked up for life under plans outlined by the Government.</p>
      <p>The Tories pledged to end the system which sees murderers of youngsters become eligible for parole after they have served the minimum tariff set by a sentencing judge.</p>
      <p>While courts are duty-bound to set mandatory life terms, most murderers do not serve the rest of their lives behind bars.</p>
      <p>However, under the shake up planned by <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> , adults who commit pre-meditated child murder will remain in jail until they die, with no chance of release.</p>
      <p>Justice Secretary Robert Buckland, a former crown court judge, said: “There can be no more sickening injustice than that of heartbroken parents watching the killer of their child walk free.</p>

      <p>“That’s why under a Conservative majority Government the law will be rewritten to be absolutely clear: any murderer who denies a young, innocent child the right to life surrenders their own right to liberty.</p>
      <p>“They do so permanently, and they do so without exception.</p>
      <p>“There is nothing we can do to take away the pain of the families of murdered children so we must do everything in our power not to compound it.”</p>
