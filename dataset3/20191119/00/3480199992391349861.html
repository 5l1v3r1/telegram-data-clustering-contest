      <p>Liz Bonnin has said she stopped eating red meat after making a BBC documentary about the impact of meat production on the planet.</p>
      <p>The presenter said she did not make a conscious decision to change her diet after making Meat: A Threat To Our Planet?, but just lost her taste for it.</p>
      <p>She said: “I was already eating very little amount of meat and I was conscious of buying organic, although organic has its own challenges.</p>
      <p>“I think for me what the documentary did was I’ve stopped eating red meat altogether.</p>
      <p>“I think, we were discussing it all through the making of the programme, it wasn’t even a stage of going ‘I must’.</p>

      <p>“I just naturally have lost the taste for it at the moment.”</p>
      <p>Bonnin said a feedlot (a type of animal feeding operation) in the US and a intensive pig farm had a part to play.</p>
      <p>She said: “I saw these pigs in the barns and that was it for me.</p>
      <p>“I think it’s just propelled an inherent instinct without a big old ‘right, that’s it, I must force myself not to’ – it’s just happened really naturally that I just don’t feel I need to eat red meat.”</p>
      <p>The 43-year-old said she could “see myself getting into complete vegetarianism very soon”.</p>
      <p>She said: “I was at a climate talk with Chris Packham yesterday, he was talking about how it’s a stage thing for most people the more they learn.</p>
      <p>“I think that’s part of the message here – we’re not telling people what to do and to turn vegetarian, but I think inherently we are evolving in our understanding of how our relationship with the planet potentially needs a little bit of a harder look and I think if we can just make gradual changes, it will go a long way.”</p>
      <p>Meat: A Threat To Our Planet? airs on BBC One on Monday, November 25.</p>
