      <p>Comedian Jim Moir has admitted he does not like British comedies such as Fleabag.</p>
      <p>The star, better known by his stage name Vic Reeves, told Radio Times magazine he usually gives comedies “a three-minute glance” before deciding whether he likes them and that it’s “usually not”.</p>
      <p>“I don’t really like British comedy,” he said.</p>
      <p>“What’s that one that people seem to like so much? Fleabag. I watched that and it was that sort of Oxbridge ‘Oh, I’m so clever and witty, aren’t I?’</p>
      <p>“I don’t like that stuff.</p>
      <p>“But then I don’t like Mrs Brown’s Boys either. I like things that are clever but hide it.”</p>
      <p>This week’s Radio Times is out on Tuesday.</p>
