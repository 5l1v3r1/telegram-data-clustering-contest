      <p>Xiaomi’s Xiao Ai voice assistant is getting a major update. Announced during Xiaomi’s own MIDC develop conference, Xiao Ai 3.0 brings a male voice option, and adds “naturally continuous dialogue” for smartphone users. This is much like how you can speak to Google Assistant and ask it follow up questions with the previous answers as context.</p>

      <p>As per <i>GizChina</i> you'll be able to speak to the voice assistant and interrupt it to start a new command. Currently, it's only supported by the Xiaomi Mi 9 Pro 5G and Xiaomi Mi 9.</p>
      <p>Xiaomi has continually invested in R&amp;D for its voice platform and today, MiNLP (Xiaomi’s natural language processing platform) is activated over 6 billion times a day.</p>
      <p>Xiaomi’s own voice assistant platform first launched in the first half of last year, debuting with the Xiaomi MI Mix 2S. Of course, Xiaomi’s voice assistant platform is intended for the Chinese market and managed to clock 49.9 million monthly active users after a little over a year.</p>

      <p>With MIUI 11, Xiaomi is integrating an earthquake alert warning system for phones on MIUI 11 and Mi TV devices within seconds of the arrival of the first quake wave. The system first launched on September 20 in testing phase and Xiaomi will soon expand the program to all of mainland China.</p>
      <p>Looking to 2020, Xiaomi plans to launch more than 10 5G-ready smartphones and looks forward to further define the “Smart Home to all” with its massive IoT business.</p>
