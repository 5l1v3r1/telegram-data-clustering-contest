      <h2>Check out next season's provisional entry lists for all three classes</h2>

      <p>The official entry lists for the 2020 MotoGP™, Moto2™ and Moto3™ World Championships have been announced. All three classes feature important changes throughout, Whilst Moto2™ and Moto3™ have team changes too. From Alex Marquez moving to the Repsol Honda Team in the premier class to swaps at Leopard Racing in Moto3™, there’s plenty to get used to as 2020 commences.</p>
      <p>The MotoGP™ grid is now confirmed, with Alex Marquez graduating to Repsol Honda last night. From Cervera, he takes over the ride left vacant by Jorge Lorenzo and joins his brother Marc in 2020. The other two new recruits come from KTM, with the arrival of Brad Binder within the official team. The South African, who now sports the No. 33, was initially recruited by the Red Bull KTM Tech3 Team, so the structure led by Hervé Poncharal has decided to turn to Iker Lecuona to accompany Miguel Oliveira, with the Spaniard replacing the Portuguese rider during Valencian round.</p>
