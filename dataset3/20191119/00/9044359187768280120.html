      <p>During his guesting in Kapuso ArtisTambayan on Monday, November 19, Direk Bitoy stressed that aspiring filmmakers should study the whole process of doing a movie.</p>
      <p>He added that getting a mentor would also be beneficial to help you in the learning process.</p>
      <p>“The best lesson or best advice that I can give you is to actually study,</p>
      <p>“Pag-aralan ninyo kasi hindi basta-basta pinapasok itong filmmaking. Marami sa atin, hindi man lang nagka-crash course sa pagpasok sa paggawa ng pelikula.</p>
      <p>“I would suggest na magkaroon ka ng mentor para talagang maituro sa iyo ‘yung tamang paraan ng paggawa ng pelikula, hindi talaga basta-basta.”</p>
      <p>Michael V. released his first film <i>Family History</i> last July a joint-production with Mic Test Entertainment and GMA Pictures.</p>
