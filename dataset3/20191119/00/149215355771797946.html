      <h1>Trump administration official resigns after report shows she inflated her résumé</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:18:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 00:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://theweek.com/authors/catherine-garcia" target="_blank">Catherine Garcia</a></address>
      <p>Mina Chang, the deputy assistant secretary in the State Department's Bureau of Conflict and Stability Operations, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/senior-trump-admin-official-mina-chang-resigns-after-nbc-news-n1085186">resigned on Monday,</a> just a few hours after NBC News asked her spokeswoman about several false claims Chang made about her nonprofit and education.</p>
      <p>In her resignation letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Chang said she was "unfairly maligned, unprotected by my superiors, and exposed to a media with an insatiable desire for gossip and scandal, genuine or otherwise." She also said her resignation is actually "a protest," and not "surrender, because I will not surrender my commitment to serve, my fidelity to the truth, or my love of country."</p>
      <p>NBC News <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/senior-trump-official-embellished-resume-had-face-fake-time-cover-n1080356">reported last week</a> that she embellished her résumé, claiming among other things that she was a "graduate" of a program at the Army War College, when she actually just attended a four-day seminar. Chang also showed people a <i>Time</i> cover with her face on it, which a magazine spokesperson said was "not authentic."</p>
      <p>Since that report, NBC News uncovered more falsehoods. Chang said in 2012, she won a CBS Humanitarian of the Year Women That Soar award, but it was actually a Dallas, Texas, honor, and the ceremony aired on a local CBS affiliate. Chang also said she earned a degree in international development from the University of Hawaii, but that program does not exist. She visited Afghanistan in 2015, saying it was a humanitarian mission facilitated through her nonprofit Linking the World, but NBC News reports the trip was paid for by a defense contractor, no aid was delivered, and she lied about the people she met.
