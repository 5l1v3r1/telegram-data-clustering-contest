        <i>“The fight started on Thursday, but the police were able to chase the hoodlums away. On Friday night, they reinforced and started vandalising vehicles. We were hearing the sound of vehicles being smashed with cutlasses and hammers, and they also robbed people.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>“Two vehicles belonging to my customers were vandalised. I will have to foot the bill of repairing the vehicles. The hoodlums even came back on Saturday, but we the residents had to defend ourselves and chased them away, because they had already done a lot of damage.”</p>

      <p>Abubakar stated, <i>“The windscreens of vehicles that they destroyed were over 200. We were just hearing sound around midnight and residents, who peeped through their windows, estimated that the hoodlums were over 30 and were armed with cutlasses, torch lights and other weapons, with which they vandalised the vehicles.”</i></p>
