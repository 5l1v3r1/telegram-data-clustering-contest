      <p>ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan paid almost Rs4.7 million in taxes between 1981 and 2017, during which he was exempted from paying taxes for a few years, and also paid taxes of only a few hundred rupees in some other years, documents reveal.</p>
      <p>The highest ever taxes paid by PM Imran were in 2010, when he paid Rs1, 883,033 in total to tax authorities. Similarly, the second highest income tax amount paid by the premier was Rs562,554 in the year 2011.</p>
      <p>Babar Sattar, counsel for Justice Qazi Faez Isa in a court case, on Monday raised questions and highlighted that for some years his client’s (Justice Faez Isa) wife had paid even more tax than Prime Minister Imran Khan.</p>
      <p>He mentioned the 2017 annual tax returns, when the premier had paid Rs103,763 in taxes to the government. The counsel argued before the Supreme Court that a person who paid a small amount of tax had no right to raise fingers at others.</p>
      <p>Geo News has carried out a probe to determine the amount of tax paid by PM Imran since he was registered as a taxpayer in Pakistan. The probe also attempts to answer whether PM Imran has declared the properties owned by his former wives? </p>
      <p>The same question was raised by Justice Qazi Faez Isa in a letter to the President of Pakistan after a reference was filed against the Supreme Court judge on the advice of Prime Minister Imran.</p>
      <p>A careful examination of the last 25 years of tax record of PM Imran shows that, as against the principle set by the Prime Minister Office in a recent reference against the Supreme Court judge, the premier himself never declared the bank accounts or the foreign assets held by his children or former wives, even during the years corresponding to their married life.</p>
      <p>The President of Pakistan, on the recommendations of the Prime Minister Office, sent a reference to the Supreme Judicial Counci lSJC) against Supreme Court judge Justice Qazi Faez Isa alleging that Justice Isa had not declared assets held by his wife and children in the United Kingdom and thus, should be sent home. </p>
      <p>In his letter to the President, Justice Isa had maintained that his wife and children were not dependent on him, living in the UK, and he was not under any obligation to declare assets held by them. </p>
      <p>Keeping in the view the complaint of the Prime Minister office, scrutiny of tax record of the premier shows that he never declared any foreign bank accounts or assets held by his wife Jemima Goldsmith during the years of their marriage. </p>
      <p>Not only this, PM Imran also never declared any foreign bank accounts or foreign assets held by his two sons, who are now 23 and 20 years old. Imran did the same in cases of his second wife Reham Khan and third wife Bushra Maneka.</p>
      <p>PM Imran had married Jemima Goldsmith on June 21, 1995. Both separated through a divorce on June 22, 2004. Under the principle defined by the Prime Minister Office, PM Imran was supposed to declare all the bank accounts and foreign properties held in the name of Jemima Goldsmith in the tax years 1994-95 (Financial Year ending June 30, 1995) to the year 2003-04 (Financial Year ending June 30, 2004). </p>
      <p>However, a careful examination of his tax record of the said period reveals that PM Imran never declared any bank account or asset held by Jemima Goldsmith in the UK. Not only this, but PM Imran also did not disclose the assets held by his two sons, Sulaiman (born 1996) and Kasim (born 1999) in his tax returns. </p>
      <p>PM Imran Khan had announced his marriage to Reham Khan on January 6, 2015 and divorced her on October 30, 2015. He was supposed to declare bank accounts and other assets in the name of Reham Khan, locally or abroad, in his annual Tax Returns for the years 2014-15 (Financial Year ending June 30, 2015) and 2015-16 (Financial Year ending June 30, 2016). However, the premier chose not to do that. </p>
      <p>PM Imran announced his marriage with Bushra Maneka on February 18, 2018. Under the principle defined by his office, he was supposed to declare assets in the name of Bushra Maneka in the annual tax returns and Wealth Statement for the tax year 2017-18 (Financial Year ending June 30, 2018). However, he only mentioned that, as he was recently married (marriage took place some five months earlier), so he was not annexing her details.</p>
      <p>Following are the declarations made in the Wealth Statement annexed with the annual tax returns PM Imran filed with Federal Bureau of Revenue (FBR) in the years corresponding to married life of Imran Khan with Jemima Goldsmith;</p>
