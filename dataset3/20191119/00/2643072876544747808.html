      <h1>Jonathan’s Team Speaks On His Defection To APC</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Enioluwa Adeniyi</a></address>
      <p>The alleged report claiming that the former President, <a href="https://www.naijanews.com/topic/goodluck-jonathan/"><u><b>Goodluck Jonathan</b></u></a> has concluded plans to defect from the Peoples Democratic Party to the All Progressives Congress has been debunked by his media team.</p>
      <p>Following the reported disagreement between the Bayelsa State Governor, <b>Seriake Dickson</b> and the former President, there have been speculations that Jonathan supported the candidate of APC, <a href="http://www.naijanews.com/2019/11/18/what-jonathan-said-after-inec-declared-apcs-lyon-winner-of-bayelsa-election/"><u><b>David Lyon</b> </u></a>in the November 16 governorship election and also celebrated his victory.</p>
      <p>A former aide to the former President, Reno Omokri has however described the ex-President as a loyal party member.</p>
      <p>Reno Omokri in a statement said,<i> “Former President Goodluck Jonathan is a member of the Peoples Democratic Party. Throughout his sojourn on Earth, he has been a member of only one political party.”</i></p>
      <p>
        <i>“Dr Jonathan is known for his stability and loyalty. These are character traits that have been lifelong companions of his. He is also an elder statesman and that role requires that he accepts all Nigerian citizens, and indeed all the world’s peoples, in the spirit of the brotherhood of man”.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“As an elder statesman and Chairman of the Goodluck Jonathan Foundation, Dr Jonathan will receive people of goodwill who apply to pay him a courtesy visit, irrespective of their political or religious leanings. Though a Christian, he has received Muslim groups and other diverse visitors.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“Dr Jonathan intends to devote the rest of his life on Earth to building unity, and engendering opportunity for Nigerians and Africans and he has no desire or reason to engage in partisan politics beyond being a loyal member of the Peoples Democratic Party.”</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>“His being a member of the Peoples Democratic Party is institutional. In fact, it is more accurate to state that his eternal party is Nigeria, for which he reminds all Nigerians that they are brothers and sisters born from the womb of one Nigeria.”</i>
