      <p>Lebanese-Ghanaian New Patriotic Party (NPP) activist and author Fadi Samih Dabbousi has opened his tap of insults on opposition NDC firebrand communicator Sammy Gyamfi, MyNewsGh.com reports.</p>
      <p>The writer who days ago told the U.S government “to shove its $190million PDS cash into their anus” says Sammy Gyamfi is a foolish boy and a rat who wears diapers.</p>
      <p>Mr. Dabbousi was reacting to Sammy Gyamfi’s much touted press conference on family and friends inside the Akufo-Addo government.</p>
      <p>“Let this preamble resonate loudly in the ears of foolish boys like Sammy Gyamfi and his sponsors that, “nothing is as unnationalistic, unpatriotic, and ungodly than for a humiliated sitting President defeated at the polls to award his brother approximately $650 billion US Dollars’ worth of Ghana’s Bauxite barely 5 days prior to handing over Power to the most responsible President ever to debut onto the political stage of our dear nation as President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo.” Fadi Dabbousi wrote.</p>
      <p>Without any evidence, Fadi alleged some irregularity under Inusah ‘Fusseini’ as Roads Minister calling on Sammy Gyamfi to check that one out too.</p>
      <p>“I want to tell that foolish boy, Sammy Gyamfi, that John Mahama’s sister was alleged to be the terror of the Ministry of Roads and Highways at the time of Inusah Fusseini, that same person who made the headlines having paid an artiste a whopping 150 thousand Ghana Cedis to perform at a rally when his people could not even afford “wagashi”. A large budget was carved out of the Ministry specifically to pay her for no work done.”</p>
      <p>According to Mr. Dabbousi, Sammy Gyamfi is a rat.</p>
      <p>“This rat, Sammy Gyamfi, should understand that when the 2012 elections were rigged by the NDC, John Mahama and Hanna Tetteh were said to have been evacuated in shorts and underwear from their hideout at Dzorwulu West in an ambulance because demonstrators had blocked off the only escape route.”</p>
      <p>He added: Do not forget that John Mahama’s best friend, Oye Lithur, was given a ministerial post because she supposedly twerked for him one night at a private party. Keep in mind that most of the officials in close working circuit of John Mahama were either concubines, cuckolds, gays, or close family relatives, all incompetent at what they were posted to do.”</p>
      <p>Sammy Gyamfi has become a thorn in the flesh of the ruling government. He recently combined the triple forces of Kwaku Baako, Kofi Bentil and Gary Nimako and dribbled them in a news analysis show NewsFile.</p>
