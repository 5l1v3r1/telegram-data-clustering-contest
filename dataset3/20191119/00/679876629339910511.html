      <h1>The Lindis, Ahuriri Valley, New Zealand: Stellar new accommodation</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:48:10+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 00:48</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.traveller.com.au/julietta-jameson-hvf46" target="_blank">Julietta Jameson</a></address>
      <p>When The Lindis opened in New Zealand's Ahuriri Valley in January this year, it was immediately hailed as something special.</p>
      <p>Surrounded by national park and forest in this most picturesque part of North Otago, it sits in part of a rambling 2428-hectare station, 2.5 hours' drive from Queenstown.</p>
      <p>Opting to cut into a hillside so as to leave the South Island wilderness vistas virtually uninterrupted, Wellington's Architecture Workshop created the grandest of grand designs in a building of clever discreetness housing proper lodge luxury, with five suites and elegant communal spaces for dining and relaxing.</p>

      <p>Now, The Lindis has added three separate "pods", a short walk from the main facilities but a mile away in privacy.</p>
      <p>Clad in one-way mirror, these villas all but disappear into the landscape, yet from the inside, the accommodation seems to hover seamlessly in the landscape.</p>
      <p>Designed by architect Noel Martin, each measures 20 metres square and offers a sumptuous bed for two, en suite and an outdoor gas-heated tub on a private deck.</p>
      <p>The entire property adheres to sustainable principles, incorporating such features as geothermal heat pumps and rainwater harvesting systems.</p>
      <p>The accommodation may be stellar, but of course, the true star here is the great outdoors. The Lindis offers a range of activities (at extra cost), which, no surprise, include fly fishing. The Ahuriri River, upon which the lodge is situated, has been rated among the top five fly fishing locations in the world.</p>
      <p>The Pods cost $NZ2875 a night twin share and include daily pre-dinner drinks and canapes, multi-course dinner, breakfast, mini bar and self-guided activities.</p>
