      <p>CAIRO - 18 November 2019: Egypt launched 32 projects in Africa and organized more than 1,500 training activities for African youth and professionals in one year, a government report submitted to the Parliament indicated. <br/><br/>Moreover, Egypt started establishing three fisheries and a cattle farm in four African countries, Head of the Project of African Farms, affiliated with the Ministry of Agriculture, Maher Maghraby said on Sunday. <br/><br/>Egypt has started establishing fisheries in Algeria, Malawi and Zimbabwe, and a cattle farm in Uganda, Maghraby added in his speech at the meeting of the Parliament's African Affairs Committee, noting that the ministry has received requests from other African countries to establish similar projects. <br/><br/>As part of an initiative to develop the Nile Basin countries, the Arab Organization for Industrialization (AOI) is establishing three energy plants in Eritrea at a budget of $7 million, while the Ministry of Agriculture and Land Reclamation is establishing a joint farm, which is the seventh joint Egyptian-African farm. Six others were built in Democratic Congo, Mali, Tanzania, Zambia, Niger and Togo to cultivate crops, and breed livestock. <br/><br/>Egypt has also started constructing Stiegler's Gorge Dam in Tanzania, which will have a capacity of 2,100 Megawatts, and is meant to boost Tanzanian economy. The dam will be built by a coalition of The Arab Contractors Egyptian Company and El Sewedy Electric at a cost of $3.6 billion. Stiegler's Gorge Hydroelectric Power Station is expected to produce 5,920 GWh of power annually to fill the electricity and energy shortage in the country. <br/><br/>In September, Egypt launched an initiative to screen 1 million Africans for hepatitis C and provide treatment for patients starting with South Africa. <br/><br/>The report showing the government’s achievements between June 2018 and June 2019 is examined by 25 committees at the House of Representatives, including those of planning, education, health, workforce, religious affairs, industry, economy, agriculture, and housing. Each will prepare a report evaluating the government’s work and putting forward demands by November 20. The reports will be discussed by the plenary session in order to draft a final report.</p>
