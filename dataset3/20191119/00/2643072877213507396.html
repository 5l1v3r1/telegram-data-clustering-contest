      <p>The six students; Popoola Olaniyi, Faith Oluwadare, Jessica Nandi, Emmanuella Ajuwon, Emmanuel Taiwo and Cecilia Alao allegedly dehumanized Boluwatife Adekunle for allegedly gossiping about one of them in a hostel outside the institution.</p>
      <p>The school itself has also placed an indefinite suspension on the six students.</p>
      <p>According to the Spokesman for the police in the state Femi Joseph, the state Commissioner of Police Undie Adie had ordered the Divisional Police Officer in charge of the area to look into the matter.</p>
      <p>He said that he had watched the disgusting video of the incident and the CP has ordered that the six students should be prosecuted. So, whatever the university does on the matter the students will still face prosecution.</p>
      <p><b>Naija News</b> learnt that a disciplinary committee was set up by the university to look into the case while the students would miss the second-semester examination which began on Monday.</p>
      <p>According to a source, if the students are found guilty they would be expelled.</p>
      <p>The Deputy Director of the Corporate Communications of the institution, Adegbenro Adebanjo, who confirmed the incident said that the students would face a disciplinary committee set up by the school.</p>
      <p>He said further that the fate of the accused depends on the decision of the panel as they will be invited by the panel to defend themselves and ordered that the suspended students must not be seen in the campus till when told.</p>
