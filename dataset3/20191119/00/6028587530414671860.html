      <h1>PornHub And Porn Stars Could Be About To Give Bitcoin A Surprise Boost</h1>

      <p>The pornography industry has long been known to herald new technological directions–and it could be about to lead the way in bitcoin and cryptocurrency (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2019/11/16/perhaps-google-will-kill-bitcoin-after-all/">unless Google kills bitcoin first</a>). In the 1970s the adult entertainment industry helped VHS to victory over Betamax in the video format wars. Long before YouTube and Netflix brought in autoplaying videos they were already typical on PornHub and similar adult video sites.</p>
      <p>Now, after Pornhub last week revealed online payments processor PayPal will no longer support payments for the adult site, thousands of porn stars could turn to bitcoin and cryptocurrencies to get paid.</p>

      <p>PayPal stopped payment support to Pornhub’s models on Thursday last week after it found the adult entertainment website made "certain" payments without the permission of the payment processor.</p>
      <p>"Following a review, we have discovered that Pornhub has made certain business payments through PayPal without seeking our permission. We have taken action to stop these transactions from occurring," PayPal said in a statement.</p>
      <p>Pornhub said it was "devastated by PayPal’s decision to stop payouts to over a hundred thousand performers who rely on them for their livelihoods."</p>
      <p>In <a href="https://www.pornhub.com/blog/9122">a blog post</a>, Pornhub directed models to set up a new payment method, with instructions on how PayPal users can transfer pending payments.</p>
      <p>Pornhub has already begun experimenting with cryptocurrencies, with the site accepting the digital token verge in April last year and then adding bitcoin rivals tron and horizen. Pornhub currently only pays out to performers in verge.</p>
      <p>"We ... are evaluating adding other cryptocurrency payout options," Corey Price, a vice president at Pornhub, told bitcoin and cryptocurrency industry news outlet <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/paypals-axing-of-pornhub-model-payments-may-boost-verge-crypto">CoinDesk</a> following the PayPal ban.</p>
      <p>Following the surprise PayPal decision, the Verge Currency team wrote a guide for Pornhub users and models to switch to verge.</p>
      <p>Verge's value, which has been on a steady downward trend since the epic 2017 bitcoin and crypto bull run, jumped by over 30% on Thursday before giving up much of its gains over the weekend.</p>
      <p>"For years, PayPal has been moralizing on who can receive payments, leading to today, removing the right of adult entertainers on their platform," an editor at Verge Currency wrote in a Medium <a href="https://medium.com/vergecurrency/ditch-paypal-get-paid-in-verge-currency-xvg-4e7f96bc13b0">post</a>.</p>
      <p>PayPal is among many major banks, payment providers and financial companies, that prohibit sexual services in their terms and conditions, with reports suggesting the likes of Visa, Mastercard, JP Morgan Chase, and Stripe, have all booted sex workers from their platforms.</p>
      <p>"Decisions like that of PayPal and other major companies do nothing but harm efforts to end discrimination and stigma towards sex workers," a Pornhub spokesperson told culture outlet <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/d3abgv/paypal-pulls-out-of-pornhub-payments">Vice</a>'s tech site, Motherboard.</p>

        <figcaption>Pornhub users can currently use cryptocurrencies verge, tron and horizen when they sign up for the ... [+] premium site. Many bitcoin users have long called for other major cryptocurrencies to be added as payment options.<cite>Pornhub</cite></figcaption>

      <p>The problem of so-called "de-platforming" controversial or undesirable users from payments companies is not limited to the pornography industry.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/billybambrough/2019/02/28/alex-jones-preposterous-poster-boy-for-bitcoin/#1a9fe8da281b">conspiracy theorist and provocator Alex Jones, best known for once denying the Sandy Hook school shooting, complained he had been blacklisted by banks and financial companies</a>.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Mastercard activist shareholders earlier this year called for a "human rights committee" to monitor and prevent money flowing to hate groups though the company, a proposal Mastercard shot down.</p>
      <p>However, bitcoin and crypto’s clunky user experience and long setup process has already caused those in the adult entertainment industry hit by PayPal's Pornhub decision to complain.</p>
      <p>"Crypto, personal portal… LOL. I don’t understand what that even is," Pornhub performer Shyla Jennings said via <a href="https://twitter.com/shylajdotcom/status/1194823038228934659">Twitter</a> in response to suggestions she should accept bitcoin and other digital tokens. "I’m cool with just direct deposit into my bank account."</p>
      <p>Bitcoin and crypto may be for everyone, but the industry needs to prioritize making access and acceptance easier.</p>
