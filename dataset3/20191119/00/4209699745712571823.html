      <p>Salome Abuh, Peoples Democratic Party women leader in Ochadamu Ward under Ofu Local Government Area of Kogi State has been set ablaze in her home, the police has said.</p>
      <p>According to a report by Premium Times, Abuh was burnt to death by political thugs in the state on Monday.</p>
      <p>Spokesperson for the command, William Aya, said the politician was sleeping in her home when political thugs set the building ablaze.</p>
      <p>The politician’s remains, which were burnt beyond recognition, had been taken to a mortuary for autopsy.</p>
      <p>Aya said, “It was a very unfortunate incident and the commissioner has ordered a thorough investigation to ensure that all those involved do not escape justice.”</p>
      <p>Since the news of Abuh’s death, supporters of the PDP have accused the All Progressives Congress of being behind her death.</p>
      <p>According to Aya, her killing was a reprisal attack for the death of an APC supporter in the community.</p>
      <p>He added, “There was a misunderstanding between Gowon Simeon and Awolu Zakari, both members of the community.</p>
      <p>“Mr Simeon stabbed Mr Zakari in the chest and he bled to death almost instantly.</p>
      <p>“After Zakari was confirmed dead by a medical doctor, his associates gathered for a reprisal attack against Simeon.</p>
      <p>“They arrived at his uncle’s house where they believed he was hiding and set it on fire.</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately Abuh was sleeping inside the house and was burnt alive.” </p>
