      <h3>Finding Cracks</h3>
      <p>Simulation theory, the hypothesis that we’re just avatars in <a href="https://futurism.com/famous-hacker-living-simulation-escape">a simulated universe</a>, has a new advocate.</p>
      <p>Speaking at a film festival, University of North Carolina at Wilmington computer scientist Curry Guinn suggested that our world isn’t real, <a href="https://www.wraltechwire.com/2019/11/17/are-we-living-in-a-computer-simulation-a-real-matrix-without-knowing-it/">according to <i>WRAL TechWire</i></a>. Though Guinn admitted that it was a fairly speculative idea, he went on to argue that reports of ghosts, déjà vu, and weird coincidences could actually be glitches — and evidence that we’re all trapped in some <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/mit-simulation-hypothesis-players-npcs">futuristic society’s video game</a> or science experiment.</p>
      <h3>Time Loop</h3>
      <p>Guinn pointed out <a href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/elon-musk-reality-simulation-plot-terrible">Elon Musk’s belief</a> in simulation theory to lend more authority to the idea, and he also suggested we could build our own simulations in the future, <i>TechWire</i> reports. And he suspects that video game developers will lead the way.</p>
      <p>“It is inevitable that we will create realities indistinguishable from this reality,” Guinn told the crowd.</p>
      <h3>Occasional Bugs</h3>
      <p>To figure out whether or not we’re in a simulation, Guinn suggests looking for bugs.</p>
      <p>“Glitches in the system. Deja Vu, such as in the Matrix movie when a character sees a cat crossing a doorway repeatedly, may be one glitch,” Guinn said. “Ghosts, ESP, coincidences may be others. The laws of physics in our universe seem peculiarly designed with a set of constants that make carbon-based life possible. Where are the edges?”</p>
