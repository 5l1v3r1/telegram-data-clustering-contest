      <p>The National Chairman of a Pro-NPP group, NPP Grassroot Campaigners, Mr. Emmanuel Nana Apor has lambasted appointees of President Akufo-Addo describing them as stingy.</p>
      <p>According to him, most of the MMDCEs, Ministers and CEO’s of public institutions are so ungenerous to even party footsoldiers who worked tirelessly prior to the 2016 elections to support the party to win power.</p>
      <p>Mr. Apor made the comment at the launch of the group at Kasoa in the Central Region.</p>
      <p>He said some of these Ministers and other appointees never hit the ground to campaign ahead of the 2016 elections, but now enjoying the trappings of power while the footsoldiers struggle to make ends meet.</p>
      <p>“As for house to house campaign, it’s our work as grassroots people, we are the people who do the grounds work. Those ministers none of them went to the villages to campaign, they were never slapped before like some of us were. But we who toiled for them to come to power they are not minding us. If you write a letter to an MP he’ll say I have nothing. But he is paid every month, the Minister is awarding contracts but when it is time to help the grassroots people then they will be complaining. We are the same people you’ll come to in 2020 asking us to go and do campaign.”</p>
      <p>Mr Apor, however, added that the group will not stop doing the house to house campaign for the NPP to ensure the party retains power in 2020.</p>
