      <p>Announced in a post to Apple's developer <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/">website</a>, Apple Developer takes the place of the company's longstanding <a href="https://appleinsider.com/topic/wwdc">WWDC</a> app, which typically sees an update once a year. <br/><br/>With the new app comes a host of fresh features including access to Apple's developer news feed and videos designed to introduce new technologies and assist in app development. Apple says content will be updated "all year round," meaning <i>Apple Developer</i> will be the new home of all things development on iOS. <br/><br/>The app will also serve its original role as a guide to the Worldwide Developers Conference when the gathering takes place in June. <br/><br/>Previously, developer content was spread across the WWDC app, Apple's developer webpage and other online repositories. <br/><br/>In addition, developers can use the app to enroll in the Apple Developer Program on iPhone or iPad. Initially available to U.S. users, enrollment through <i>Apple Developer</i> is conveniently billed as an auto-renewable in-app subscription, simplifying the account management process. Apple plans to roll out the feature to additional locales in the future. <br/><br/>The app itself gets a minor facelift with a new Discover tab, enhanced search user interface, Dark Mode support and Korean language support. A number of unspecified bugs were squashed in the latest release. <br/><br/><i>Apple Developer</i> is a <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id640199958?mt=8">free download</a> from the iOS App Store.</p>
