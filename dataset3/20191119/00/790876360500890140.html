        <p>Spreading kindness is beneficial both to you and to the recipients of your kindness. Recent studies are pointing to something that has been intuitively known for generations: Giving and receiving kindness helps promote good health and general well-being.<sup><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Spread-Kindness#_note-1">[1]</a></sup> You can infuse your community with kindness by being friendly and generous over the holidays and every day throughout the year. Your kindness produces a “ripple effect" which can and often does branch into an entire network of positivity.</p>
        <p>Although donating money or giving things like food and clothing to those in need can be seen as being kind, connecting person-to-person with kindness often has more impact on you, the giver, and them, the receivers. Being kind doesn't have to cost a penny – you just give of yourself, perhaps offering to babysit or pet sit, by giving compliments, or simply by being well-mannered and considerate. Adopt the "kindness ethic" and you will find that your kindness is contagious, lifting you and those who your kindness touches.</p>

            <p><b>1. Smile.</b> Look people in the eyes when you give them a grin. This is such a simple way to spread kindness, and it’s free! Be generous with your smile and put feeling into it. Smile at store clerks, waiters and baristas, mail carriers, and other people you come in contact with. This easy gesture can brighten people’s day.</p>

Aim to be cooperative and thoughtful.<sup><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Spread-Kindness#_note-3">[3]</a></sup></p>

                        <p><b>3. Encourage children.</b> One of the best ways to spread kindness is by starting at home. If you have children, instill in them the importance of being kind to all beings. Read and tell them stories about kindness. Teach them forgiveness and gratitude as well as respect for all others, regardless of race, gender, origin, culture or socio-economic status.<sup><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Spread-Kindness#_note-5">[5]</a></sup></p>

Sometimes advice isn’t needed, and others just want to be heard. In order to develop better compassion for others, you should practice self-compassion as well by soothing yourself when you need it. When someone lets you down, remind yourself that people struggle silently for many reasons. Don’t be quick to anger or hold a grudge.<sup><a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Spread-Kindness#_note-7">[7]</a></sup></p>

                                  <li>For example, you can practice self-compassion by breathing deeply and releasing the tension in your muscles. Hold your hand over your heart. Focus on your breathing and imagine that you’re using it to send warm compassion throughout your body. Think of a positive self-affirmation, such as “Kindness is a strength. You are kind and capable.”</li>

This tip circulates online as an “act of kindness” but is not advisable, as it can have the opposite effect. Even though your intentions are good, you can end up causing unintentional upset. Some weeds are beneficial and grown intentionally. As far as pruning, certain plants do better with their blooms and seed heads intact rather than pinched back (or the grower may simply prefer them the way they are).</p>
