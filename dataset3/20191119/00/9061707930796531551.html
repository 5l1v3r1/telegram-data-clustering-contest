      <h1>Harry Potter illustrator visits Derby High School</h1>
      <h2>Jim Kay is bringing the JK Rowling books to life</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Jane McFarlane</a></address>
      <p>Derbyshire-born illustrator <a href="https://creepyscrawlers.com/">Jim Kay</a> told a packed audience at <a href="https://www.derbyhigh.derby.sch.uk/">Derby High School</a> how he revisited the county to help him bring the Harry Potter books to life.</p>
      <p>Mr Kay was selected by author JK Rowling to illustrate the world-famous book series and so far he has completed four titles with three to go.</p>
      <p>The latest in the series, the Goblet of Fire, has just been published by Bloomsbury Books.</p>
      <p>Pupils and their families, along with staff and children from other schools in Derby, were treated to a fascinating talk and some top illustrating tips.</p>
      <p><a href="https://creepyscrawlers.com/">Mr Kay</a> said he was born in Derbyshire and he had revisited the county to gain some inspiration for his illustrations.</p>
      <p>He said he was fascinated by artist Joseph Wright and that he took photos of the riding stables at Calke Abbey and used them as inspiration for Hagrid’s hut.</p>
      <p>He said: “I just loved the colours in the stables and I used them for an illustration I did of Buckbeak on a bed in Hagrid’s hut. If you struggle with colour then just take a note of colours you see that work together.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://creepyscrawlers.com/">Mr Kay</a> told the audience how he created models to enable him to create his illustrations and he said the hardest character to draw was Harry and the easiest was Hagrid.</p>
      <p>“Children are very difficult to draw; if you add a line you can age them by years. What I would say is don’t worry about the craft of drawing and don’t think you can’t be an artist if you can’t draw. If you do it a lot you will get better at it. It’s about coming up with great ideas. Embrace mistakes. I go wrong all the time and sometimes you get happy accidents with mistakes.”</p>
      <p>Sue Bussey, Library Resources Manager at <a href="https://www.derbyhigh.derby.sch.uk/">Derby High School,</a> organised the visit.</p>
      <p>She said: “It was lovely to see so many of our students their families and many other guests joining together for this ‘treat’ of a night. <a href="https://creepyscrawlers.com/">Jim Kay</a> gave a very entertaining talk about how he creates his pictures. The excitement and sheer joy of the young people, many of whom had dressed in their robes for the occasion, made the school and the library buzz. Anybody questioning the need for libraries in schools need only to look to events like this. Many thanks to <a href="https://creepyscrawlers.com/">Jim Kay</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/">Bloomsbury publishing</a> and <a href="https://authorsalouduk.co.uk/">Authors Aloud</a> for making this happen.”</p>
