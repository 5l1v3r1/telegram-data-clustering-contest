      <h1>Ola partners with Microsoft Research to study air quality in Delhi-NCR</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Sanchita Nambiar</a></address>
      <p>In a bid to contribute towards Indian government’s initiative to combat air pollution, Ola has partnered with Microsoft Research to measure street-level air quality data in the Delhi-NCR region.</p>
      <p>As a part of this programme, Ola will mount sensors on vehicles to gather particulate matter (PM 2.5) data. Cars have been identified based on complex algorithms to ensure maximum geographical coverage of data. The sensors to be mounted in the engine compartment, have been custom made by a Delhi-based company, Purelogic Labs India</p>
      <p>The project will be rolled out this month and is expected to collect data points over the course of one year to analyse variation in Delhi’s air pollution. The data gathered through this, combined with traffic and speed data, can prove instrumental in identifying bad air-quality hotspots in the city.</p>
      <p>Expressing views on this, Anand Shah, head, Ola Mobility Institute, said, “This project is part of Ola City Sense, a programme to provide intelligent data-based insights to cities. We are confident that the data acquired from this study will add a new dimension of knowledge to what is already known about air pollution and help combat the problem better through hyper-local strategies.”</p>
