      <h1>Michael Jackson lawsuits to 'reopen after two boys accuse star of molestation'</h1>
      <h2>Wade Robson and James Safechuck accused the music legend of sexually assaulting them when they were children - but their case was originally dismissed in 2017</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:35:29+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 00:35</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Elliott, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/sam-elliott/</a></address>
      <p>A California appeals court appears likely to re-open lawsuits filed by Wade Robson and James Safechuck against music superstar <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/michael-jackson">Michael Jackson</a>.</p>
      <p>The two men have accused the music legend of molesting them when they were boys - however their legal claims were dismissed in 2017.</p>
      <p>In a tentative ruling, the 2nd District Court of Appeal said lawsuits should be 'reconsidered by the trial court'.</p>
      <p>The decision is based on a new California law that gives sex abuse victims far longer to sue.</p>
      <p>They both filed suit against the singer's estate in California seeking millions in damages but the lawsuits were thrown out, partly due to the state's statue of limitations.</p>

      <p>America's statue of limitations varies across the country, but it means there's a deadline in which civil or criminal charges need to be filed when relating to sex abuse claims.</p>
      <p>Robson and Safechuck hit the headlines earlier this year with the release of blockbuster shock doc Leaving Neverland.</p>
      <p>In the film, they both alleged Jackson had abused them from the ages of 10 and seven respectively, after they were befriended by the King of Pop.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>The Jackson family have hit back at the allegations and compared the hounding of Michael to a "public lynching", especially as the late singer is unable to defend himself in person.</p>
      <p>The superstar, who was previously tried on child molestation charges and acquitted on every count, died in 2009 at the aged of 50.</p>
      <p>Biographer Mike Smallcombe accused Safechuck of lying in Dan Reed's documentary, namely about claiming he had refused to testify for Jackson in his 2005 trial.</p>
      <p>Smallcombe told Mirror Online said there were a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/james-safechuck-accused-repeatedly-lying-14170866">number of inaccuracies</a> in the alleged victim's story.</p>

      <p>“In the documentary, Safechuck claims Jackson called him ‘near the end of the trial’ and asked him to testify on his behalf again, as he had done in 1993,” Smallcombe said.</p>
      <p>“Safechuck said he refused, and that Jackson then ‘got really angry’ and threatened him. He repeated this claim under oath, in his ongoing lawsuit against the Jackson Estate.</p>
      <p>“However, it simply can’t be true. Very early on in the trial, the judge ruled that he would allow the jury to hear about five boys whom the prosecution claimed were sexually abused by Jackson."</p>
