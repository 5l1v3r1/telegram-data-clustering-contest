      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami-dolphins/">Miami Dolphins</a> have released troubled running back <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mark-walton/">Mark Walton</a>, saying he had been involved in an unspecified police matter.</p>
      <anchor name="pagebreak">
        <p>Tuesday’s announcement came as the second-year player served a four-game suspension for violating NFL conduct and substance abuse policies.</p>
        <p>The suspension stemmed from <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mark-walton/">Walton</a> being arrested three times last offseason in his hometown of Miami. He was sentenced in August to six months’ probation after pleading no contest to a misdemeanor weapons charge.</p>
        <p>Other charges, including marijuana possession and reckless driving, were dismissed.</p>
        <p>Neither the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami-dolphins/">Dolphins</a> nor <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mark-walton/">Walton</a>’s representatives, First Round Management, immediately returned calls seeking comment.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/mark-walton/">Walton</a> was selected by the Cincinnati Bengals in the fourth round of the 2017 draft after leaving the University of Miami. The Bengals waived him in April after his arrests. The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/miami-dolphins/">Dolphins</a> signed him in May.</p>
