      <h1>Mexico 2-1 Bermuda: Last-gasp winner spares El Tri blushes</h1>

      <p>Uriel Antuna's 93rd-minute winner secured a dramatic 2-1 victory for Mexico against Bermuda in their final CONCACAF Nations League group game.</p>
      <p>Tuesday's clash had been petering out for a draw after Sebastian Cordova's stunning solo goal cancelled out Dante Leverock's shock opener in Toluca.</p>
      <p>However, Antuna spared Mexico's blushes deep into stoppage time as El Tri made it four wins from four matches in Group B in League A.</p>
      <p>Already assured of a semi-final spot, Mexico handed a debut to Luis Romo, while there were seven players in the starting XI with under 10 caps.</p>
      <p>There was an early chance for Mexico, but the home side were made to pay for a lacklustre start against Bermuda.</p>
      <p>After Hugo Gonzalez almost handed Bermuda the lead following a poor pass – Hector Moreno's desperate defending rescuing Mexico – the visitors broke the deadlock from the resulting corner.</p>
      <p>Bermuda captain Leverock gave the minnows a shock lead in the 10th minute when he sprinted into the six-yard box and rose highest to bundle the ball over.</p>
      <p>Cordova almost equalised three minutes later, however, his free-kick was pushed away by the diving Dale Eve, who was less than convincing in dealing with Jose Macias' long-range effort in the 24th minute.</p>
      <p>Mexico eventually equalised approaching the half-hour mark, a moment of individual brilliance from Cordova restoring parity after the 22-year-old received the ball on the edge of the area, dummied and switched feet before firing a shot across goal and past Eve for his first international goal.</p>
      <p>Some neat play almost saw Macias put Mexico ahead in the 38th minute but his side-footed effort looped just over the crossbar.</p>
      <p>Bermuda threatened to restore their lead, but some more last-ditch defending prevented Mexico from falling behind again just past the hour-mark.</p>
      <p>A diving Eve, meanwhile, was relieved to see Antuna's header fly past the post minutes later.</p>
      <p>Gerardo Martino turned to Raul Jimenez for a goal and the Wolves star nearly delivered – his chested attempt from close-range saved by Eve with 14 minutes remaining – but Antuna stepped up at the death to secure all three points.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>
        <b>What does it mean? Improvement needed</b>
      </p>
      <p>Martino made changes for this fixture, handing chances to a host of players with their semi-final passage already sealed. While Mexico preserved their 100 per cent record, it was a sluggish display.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Cordova a shining light for Mexico</b>
      </p>
      <p>On a night Mexico failed to impress, Cordova further highlighted his growing quality. A maiden international goal capped a memorable outing for the America midfielder, who has been linked to Manchester United, Sevilla and Benfica.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Bermuda prove frustrating</b>
      </p>
      <p>Not much was expected of Bermuda, who were routed by Mexico 5-1 in the reverse fixture. But Bermuda deserve credit for their display away from home. Ranked 168th in the world, Bermuda were disciplined and threatening on the break.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What's next?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Mexico's international commitments have concluded for the year, with El Tri looking ahead to the 2020 Nations League semis. Bermuda will be hoping to bounce back next year.</p>
