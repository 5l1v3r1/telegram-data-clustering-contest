        <b>ANALYSIS/OPINION:</b>
      </p>
      <p>If you can’t find anything wrong, simply make something up and put it on national TV nonstop. That’s what passes for principle with Washington Democrats, anyway, and those who have never read the Ten Commandments, as they seek revenge on our startlingly successful president.</p>
      <p>What kind of fools do they take us for? Do they really think it a good thing to keep us in constant turmoil, a la socialist dictators, rather than to do their proper job, namely, keeping America great?</p>
      <p>President Obama paid a foreign hostile government, Iran, half a trilliion dollars of public money in cash. Was this bribery, appeasement or something even more sinister? Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee gave Russia access to 10 percent of America’s uranium, and hired a foreign agent, Christopher Steele, to invent damaging stories about their political rival.</p>
      <p>No problem.</p>
      <p>President Trump, on the other hand, is the most dedicated and effective president we’ve had in centuries. He asks Ukraine to clean up its corruption, which should be a prerequisite to foreign aid, before more millions of our money is wasted — and he becomes a candidate for crucifixion. We must figure this out.</p>
