      <p>OxygenOS 10.0.2 brings October 2019 security patch and bugfixes for the OnePlus 7 and 7 Pro<br/>5 (100%) 2 votes</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/OnePlus">OnePlus</a> was one of the companies that showed great effort to keep their devices running the latest Android release. Therefore, the Chinese firm brought Android 10 in the form of OxygenOS 10 to the OnePlus 7 and 7 Pro few days after Google’s release. The company is giving a step beyond by giving the same treatment to older smartphones. For instance, the OnePlus 6 and 6T are also running Android 10 betas. Moreover, OnePlus 5 and 5T should receive it by next year.</p>
      <p>Last month, OnePlus rolled an incremental update for the OnePlus 7/7T in the form of OxygenOS 10.0.1 it was a minor update. Now, the company is bringing OxygenOS 10.0.2 which brings many improvements and bumps the security patch to October 2019. Interestingly enough, the update is rolling simultaneously for the OnePlus 7 and 7 Pro. <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/oneplus-7-pro-oxygenos-10-0-2-update/">Reports</a> are coming from international markets where both these devices are being contemplated with the update. You can check the full changelog below:</p>

        <li>Optimized the performance of Super Stable feature in the Video for the camera app</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Worth noting that the OnePlus 7 doesn’t have the Super Stable video mode. For that reason, the OxygenOS 10.0.02 changelog omits that part. Apart from this difference, the changelog is the same for both versions. Interestingly enough, the update will reach users in a gradual manner. However, you can alternatively use the Oxygen Updater app to get the latest incremental download links. After downloading the incremental or full OTA zip file, you can sideload the update via Settings &gt; System &gt; System update &gt; Local upgrade. Most importantly, we recommend you to make a backup of your data before proceeding with a manual installation.</p>
