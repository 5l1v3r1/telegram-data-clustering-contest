      <h1>Brit backpacker Grace Millane 'went on BDSM sites and liked to be choked during sex'</h1>
      <h2>Grace Millane used the BDSM dating websites like Whiplr and was on it an hour before she met her alleged killer. She practised choking with her ex-partner it has been revealed at her trial in Auckland, New Zealand</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:58:38+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 00:58</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Dresch, Stephen D'Antal, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matthew-dresch/</a></address>
      <p>British backpacker Grace Millane was on a BDSM website just an hour before she met up with her alleged killer.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old was a member on the fetish dating sites FetLife and Whiplr and used to enjoy being choked by her ex-boyfriend, a court heard.</p>
      <p>The traveller's former partner told police that he and Grace used a safe word, such as 'turtle', while practising BDSM.</p>
      <p>They also agreed a way for her to tap out if she wanted the rough sex to stop, which he said she did 'maybe one in four times'.</p>
      <p>A 27-year-old man is currently on trial for murdering the Brit, although he claims she asked him to choke her and she died by accident.</p>

      <p>Grace, according to data retrieved from Whiplr, had been active on the site just an hour before meeting the defendant outside the SkyCity casino in central Auckland, New Zealand, last December.</p>
      <p>In his statement read today, her former partner said he and Grace had researched how to practice choking safely.</p>
      <p>“When we researched it we knew the word was asphyxiation,” he told police. “Grace and I discussed keeping hands wide and on the side of the neck, never on the front.</p>

      <p>“Grace and I would have a safe word most of the time which we had discussed, something like 'turtle' or something ridiculous. Grace and I used a tapping practice too. If Grace tapped me three times then it would stop.</p>
      <p>"Grace would tap out maybe one in four times.</p>
      <p>“Grace would be sure to do this and I trusted that anytime it was too much for Grace she would do this. Grace and I were careful to discuss not only the physical but the psychological aspects to practicing BDSM.”</p>
      <p>The jury was also read a statement from one of Grace’s friends, who said the 21-year-old “enjoyed her partner to put his hands around her neck”.</p>

      <p>“I can’t really remember the exact words used but it was something like that, said in a jokey way as we talked about sex with our partners,” she told New Zealand police.</p>
      <p>"Grace referred to enjoying a bit of rough sex sometimes when you’re having one of those nights when you’re really, really attracted to one another or when you were particularly turned on.</p>
      <p>"I had the impression that it was normally regular sex but maybe rougher when she was more turned on.”</p>
      <p>But opening the defence case, barrister Ron Mansfield told the jury: “All the evidence shows that Miss Millane was a loving, bright, intelligent young woman and she was.</p>

      <p>“That is her reputation and that should be her reputation and her memory at the start of this trial and at the conclusion if it.</p>
      <p>"The fact that we need to discuss with you what she liked to do in the bedroom should have no impact on her reputation at all.”</p>
      <p>But, he said: “It’s important that we are fully informed. It’s not the time for embarrassment or immaturity.</p>
      <p>“If this couple engaged in consensual sexual activity which included pressure being applied to her neck with her consent and that went wrong, that is not murder.</p>
      <p>“Death through this mechanism may thankfully be rare but it does happen and sadly it happened here.”</p>
      <p>Mr Mansfield said the defendant admits Grace died from pressure he placed on her neck but said expert evidence was consistent with his account that it was consensual, not violent.</p>

      <p>In a police interview, the trial heard last week, he said he only realised Grace was dead when he found her lying on the floor but admits then cramming her body into a suitcase which he buried in a shallow grave in the woods.</p>
      <p>Mr Mansfield said his failure to call for help, disposal of Grace’s body and lies to police were due to panic.</p>
      <p>“He may have thought he wouldn’t be believed,” Mr Mansfield told the jury.  “But don’t prove him right.”</p>
      <p>The trial continues.</p>
