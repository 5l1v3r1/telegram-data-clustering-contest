      <h1>Taste Test: The Best Vegan Chocolate Advent Calendars</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Sadhbh O'Sullivan</a></address>
      <p>In my opinion, advent calendars are as integral to that ~Christmas feeling~ as fir trees and mulled wine. I've loved them ever since I was a kid and had to split a single chocolate one (bought from our local parish, natch) with my two brothers, meaning I got my chocolate mouthful only once every three days. But becoming too old to have my mum buy my advent calendar coincided with me no longer being able to comfortably digest dairy. An advent calendar all to myself was just within my grasp, before it slipped away. It was, to put it mildly, a fucking travesty.</p>
      <p>That was 2013 and now the vegan chocolate market is positively booming. Where there was one expensive, paltry option, there are now dozens of vegan advent calendars to choose from. To work out which ones are worth the cash, we assembled a crack team of tasters (one current vegan, one former vegan, someone who's trying her hand at a plant-based diet, a chocolate sceptic and someone with no strong opinions either way) to survey as many vegan advent calendars as we could find. From £2.49 to £24.99, naturally vegan dark chocolate to rice milk alternatives, all tastes and budgets are catered for. God bless us, every one!</p>

      <p><b>BEST FOR: THOSE WITH A LOVE OF CHOCOLATE AND LOTS OF SPACE</b><br/><br/><b>Sadhbh (current vegan):</b> At first I enjoyed the cube because it's so big and unusual but that is also its flaw to be honest. The individually wrapped discs are delicious – there are choc discs and sea salt and caramel discs but I way prefer the plain ones. They smell really good, and have a balance between that cheap chocolate flavour of advent calendars of yore and Proper Good Chocolate. I don't like the caramel one as much, it is good fake milk chocolate though. I would go back for more.<br/><br/><b>Nina</b> <b>(former vegan):</b> First things first, WHY is this not Christmas-shaped chocolate? It's just not festive, <i>especially</i> having the 25 just be a chocolate bar. Good choccy though – tastes hazelnutty and the texture is decent. I much prefer the caramel one, the salty tang is perfect for a festive mood. A tenner for a calendar is steep but vegan chocolate is often quite expensive. However, I personally can't forgive that they have just transposed their normal product into a festive box.<br/><br/><b>Jess</b> <b>(chocolate sceptic):</b> Not a big fan of the individual wrapping, that is NOT eco-friendly. But not going to lie, this chocolate is good. Like, right good. Chocolate bar is a disaster though – imagine that on Christmas morning, Christmas would be ruined. I think the chocolate bar at the end makes it feel like a marketing stunt just to get you to buy their chocolates for the rest of the year.<br/><br/><b>Elli</b> <b>(neutral bystander):</b> A no from me. <br/><br/><b>Paulina</b> <b>(vegan curious):</b> It reminds me a bit of 30p Asda Smart Price chocolate so would be disappointed for the £10 price tag, but I'm also new to the vegan chocolate world.</p>

      <p><b>BEST FOR: FANS OF FESTIVE FUN</b><br/><br/><b>Nina: </b>This packaging is almost Liberty-esque. For the same price as the Nomo one, I like the look of it more. But I've got to be honest, the chocolate isn't as good. I'm very excited there are festive shapes though. I think I would actually accept a chocolate I don't like as much for the festive vibe. But they're chunky monkeys. Very, very thick.<br/><br/><b>Jess:</b> This has a great design – hangable, which means it's small-London-flat-friendly. But this is wayyyy too much sugar for me. They've covered up the lack of milk with sugar, which is a classic free-from problem.<br/><br/><b>Paulina: </b>I actually prefer this one. It's evident they have thought through their Christmas design – Christmas choc shapes and gold packaging, very festive. More chocolate on offer too, and I am greedy.<br/><br/><b>Sadhbh: </b>Yessss I love solid Christmas paraphernalia. Nothing says holidays are coming like biting off a snowman's head. It's hard to open the doors too, which is very festive in my opinion. Also, the shapes aren't moulded into the plastic backing but made separately and then packaged, which gives them more weight. Sadly, I don't find it as nice as the Nomo, it tastes more sugary. It doesn't really taste like chocolate but I like the bite on it.</p>

      <p><b>BEST FOR: THOSE WHO WANT TO IMAGINE WHAT CHOCOLATE TASTED LIKE IN THE TUDOR TIMES<br/></b><br/><i>Ed note: This proved to be a controversial calendar, though another colleague who regularly eats 90% chocolate did come in and say she loves it. Clearly an acquired taste.<br/></i><br/><b>Sadhbh: </b>This is very slick, it's clearly designed for adults, not kids. We had our first foil here and the chocolates being poured into the plastic moulds, which feels very traditional to me. That said, eating it was a challenge. You know who would probably love this? Queen Elizabeth I.<br/><br/><b>Jess:</b> It tastes like soil. Who would eat this every morning and think, <i>Mmmm, Christmas. What a treat!</i> And it has a really weighty aftertaste that lingers. <br/><br/><b>Nina:</b> This is absolutely terrible. I'd rather eat coal, or leather – this is making a mockery of advent calendars. I like dark chocolate but this is too much. It's the chocolate equivalent of people who order a five spice vindaloo just to prove they're hard.<br/><br/><b>Elli: </b>It just tastes like the ground, I'm sorry. Gwyneth Paltrow would pretend to like this.<br/><br/><b>Paulina:</b> It doesn't surprise me necessarily because they put 'no added sugar' on the front but THAT NEEDS TO BE A WARNING. It tastes how I imagine a spoonful of pure cocoa would taste. Not suitable for everyday people.</p>

      <p><b>BEST FOR: VEGANS WHO MISS CHOCOLATE SELECTION BOXES</b><br/><br/><b>Nina: </b>Eurgh there's marzipan behind the first door I opened. No, NO. I'm having a strawberry one instead and the taste is DELICIOUS. It reminds me of back when I could eat all chocolate and felt normal. I think I'd rather have this as a box of chocolates than an advent calendar but this is definitely the one we're collectively the most excited about. You can taste the twenty four pounds and ninety nine pence.<br/><br/><b>Sadhbh:</b> I like the picture on this. Unlike Nina, I like marzipan and this is GOOD – I'm gonna eat the whole thing and try another one. The ginger one is good too. I think how much you like it depends on which one you get. For me this is very fun and I like having the dark chocolate options. It's a yes from me. <br/><br/><b>Jess: </b>I had the cherry one and I do not like it. Vvvvvv sugary. I hate them. There're too many flavours that are shit and when you have no control over what you have each day, there's too much room for error.<br/><br/><b>Paulina:</b> Get on board Jess! This has been my favourite so far and has tasted the most like <i>regular</i> milk chocolate to me. I could be biased though, I had the peanut butter one and peanut butter choc is my favourite of all time.<br/><br/><b>Elli: </b>The cheeky gin truffle is a grower.</p>

      <p><b>BEST FOR: FANCY LADS WHO HATE DARK CHOCOLATE</b><br/><br/><b>Nina: </b>Like the other one from this company, this loses points because you have to destroy its structural integrity to get to the goods. These doors are actually even SMALLER. This has more of the Turkish delight, which I love. However, on my second piece I found either a very hard bit of crystallised sugar or...a piece of plastic. I can't tell.<br/><br/><b>Sadhbh: </b>The dominant flavour of all these, without the dark ones, is sugar. There are still some delicious ones. I'm a fan of Turkish delight too and this is a goodun.<br/><br/><b>Paulina:</b> The chocolate truffle smells like stale chocolate, which is a turn off, and it tastes like icing sugar.</p>

      <p><b>BEST FOR: FANS OF DARK CHOCOLATE</b><br/><br/><b>Paulina:</b> Instantly feel mature when eating this. It won't set you off on a sugar rush for the rest of the day. Very smooth – it's traditional dark chocolate and doesn't need any substitutes.<br/><br/><b>Elli: </b>Yeah this is real good.<br/><br/><b>Nina: </b>This is the GOOD shit. I would eat this every day for 24 days, no question. It's doing its job very well.<br/><br/><b>Sadhbh: </b>The packaging on this is, again, very classy. And the foldout display feels chic. It definitely has the best cocoa flavour, it's really nice. I like that the shape has a variety of thicknesses, which makes eating it fun. Love to bite off a head.<br/><br/><b>Jess: </b>Nope. I hate it. But to be fair I don't really like chocolate.</p>

      <p><b>BEST VALUE FOR MONEY</b><br/><br/><b>Paulina:</b> I really like the design, it's not pretentious. But it is a two-man job to get the chocolates out. Not a huge fan of the rice flour flavour here.<br/><br/><b>Jess: </b>I like the front but it tastes like rice paper.<br/><br/><b>Nina: </b>I'm not sure what the taste...is? Sure, if you've never tasted chocolate before this tastes like chocolate, I guess. Vegan products are often more expensive though, so I'm happy that this isn't locking people out. If you have a kid that can't eat dairy, it's nice that parents don't have to spend a bomb to make them feel involved in advent vibes.<br/><br/><b>Elli: </b>This is not bad cheap choc imo.</p>

      <p><b>BEST FOR A TASTY MILK CHOCOLATE ALTERNATIVE</b><br/><br/><b>Sadhbh: </b>This is a fun design! I really like this, it has the best non-dark chocolate flavour profile so far. It's creamy and interesting. Even though I've now eaten an obscene amount of chocolate I happily finished this square.<br/><br/><b>Elli:</b> This is nice for kids, and kidlike adults!<br/><br/><b>Paulina: </b>This is very close to tasting like milk chocolate.<br/><br/><b>Nina: </b>That is tasty. I'd go as far as saying the tastiest we've had. And it has the best packaging for kids.</p>
