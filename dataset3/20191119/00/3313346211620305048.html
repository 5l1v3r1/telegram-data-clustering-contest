      <p>The team at <i>Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen </i>developer Visionary Realms <a href="https://twitter.com/PantheonMMO/status/1196943965028802561">confirmed today</a> that studio cofounder and MMORPG veteran Brad McQuaid passed away in the night.</p>
      <p>McQuaid had been part of the <i>Pantheon </i>team for years, the latest stop in a successful MMORPG career that encompassed a key design leadership role on the original <i>Everquest </i>and a long stint as the co-founder of Sigil Games Online, where he helped lead development of <i>Vanguard: Saga of Heroes</i>.</p>
      <p>In 2014 he helped found Visionary Realms to work on <i>Pantheon</i>, which he <a href="https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/209126/How_the_creator_of_EverQuest_plans_to_bring_MMOs_into_a_new_era.php">described to Gamasutra</a> at the time as an effort to conjure up the engrossing magic of <i>Everquest </i>for older players with more obligations and less free time.</p>
