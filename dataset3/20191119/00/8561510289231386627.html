      <h1>People Are Selling 3D Virtual Sex Models of Celebs, Exes</h1>

      <h3>Just Ugh</h3>
      <p>People are using advanced modeling technology to create, sell, and have <a href="https://futurism.com/truly-immersive-teledildonics-is-the-future-of-intimacy">virtual </a><a href="https://futurism.com/truly-immersive-teledildonics-is-the-future-of-intimacy">sex</a> with 3D avatars of celebrities or — disturbingly — their ex-partners.</p>
      <p>The porn is made created by 3D-rendering software like Virt-A-Mate and Foto2vam and shared or sold over sites like Reddit and Patreon, <i><a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/j5yzpk/they-cant-stop-us-people-are-having-sex-with-3d-avatars-of-their-exes-and-celebrities">Motherboard </a></i><a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/j5yzpk/they-cant-stop-us-people-are-having-sex-with-3d-avatars-of-their-exes-and-celebrities">reports</a>. A booming marketplace already exists for 3D models of celebrities like Emilia Clarke and Emma Watson, along with individual people’s former partners — raising thorny questions about consent and abuse.</p>
      <h3>Weird Flex</h3>
      <p>The people who have created or bought these 3D virtual sex models have an active online community, according to <i>Motherboard</i>. Many brag on Reddit about how the tech has let them act out sexual fantasies with partners past or imagined.</p>
      <p>It can get very icky.</p>
      <p>“From now on, we need to make sure we ask girlfriends to pose a few different angles with a blank expression and flat lighting for a few photos and then import them into VaM,” one person posted.</p>
      <h3>Real Consequences</h3>
      <p>The people creating and selling avatars told <i>Motherboard</i> that they see it as a harmless way for people to <a href="https://futurism.com/digisexuals-tech-replacing-human-intimacy">act out their desires</a>. But it’s easy to imagine issues surrounding revenge porn shared without the subject’s knowledge or consent, especially as computer graphics continue to improve.</p>
      <p>“Is this something the other person wants? Is it mutually desirable/pleasurable?” National University of Ireland Galway legal expert John Danaher told <i>Motherboard</i>. “I don’t think anyone should be creating representations of this sort without the consent of the real person.”</p>
