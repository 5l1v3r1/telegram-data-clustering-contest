      <h1>Mick McCarthy refusing to give up on Euro 2020 qualification after Denmark draw</h1>
      <h2>A defiant <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mick-mccarthy/"><b>Mick McCarthy</b></a> is refusing to give up on his <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/euro-2020/"><b>Euro 2020</b></a> dream after seeing the <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/republic-of-ireland/"><b>Republic of Ireland</b></a> come up just short in their showdown with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/denmark/"><b>Denmark</b></a>.</h2>

      <p>Monday night’s 1-1 draw at the Aviva Stadium means it is the Danes who progress automatically along with Switzerland, leaving Ireland to battle their way through the play-offs in March.</p>
      <p>McCarthy will not know who his team will face in the semi-finals until Tuesday – Slovakia or Wales seem the most likely opposition – but he is convinced they will give anyone a game if they play like they did in their final Group D fixture.</p>
      <blockquote>If we play the way we are playing and play as well as that against other teams, we can beat them<cite>Mick McCarthy</cite></blockquote>
      <p>He said: “I have three months to prepare for that. We’ll see who we get and I’ll plan for it when we get it.</p>
      <p>“If we play the way we are playing and play as well as that against other teams, we can beat them.”</p>
      <p>McCarthy’s men turned in arguably their best performance of the campaign, but ultimately could not get across the finishing line as Denmark held on in a grandstand finish in Dublin.</p>

      <p>Ireland were building a head of steam when they were caught with a 73rd-minute sucker punch as Martin Braithwaite timed his run to perfection to stab Henrik Dalsgaard’s cross past the helpless Darren Randolph.</p>
      <p>McCarthy, who had sent on striker Callum Robinson for midfielder Conor Hourihane just minutes earlier, said: “We shouldn’t have conceded it.</p>
      <p>“It’s always a kick in the nuts when you concede, even more so when you’ve made a positive substitution and you’re trying to get something out of the game, trying to win the game.”</p>
      <p>However, Matt Doherty’s first senior international goal with five minutes remaining set up a late onslaught during which the home side just could not find the deftness of touch to make the pressure count.</p>

      <p>McCarthy added: “I am immensely proud of the players the way they performed tonight, and even more so when we went 1-0 down.</p>
      <p>“But it was a poor goal to give away. Doc says it was his man, it was on him, but he has gone and scored the equaliser, so I will forgive him slightly.</p>
      <p>“I was giving out to him about the goal and I forgot to congratulate him for the goal he scored, so I will go back in there and do that.</p>
      <p>“I’m very disappointed, but very proud of the lads. They were great.”</p>

      <p>Denmark boss Age Hareide, who famously guided his side to a 5-1 World Cup play-off victory in Dublin two years ago, admitted they were fortunate to get away with a sub-standard performance on their latest visit.</p>
      <p>He said: “We didn’t play well at all. I don’t know what happened. A solid defensive play saw us through the first half. We got in front in the second half and eased off in terms of pressure.</p>
      <p>“At the end after they scored, they put a lot of pressure on us. Ireland played well and if they keep going like that, they will probably come through the Nations League play-offs and qualify.”</p>
