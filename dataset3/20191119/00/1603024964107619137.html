      <h1>Shiv Sena MLAs, leaders to meet on Friday as govt talks drag on</h1>

      <p>Amid cautious approach by the NCP -Congress over government formation in Maharashtra, the Shiv Sena has called a meeting of all its MLAs and senior leaders here on November 22, said a party leader on November 19.</p>
      <p>Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray will address the meeting which is expected to deliberate on the future course of action in the backdrop of the three main non-BJP parties making efforts to form government in Maharashtra, which is currently under President's rule.</p>
      <p>"Uddhav Thackeray will address the meeting of party MLAs and other senior leaders on November 22 in Mumbai, said the Sena leader.</p>

      <p>The meeting will discuss the party's future course of action and will also see interaction with newly-elected Sena MLAs, he said.</p>
      <p>The Sena won 56 seats in the October 21 assembly election, but refused to form government with its pre-poll ally BJP (105 seats) after the latter turned down its demand for rotational chief ministership.</p>
      <p>After the two saffron parties parted ways, the Sena reached out to the Congress-NCP, its political rivals till recently, to explore the possibility of forming an alternative government in the country's richest state.</p>
      <p>However, despite several rounds of talks between leaders of the three parties in Mumbai and Delhi, possibility of a Sena-led government still remains at a nascent stage.</p>
      <p>The Sena has repeatedly said the next chief minister will be from the party.</p>
      <p>NCP president Sharad Pawar held a meeting with Congress chief Sonia Gandhi in Delhi on Monday.</p>
      <p>Pawar later said if the NCP-Congress have to take a view on government formation, they have to first discuss it between themselves.</p>
      <p>The two sides have deputed leaders for holding talks on a possible alliance with the Sena, a party closely associated with Hindutva and anti-Congressism.</p>
      <p>A meeting with the Congress scheduled in Delhi on Tuesday to further discuss the possibility of government formation in Maharashtra was called off due to pre-occupation of Congress leaders with Indira Gandhi's birth anniversary events, NCP leader Nawab Malik said.</p>
      <p>He said Congress leaders requested that the meeting be postponed to Wednesday.</p>
      <p>In the last month's polls, the NCP and the Congress, pre-poll allies, won 54 and 44 seats, respectively in the 288- member assembly where the majority mark is 145.<a href="https://www.moneycontrol.com/promos/pro.php">Get access to India's fastest growing financial subscriptions service Moneycontrol Pro for as little as Rs 599 for first year.
