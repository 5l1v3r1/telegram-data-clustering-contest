      <p>There’s a very good chance you’re reading PCMag on a mobile device. Ten years ago, that might have still been paper. But the balance has shifted – we use our phones and tablets a lot more than we used to. This is because the way we run our personal lives has changed and so has the way we do our work. We have become pretty dependent on apps.</p>
      <p>If you read some of the more shrill commentaries in the popular press, this means the end of civilisation, but for most people apps have enriched our lives. At no point in history could you previously have carried an entire library of books to choose from in your pocket. Nor could you have had as much music, either on your device or in an online library, as well as the means to catch up with the news, converse with friends on social media no matter where you are, play a game to pass the time – you get the idea. Our phones, we’d suggest, have enhanced our lives in both a social and a professional sense.</p>
      <p>Inevitably, malware writers have started to take note. Independent research suggests that in the first half of 2019 attacks on mobile phones had increased by 50 percent compared to the same period in 2018. This has run alongside the increase in mobile banking, since inevitably this has led to richer pickings than were available before. Since smartphones have also replaced laptops – at least to some extent – this means they also store sensitive, personal, and potentially valuable data that threat actors may want to get their hands on.</p>

      <p>Of course, there’s also the fact that smartphones are equipped with tons of sensors, such as cameras, microphones, and even GPS trackers, which can turn a seemingly benign smartphone into a spy, if compromised by attackers. Some of these pieces of malware are advanced in their design, activating only when the phone has been moved. Earlier this year researchers alerted Apple to the probability that their mobile security had suffered gaps for a couple of years.</p>
      <p>It’s perfectly reasonable to trust the manufacturers to keep their devices as secure as possible. This is why Google tightened up its rules on what gets into the Play Store a couple of years ago and it’s why Apple has always had a walled-garden approach, examining every app before it gets onto your phone.</p>
      <p>So the first thing to do is to make sure your software and applications are always up to date. If Apple or Google issue an update it’s often because someone has found a way to get at your personal data or to take over your device, so it’s important to keep it up to date. Most updates, when they are available, offer the option to time them overnight so you won’t suffer any disruption.</p>
      <p>Even the very best efforts at security will eventually be bypassed by someone with the right tools and poor intentions so it makes sense to give your device the boost it needs. This is why Bitdefender has added so much focus on the mobile environment to its Total Security product, which starts by making the whole technology environment safer.</p>
      <p>The elements that are specific to mobile devices include anti-theft and web protection for iOS, including full compatibility with iPads. Android users are also helped, as Bitdefender ensures they are protected by an on-demand and on-install scan of all apps, while a component for the wearables market offers protection to smartwatches plus an autopilot function that catches malware as it happens without slowing your phone down.</p>
      <p>Both operating systems benefit from enhanced privacy through Bitdefender VPN, an “app lock” meaning a thief who gets hold of your phone needs another password to use your apps even if they’re through the phone’s main password. Plus, given that a chain is only as strong as its weakest link, Bitdefender has ramped up its security for children using mobile devices.</p>
      <p>We’re all more device-driven than we were before and we are making our lives easier and more efficient through the use of apps and these mobile devices. The downside is that criminals are wise to this and will constantly either try to get access to your data or use your device as a surveillance tool to later which later leads to some form of extortion. Keeping your phone’s software up to date is an excellent first step, and with Bitdefender you can add professional strength security for a very reasonable consumer price.</p>
