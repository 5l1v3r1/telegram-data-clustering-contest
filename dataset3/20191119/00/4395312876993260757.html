      <p>Do you have so many things swirling around in your mind that you’re not even sure where to begin? Has the cooler weather slowed your motivation so you’re feeling frozen in place?</p>
      <h3>Make a list.</h3>
      <p>Grab your phone, a sticky note, or a pad of paper and jot down a few things to help the spinning settle a bit. One thing I usually do when writing a list is to put a few easy things at the very top that I can accomplish quickly to get the momentum going. Drink a cup of coffee? Check! Brush my teeth? Check. And the ball begins rolling because I just got started with a few almost effortless tasks before I tackled the big stuff. For me personally, I am more successful in following through with the tasks if I write them down on an actual piece of paper with a pen. Do what works for you.</p>
      <h3>Move Your Body.</h3>
      <p>You may be feeling blue because of the upcoming holidays or you may feel overwhelmed by a sudden job loss. <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/in-depth/depression-and-exercise/art-20046495">Science </a>has shown that exercise can ease symptoms of depression and anxiety. You don’t have to suddenly sign up for Crossfit to see the results, and you don’t even have to have a formal exercise program to reap the benefits. A walk around the block can help you gain confidence and cope with what you’re feeling in a healthy way. Bonus points if it’s a sunny day when you go for that stroll because some studies have shown sunlight may have a positive effect on mood by increasing levels of serotonin in the brain. Use caution though. Excessive sun exposure is <a href="https://www.webmd.com/beauty/sun-exposure-skin-cancer#1">noted</a> to have harmful effects, so don’t walk around your block for hours on end without some protective clothing and sunscreen with a good SPF.</p>
      <h3>Talk to Someone.</h3>
      <p>Sometimes you just need to talk to someone about what’s on your mind. Speaking the thoughts out loud can often reduce their power over you and help you come up with a plan of action. If you’re unable to get to the root of why you feel stuck, a friend or loved one may be able to help you or point you in the direction of <a href="https://www.helpguide.org/articles/mental-health/finding-a-therapist-who-can-help-you-heal.htm">someone </a>who can. It may only be for a short season, but it’s important to know there are resources out there to help you get back on track and moving again.</p>
