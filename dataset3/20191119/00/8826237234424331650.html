      <p>BATON ROUGE, La. — Many of Louisiana’s state government websites and email systems are shut down because of what the governor’s office says is an attempted ransomware attack.</p>
      <p>The problem Monday disrupted business operations and online services across state agencies. It happened two days after Louisiana’s election for governor, when the Secretary of State’s website was a vital link for information.</p>
      <p>Gov. John Bel Edwards’ office says some services started returning Monday afternoon. But it could take days to restore all websites and online operations.</p>
      <p>Edwards’ office says the Office of Technology Services identified a “cybersecurity threat” that affected some computer servers. The office took all its servers offline as a precaution.</p>
      <p>The governor says state police and federal agencies are investigating.</p>
      <p>Officials say nearly every state agency was affected in the shutdown.</p>
