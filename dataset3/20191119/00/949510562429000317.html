      <p>WASHINGTON (AP) — The federal Bureau of Prisons has been plagued by systematic failures, from massive staffing shortages to chronic violence.</p>
      <p>But the largest agency in the Justice Department has largely stayed out of the public view.</p>
      <p>The death of billionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein and the revelation that he was able to kill himself while behind bars at one of the most secure jails in America has cast a spotlight on the agency, which has also been besieged by serious misconduct in recent years.</p>
      <p>Staffing shortages at the agency are so severe that guards often work overtime day after day or are forced to work mandatory double shifts.</p>
      <p>Troubling issues at the Bureau of Prisons are likely to take center stage Tuesday as the agency’s new director appears before the Senate Judiciary Committee.</p>
