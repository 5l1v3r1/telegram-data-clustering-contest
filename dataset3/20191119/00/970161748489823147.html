      <p>Elton John used to drink ‘a bottle of whisky a day’ when he struggled with alcoholism.</p>
      <p>The music icon battled an addiction to drugs and alcohol at the height of his career.</p>
      <p>He also suffered from the eating disorder bulimia, where he would binge eat after three days of going without food.</p>
      <p>The singer confessed that he also lost friendships during this troubling time, lashing out at them when they pleaded with him to seek help.</p>
      <p>He eventually checked himself into a rehab facility in Chicago for six weeks which Sir Elton felt was the turning point in his life.</p>
      <p>Speaking in a special interview with Graham Norton for the BBC, he was asked what made him want to get help.</p>
      <p>Elton explained: ‘Not only was I a drug addict I was an alcoholic. I used to drink a bottle of Johnnie Walker Black every day.</p>

      <p>‘I used to smoke joints and I was bulimic. I would go to sleep for three days, I hadn’t eaten, then I would go out and gorge myself and then throw it all up. It was a very lonely existence and I just thought, “am I gonna die or am I gonna live? What do you wanna do?”‘</p>

      <p>He went on: ‘When you use drugs for that amount of time they don’t have the same effect. You just take them for the sake of it. They’re not making you happier they’re making you worse and I just sat there one night and said, “This is ridiculous”.</p>
      <p>‘I couldn’t ask for help. People had told me time and time again that I needed help. All my closest friends. No. I screamed and shouted at them, “how dare you tell me?”. I wouldn’t talk to them for a year or so.</p>

      <p>‘Then at the end of the day I’d had enough and I asked for help. I went to a place in Chicago which treated all three diseases, alcoholism, drug addiction and bulimia, all at the same time. Stayed there for six weeks, came home to England and had great after care and took a year off. I spent a long time working as hard as I did to being sober as I did to being an addict.’</p>
