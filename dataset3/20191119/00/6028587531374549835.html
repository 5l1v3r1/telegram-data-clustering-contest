      <p>Kazakh flag carrier Air Astana has signed a letter of intent for 30 Boeing 737 MAX planes, valued at $3.6 billion, during the Dubai Airshow. The aircraft will serve the flagship’s new low-cost airline FlyArystan.</p>

      <p>The tentative order comes a day after Turkey’s SunExpress said it would exercise an option for <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/marisagarcia/2019/11/18/sunexpress-order-is-vote-of-confidence-in-boeing-737max/#22db23bc6d8c">10 additional Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft</a>. Combined with a yet-to-be-announced firm order for 10 737 MAX 7s and 10 MAX 10s, which was reported by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-emirates-airshow-boeing/sales-of-grounded-boeing-737-max-gather-pace-at-dubai-airshow-idUSKBN1XT0NG">Reuters</a>, the deals are a vote of confidence for Boeing’s bestselling plane, which has been grounded worldwide since March following the second of two deadly crashes.</p>
      <p>Air Astana serves cities across Kazakhstan, Central Asia, Asia, China, Europe and Russia with a fleet mix of Boeing 757, 767, and Airbus A320 family aircraft. The airline launched FlyArystan in May to serve the growing domestic market and intends to extend international services to Moscow starting in December.</p>
      <p>“It is clear that low cost air travel has a great future in Kazakhstan and Central Asia,” said Peter Foster, President and CEO of Air Astana. “We believe that the MAX will provide a solid platform for the growth of FlyArystan throughout our region, once the aircraft has successfully returned to service.”</p>
      <p>FlyArystan currently operates with a fleet of three A320 aircraft. Air Astana has previously made a <a href="https://airastana.com/global/en-us/About-Us/Overview/Air-Astana-News/air-astana-destined-to-become-one-of-the-largest-airbus-a320neo-family-operators-in-central-asia-and-cis">commitment to</a> the competing A320neo, and took delivery of its <a href="https://www.airbus.com/newsroom/press-releases/en/2019/09/air-astana-takes-delivery-of-its-first-a321lr.html">first A321LR</a>, on lease from Air Lease Corporation, this September.  </p>
      <p>Boeing’s backlog for the 737 MAX had fallen by about 200 planes this year as some airlines have swapped orders for larger planes and the failure of India’s Jet Airways wiped about 125 from the books.</p>
      <p>The embattled U.S. plane maker won a crucial boost in June from International Airlines Group, which which signed a letter of intent to buy <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeremybogaisky/2019/06/18/boeings-troubled-737-max-wins-crucial-endorsement-with-big-potential-order-from-iag/#90be1a5fc26b">200 737 MAX aircraft</a>, but the order has not yet been finalized.</p>
