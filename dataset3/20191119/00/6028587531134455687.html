      <p>Nearly two decades ago, much before the internet’s ascent to power, Bill Gates said, “Content is king.” The prophecy did not only come true, but has progressively manifested itself in various forms over the years. Let's backtrack to the mid-1990s when the internet was called the information superhighway. Everybody was creating dot-com sites. And since the world was threatened by throttles, the most prevalent form of content I saw was text and images. Fast forward to 2019, as internet bandwidths <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/616210/average-internet-connection-speed-in-the-us/">skyrocketed exponentially</a>, and content on digital platforms underwent a drastic facelift with the advent of video.As the CEO of a video opinion intelligence engine, I believe video has emerged as the king of all content forms today. Thanks to high-speed internet, smart devices, and high-definition display resolutions, video has acquired a staple status in our daily lives. A report by Cisco (<a href="http://www.digitaltvnews.net/?p=32281">via DigitalTVNews</a>) suggests that "IP video traffic will quadruple by 2022. As a result, it will make up an even larger percentage of total IP traffic than before — up to 82 percent from 75 percent.<b>"</b> This statistic and ever-burgeoning technological developments suggest that video is a predominant force in our digital age, and the trend will likely remain viable in the coming years.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Video Technology: A Success Story Of 21st Century Businesses</b>
      </p>
      <p>As video technologies rose to fame across the globe, businesses displayed excellent adaptability and brought their content strategies to life with video. In fact, much of content marketing has become synonymous with video marketing. Moreover, trends like AR, VR, visual storytelling and video AI are becoming global commonalities.</p>
      <p>For example, businesses are harnessing AR and VR to provide complete three-dimensional virtual reality and interactive experiences for customers. According to Future Source, <a href="https://www.futuresource-consulting.com/press-release/media-entertainment-press/location-based-vr-to-reach-809-million-as-consumers-embrace-the-social-side-of-the-immersive-tech/">consumer spending</a> on location-based VR tech is expected to reach $809 million by 2022.</p>
      <p>In addition, one study (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/apr/16/got-a-minute-global-attention-span-is-narrowing-study-reveals">via <i>The Guardian</i></a>) suggested that attention spans are shortening globally, perhaps due to the amount of information we're presented with. Brands and businesses have, concurrently, embraced short-form video. Brands are increasingly using short-form videos on social media platforms like Instagram, Snapchat, Tik Tok and so on to concoct viral sensations that drive engagement. A survey from Wyzowl (<a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/state-of-video-marketing-new-data">via Hubspot</a>) found that 87% of businesses were using video as a marketing tool in 2019.</p>
      <p>We have witnessed the boom of the video trend, but the impending question is: What lies ahead?</p>
      <p>
        <b>Unraveling The Foreseeable Future Of Video Technology </b>
      </p>
      <p>I believe video technologies are set up for hyper-growth in the next decade. Considering how video has evolved, here are a few innovations I believe will attract eyeballs and increased investments in the coming years.</p>
      <p><b>Immersive all the way: </b>Companies have already been working to bring immersive experiences to the smallest of screens for the last couple of years. Augmented reality and virtual reality (AR and VR) are far ahead in this game. Microsoft has <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsofts-latest-holoportation-demo-shows-off-its-mixed-reality-ai-translation-technologies/">developed technologies</a> like holoportation that use technology to allow users to see, hear and interact with other participants in different locations in real time. Rapidly advancing AR, VR and mixed reality (MR) could help improve communication by leaps and bounds and make communication from a distance as real as it can get. These growing advancements in immersive video tech are also <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/04/20/full-sail-university-online-class-vr-session/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAB5tuwEtBEOl0OXeG7uapO3ciwILNr-MgnopWpzz22chmSSOSh0-FbeS94sorgqJx3QFmV8g1cZ4GERGfIZMWZJR-93NLpvAofk9QZ8WkMIDqQblePiztJhQpnl6y5R_obdQwcTDTBNN3w6y4NZGnRdjsqMW1beoXloR0qCm1sTb">reinventing education:</a> Some institutions are using VR to make virtual classrooms feel more like traditional ones. I believe the next few years will be crucial for bringing immersive and interactive technologies to life with multiple use cases.</p>
      <p><b>Making sense of the video data deluge: </b>The volume of video data created every day is colossal. Brands and businesses are now exploring video content analysis technologies that can transform massive video datasets into intelligence. BriefCam is making notable progress in transforming raw video surveillance footage into actionable insights. Canon’s crowd people counter is another example of advanced video tech fueling intelligence: It can count more than 80,000 people on video in real time. Soon, businesses may be able to use technologies like these to decode videos with greater precision to further both quantitative and qualitative intelligence.</p>
      <p><b>Taking personalization and relevance to the next level: </b>I believe emerging technologies will also be capable of serving hyper-personalized videos, which could make brand interactions personal to each individual. Already, Microsoft’s video indexer uses advanced AI to extract spoken words, text, visuals and emotions from videos. Technologies for slicing and dicing videos are improving information retrieval by providing specific pieces of information with the highest accuracy. Google is already making considerable progress in this domain through its <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/24/google-will-start-showing-relevant-video-clips-in-search-results.html">video search results</a>. I believe the next decade will be all about perfecting personalized content strategies.</p>
      <p>Nuanced visual computing techniques and intelligent algorithms are primed to redefine communication and business strategies in ways we might have not yet imagined. However, building these autonomous technologies is a humongous task. I believe the biggest roadblock to deciphering videos will be training deep neural networks on large labeled video datasets. The supervised method of training AI models to recognize datasets and retrieve patterns typically requires large swathes of labeled data types. This could massively slow down progress. Secondly, video datasets typically require more storage and computing power when compared to other forms of data. Lastly, making capture technologies mobile, convenient and easily controllable will also be challenging. I also believe businesses and innovators must be wary of the possible increased risk of privacy breaches with the rapid development of video tech. Cruising past these challenges will likely require human interventions, comprehensive regulations and out-of-the-box solutions. I am positive, however, that video technologies will evolve to greater levels of sophistication in the next decade and will hold some surprises.</p>
