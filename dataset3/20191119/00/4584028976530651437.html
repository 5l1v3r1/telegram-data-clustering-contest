      <p>Half-centuries from Devon Thomas and Jahmar Hamilton on Tuesday powered the Leeward Island Hurricanes to a six-wicket win over the Combined Colleges and Campuses at Conaree in the Colonial Insurance Super 50 competition.</p>
      <p>Thomas smashed nine fours and a six on his way to an unbeaten 78 while Hamilton plundered seven fours and three sixes in his unbeaten knock of 77 as the Hurricanes eased to 191 for 4 from just 41 overs in reply to the CCC’s 190 for 9 from their allotment of 50 overs.</p>
      <p>The two featured in an unbroken stand of 157 after Akeem Jordan (2 for 42) and Carlos Brathwaite (2 for 34) had reduced the Hurricanes to 32 for4 in the eighth over of their innings.</p>
      <p>Former West Indies batsman Kieran Powell made 21 but he was the only other of the dismissed batsman to make it into double figures.</p>
      <p>Earlier, the CCC lost wickets regularly to the Hurricanes’ incisive bowling attack. Only Paul Palmer offered any real resistance scoring an even half-century off 89 balls.</p>
      <p>Johnathan Drakes (29), Jervin Benjamin (28) and Jalarnie Searles (28) all got starts but were unable to keep Quinton Boatswain (2 for 18), Powell (2 for 22), and Terance Ward (2 for 35) at bay. Jason Campbell also snared two wickets to help restrict the CCC to a score under 200.</p>
