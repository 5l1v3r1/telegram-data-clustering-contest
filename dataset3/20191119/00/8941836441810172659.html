      <p>HONOLULU (AP) - The number of Chinese visitors to Hawaii is decreasing in a trend that has continued for the past four years.</p>
      <p>Hawaii Public Radio reported Tuesday that Chinese visitors to Hawaii are down 26% through the third quarter of 2019 that closed at the end of September.</p>
      <p>The Hawaii Tourism Authority says Chinese tourist arrivals in the state have declined since 2015.</p>
      <p>China’s Ministry for Culture and Tourism says about 150 million Chinese citizens traveled abroad in 2018.</p>
      <p>Officials say that number has more than tripled over a 10-year period, with Chinese travelers generating $250 billion in annual economic activity worldwide.</p>
