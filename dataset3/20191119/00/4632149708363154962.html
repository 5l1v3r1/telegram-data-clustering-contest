      <p><i>S Suresh Kumar said Kannada must be taught as 1st or 2nd language; over 44 pvt unaided institutes face disaffiliation</i> <br/><br/>State Primary and Secondary Education Minister S Suresh Kumar said that Kendriya Vidyalayas in Karnataka will have to teach Kannada as a first or second language. <br/><br/>In Bengaluru, over 44 private unaided schools are under the threat of losing their affiliation as they have failed to comply with the compulsory Kannada Language Learning Act, 2015. <br/><br/>In its report, the Kannada Development Authority (KDA) singled out the schools over their failure to comply with provisions of the act, which mandates that schools across the state teach Kannada as a first or second language. The minister has instructed the officials concerned to carry out an inspection in such schools and submit a report by November 20. <br/><br/>“If it is proven that the schools are violating the act then the officials concerned will recommend disaffiliation of such institutes,” he said. <br/><br/>A state-level committee headed by the minister will conduct surprise visits at schools to check if the institutes are complying with compulsory implementation of Kannada. <br/><br/>The panel will also look into issues like whether the schools have hired trained Kannada teachers by visiting schools once every three months. <br/><br/><br/>The management of private schools have expressed their displeasure over the compulsory implementation of Kannada. <br/><br/><br/><b><u>Survey of schools from November 20</u></b> <br/><br/><i>The Union Ministry for Human Resource Development will be conducting a survey at 11.71 lakh schools across the country to verify infrastructural facilities available at the government and aided institutions. It will be carried out from November 20 to December 20. <br/><br/>The state government will be holding a similar survey of 55,965 schools.</i></p>
