      <p>Italian supercar maker Ferrari has confirmed there will never be a plug-in hybrid (PHEV) version of its new Roma sports car.Even though the modular underpinnings of the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltaylor/2019/11/14/ferrari-stays-away-from-electrification-for-new-roma-sports-car/#7e5764735e52">Roma</a> were pre-engineered for hybrid power, the new entry Ferrari will stick with pure front-engined, twin-turbo V8 power for its entire seven-to-eight year life cycle.</p>
      <p>There were rumours that the Roma was planned as a new Dino-style junior Ferrari and would come complete with at least 25km of zero-emission electric range, but it never happened and never will.</p>
      <p>The thing is, it could be done easily and quickly because everything beneath the skin is ready to go. But it could not be done cheaply.</p>
      <p>“We are able to electrify the platform, but we are not foreseeing right now to hybridize this model,” Ferrari’s road-car Technical Director, Michael Leiters, insisted.</p>
      <p>“We would never do it on the same model.”</p>
      <p>That itself hints strongly that another model is being planned to deliver the technology off this same modular architecture, which also sits beneath the more expensive Portofino, with its folding metal hardtop roof.</p>
      <p>But don’t expect it this year. Ferrari has exhausted itself launching five cars this year, including two of them into new segments</p>
      <p>“We committed to introduce 15 new models in the five-year plan, and now we’ve done five,” Ferrari Commercial Director Enrico Galliera said. “Something will happen in the future (with hybridization).</p>
      <p>“But it will not happen next year. 2020 for us is a year of consolidation.</p>
      <p>“2020 will not have the same innovation rate, but will be about consolidating the success for the models we have introduced since 2018.”</p>
      <p>Another hidden gem in any PHEV story would be the unprecedented production and development efficiencies of variants of the twin-turbo V8 powering at least six sports cars (the Roma, Portofino, SF90, F8 Tributo, 488 Pista and the proposed hybrid).</p>
      <p>“Could we do a hybrid or plug-in hybrid variant of the Roma?” Ferrari Commercial Director Enrico Galliera asked.</p>
      <p>“Yes, we could, but we won’t.”</p>
      <p>A hybrid Ferrari on the shared Portofino/Roma platform wouldn’t be the first hybrid Ferrari. Not even close.</p>
      <p>Every Ferrari Formula 1 car in the V6 era has been a hybrid, with two electric motors and a turbocharged V6.</p>
      <p>In terms of road cars, its LaFerrari hypercar used electric boosting power for higher performance.</p>
      <p>More recently, the just-shown, 1000 horsepower <a href="https://www.carsales.com.au/editorial/details/plug-in-ferrari-sf90-stradale-shocks-118737/">SF90 Stradale</a> PHEV will combine its twin-turbo V8 with an electric motor in the transmission and one more on each of its axles.</p>
      <p>Critically, it’s also capable of 25km of pure EV, zero-emission driving for city work.</p>
      <p>And yet, its numbers are <i>very</i> Ferrari.</p>
      <p>It punches to 62mph in just 2.5 seconds and from zero to 124mph in a scarcely credible 6.7 seconds thanks to a 736kW combined power figure.</p>
      <p>The electrification of premium and performance cars seems to have worked in a pincer movement from above and below, with hybrid powertrains sneaking into SUVs (the SUV ranges of Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Porsche are filled with PHEVs) and in the hypercars, but there’s a vacuum of the things in the big-profit sports car world so far.</p>
      <p>Honda’s NS-X and BMW’s i8 are the obvious standouts, but there are others.</p>
      <p>Lotus even turned its Evora into a prototype range-extender electric car, with a three-cylinder gasoline motor feeding a battery and with the wheels only driven on electric power, as far back as 2010.</p>
      <p>McLaren has announced that it will electrify its entire range by 2025, turning them all into hybrids, though Lamborghini insists only its Urus SUV will become a PHEV.</p>
