      <h1>This Video Of Two Men Dancing On The Dating Show ‘Flirty Dancing’ Is Ridiculously Cute</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:23:07+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 00:23</time> by <a rel="author">Michelle Rennex</a></address>
      <p>In 2019, we’ve seen our fair share of dating shows.</p>
      <p>There’s <i>The Bachelor, The Bachelorette, Bachelor in Paradise, Love Island, First Dates, The Farmer Wants a Wife, </i>the list goes on. But all of these shows are nothing compared to the UK dating show <i>Flirty Dancing.</i></p>
      <p>In a premise which sounds absolutely horrifying, two strangers must learn a dance separately and perform it together when they first meet. Their blind date has no chatting, no dinner, no awkward cheese platters – literally just dancing.</p>
      <p>While I thought this show would be a total disaster, I had to eat my words after watching a clip of Garry and Ryan. If love at first sight is real, Garry and Ryan should be the poster boys for it.</p>

      <p>Set to a slow rendition of Sigala and Paloma Faith’s ‘Lullaby’, the boys from the second episode of the second season are on a mission to steal hearts. And by hearts, I mean mine.</p>
      <p>The first look they give each other through the big dramatic windows, the glowing eyes, the beaming smiles, it’s all too much. In the description for the episode, Channel 4 <a href="https://www.channel4.com/programmes/flirty-dancing">said that</a> “Garry finds it hard to talk to men he fancies, while Ryan has never had a boyfriend.” Brb, just gonna go DIE.</p>
      <p>I’ll be honest it’s a bit weird when the music stops and they walk away, with Ryan’s heavy breathing and the longing looks. But, I’m still obsessed with the pair who are destined to be together.</p>
      <p>After going viral on Twitter in the past 24 hours, the general consensus is that the boys and their undeniable chemistry are the purest thing in the world.</p>

      <p>While others couldn’t quite grasp the concept of a blind date not referring to people who are literally blind.</p>

      <p>As expected, the US has adapted the show and an American version, hosted by Jenna Dewan from <i>Step Up,</i> is set to air on FOX on December 29.</p>

      <p>But for those only interested and invested in Garry and Ryan’s love story, you’ll be happy to know that they saw each other again. And again. And plan to spend more time together after that.</p>

      <p>In conclusion, if your heart is dead and cold like mine, <i>Flirty Dancing </i>is the cure.</p>
