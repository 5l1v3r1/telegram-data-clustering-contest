      <p>Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan will inaugurate the 50th anniversary celebrations of the Farm Information Bureau (FIB) here on Tuesday. Agriculture Minister V.S. Sunil Kumar will preside over the function which will be held at the Institution of Engineers hall, Vellayambalam, at 5 p.m. Animal Husbandry Minister K. Raju will honour senior FIB officials. R. Hali, the first Principal Information Officer of the FIB, will be felicitated at the function.</p>
      <p>The State Agricultural Information Wing existed in 1957. Back then, the Animal Husbandry Department had a separate unit for disseminating information - the Veterinary Information Unit.</p>
      <p>The two units were merged to form the FIB on January 1, 1969 when M.N. Govindan Nair was the Agriculture Minister. The <i>Kerala Karshakan </i>magazine, which had first hit the stands in 1954, also was brought under the FIB.</p>
