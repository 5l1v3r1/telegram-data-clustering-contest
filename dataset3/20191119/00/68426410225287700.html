      <h1>Tuesday’s Insider Report: Chairman invests $1.4-million in this high-flying stock</h1>

      <p>Featured below are companies that have experienced recent insider trading activity in the public market through their direct and indirect ownerships, including accounts they have control or direction over.</p>
      <p>The list features insider transaction activity; it does not convey total ownership information as an insider may hold numerous accounts.</p>
      <p>Keep in mind, when looking at transaction activities by insiders, purchasing activity may reflect perceived value in a security. Selling activity may or may not be related to a stock’s valuation; perhaps an insider needs to raise money for personal reasons. An insider’s total holdings should be considered because a sale may, in context, be insignificant if this person has a large remaining position in the company. I tend to put great weight on insider transaction activity when I see multiple insiders trading a company’s shares or units.</p>
      <p>Listed below are two stocks that have had recent buying activity reported by insiders.</p>
