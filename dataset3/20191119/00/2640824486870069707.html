      <h1>LOCALARCHITECTURE adds geometric extension to lausanne's new apostolic church</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">sofia lekka angelopoulou</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.designboom.com/tag/localarchitecture/"><b>LOCALARCHITECTURE</b></a><b> has extended <a href="https://www.designboom.com/tag/architecture-in-switzerland/">lausanne</a>’s new apostolic <a href="https://www.designboom.com/tag/church-architecture-and-design/">church</a>, conceiving the new addition in a way that honors and preserves the spatial concepts of the existing building, while at the same time adds a contemporary quality of lightness and openness.</b> the extension, which took place alongside a renovation of the existing structure in order to combine the qualities of the old with a forward-looking vision, saw the old façade replaced by a geometric, exposed concrete construction, lightly colored and textured. expressing a simple and direct materiality, the new façade makes a strong statement of the building’s identity.</p>

      <p>all images by <a href="http://www.gafsou.ch/">matthieu gafsou<br/></a><b><i>‘the extension of lausanne’s new apostolic church was designed to draw out the existing building’s intrinsic qualities,’</i> notes <a href="http://localarchitecture.ch/">LOCALARCHITECTURE</a>.</b> <i>‘we felt is was essential to follow the clear diagonal lines that underpin the organization of its spaces and circulation flows, and which are its defining feature.’ </i>the building’s new form comprises two wings extending from the corners of the church, which enlarge the foyer at ground level towards the new entrance. one of these triangular wings incorporates the existing elevator and meets the tip of the other wing, which houses the new multipurpose hall.</p>

      <p><b>a covered piazza in front of the church is created at the point where the two wings meet, forming a spot in the south-west corner where the new entrance is located.</b> <i>‘the church looks as though borne aloft on wings – wings that are opening, to welcome visitors,’</i> explains the local architecture studio. <i>‘symbolically this new image suggests openness and flight, connecting earth and heaven.’</i></p>

      <p><b>the existing foyer has been expanded at ground level, while the main circulation flow with its corner staircases has been retained in order to preserve the spirit of the existing building.</b> these staircases were restored and fitted with lighter and more transparent balustrades. the spacious new foyer gives a clear view of the various activities taking place and welcomes the community in a dynamic space that is open to the outside world.</p>

      <p><b>the exterior façade was redesigned to meet the new energy efficiency standards now in force, as well as to deliver optimal thermal comfort for the building’s users.</b> the old façade has been replaced with an exposed concrete construction, lightly colored and textured: the building expresses a simple and direct materiality, making a strong statement of identity.</p>
