      <p>One week after T-Mobile <a href="https://www.tmonews.com/2019/11/t-mobile-holiday-black-friday-deals-galaxy-s10-note-10-iphone-apple-watch/">announced its holiday deals</a>, Metro by T-Mobile has unleashed a special offer of its own.</p>
      <p>Metro by T-Mobile’s first Black Friday deal offers two free smartphones and a free tablet, all on a plan that’s $100 per month. Customers who switch to Metro, port in their number, and buy a Samsung Galaxy A20 or LG Stylo 5 can get a $239.99 instant rebate to cover the cost of their new phone. Then when you add another line and purchase another Galaxy A20 or Stylo 5, you can get another $239.99 instant rebate to cover the second phone.</p>
      <p>For the next step of the offer you can buy an Alcatel Joy Tab tablet and activate a new line of service on it. You’ll then get a $110 instant rebate off its price as well as a $50 Visa prepaid gift card to cover the remaining cost. The fine print of the deal states that this prepaid card offer is not valid in CT, RI, or Miami-Dade County, FL.</p>
      <p>Finally, the promotional rate plan associated with this deal gets you unlimited talk, text, and data on the two phones and unlimited LTE data on your tablet, plus an Amazon Prime subscription. Pricing for this rate plan is $100 per month.</p>
      <p>Metro says that this 2 Free Phones + Tablet deal is available starting today in Metro by T-Mobile stores. It’ll be available for a limited time.</p>
      <p>Another deal is coming on November 28th. Starting on that date, new and existing Metro by T-Mobile customers can get a free smartphone when they add a line. The free phone options will include the Samsung Galaxy A10e, LG K40, and Moto G7 Play.</p>
