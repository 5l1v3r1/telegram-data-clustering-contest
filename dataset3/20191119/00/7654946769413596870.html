      <h1>Cop in fatal crash would’ve lost his car under councilman’s safety bill</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:05:12+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 00:05</time> by <a rel="author">Ben Cohn and Jorge Fitz-Gibbon</a></address>
      <p>An NYPD cop who <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/17/nypd-cop-in-fatal-crash-got-at-least-10-traffic-citations-this-year/">racked up 10 speeding tickets</a> and red-light infractions this year before fatally crashing on the FDR is proof that traffic-cam violations should carry stronger penalties, a city councilman said Monday.</p>
      <p>Brooklyn Democrat Brad Lander <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/16/nypd-officer-dead-2-critically-injured-in-deadly-crash-on-fdr-sources/">said the Saturday night wreck</a> that killed Officer Garman Chen and left two others seriously injured is exactly the kind of tragedy his Reckless Driver Accountability Act was <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/06/05/reckless-drivers-could-soon-have-cars-impounded/">designed to address</a> — by booting cars with five or more violations in a one-year period.</p>
      <p>“We’ll never know whether Officer Chen’s life might have been saved because we did not have it in place at the time,” Lander said in a statement to The Post.</p>
      <p>“The bill targets cars which have numerous traffic violations, and would require offenders to go to a driving accountability course and eventually, have their car taken away if they continue to rack up violations. Officer Chen’s car had a large number of speeding violations and red light tickets, which would have made it subject to the bill if it was law.”</p>
      <p>This year alone, Chen’s 2016 Lexus racked up three camera violations for running red lights and seven for speeding in a school zone, including on Halloween.</p>
      <p>Currently, traffic camera violations carry a fine but do not result in points added to the driver’s license.</p>
      <p>Under Lander’s proposal, a car that accumulates a combined five or more tickets for speeding and red-light running in a 12-month period would get booted until the owner takes a Reckless Driver Accountability Program.</p>

      <p>Lander said the proposal introduced last year has support from a majority of council members, but not the mayor — so his office is trying “to resolve some of the legal and logistical questions.”</p>
      <p>City Hall did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
      <p>Chen, 25, was <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/16/shocking-video-shows-moment-car-driven-by-nypd-officer-garman-chen-crashes-on-fdr-drive/">killed in a horrific, caught-on-camera crash</a> near E. 23rd Street at 2:30 a.m. Saturday.</p>
      <p>Two passengers — city firefighter Kenneth Larkin and his girlfriend, Amanda Remy — where thrown from Chen’s black 2016 Lexus and seriously injured.</p>
      <p>Larkin, 25, a first-year firefighter assigned to Ladder Co. 10 in Manhattan, was listed in critical condition at Bellevue Hospital Monday.</p>
      <p>Remy, 25, was in stable condition after undergoing surgery, hospital officials said.</p>
