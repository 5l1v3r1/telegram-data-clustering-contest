      <h2>There could be two huge new chart-toppers this Friday.</h2>

      <p>The midweek numbers are in, and this week could be a big one for both Westlife and Billie Eilish.</p>
      <p>In today's Official Irish Chart Update, Westlife lead the albums Top 50 and are already in-line for 2019's fastest-selling album with Spectrum after a weekend of sales. Should Spectrum continue its momentum, the album will be Westlife's 11th Number 1.</p>
      <p>Spectrum features the Number 2 single Hello My Love and Top 50 hits Better Man, Dynamite and My Blood. All four songs are co-written by Ed Sheeran. </p>
      <p>Celine Dion is on track for a Top 5 debut with her first English language album in six years, Courage, currently at Number 4. 2013's Loved Me Back To Life peaked at Number 3.</p>

      <p>There's also a potential tenth Top 10 album for Nathan Carter; his latest collection Irish Heartland is currently at Number 10.</p>
      <p>On the singles rundown, Billie Eilish could claim her first Number 1 single with Everything I Wanted. The song currently has a narrow lead over last week's chart-topper Don't Start Now by Dua Lipa. Billie has so far peaked at Number 2 twice with hits Bury A Friend and Bad Guy.</p>
      <p>Taylor Swift's Lover is set for a Top 20 return at Number 19 following the release of a new version featuring Shawn Mendes, and finally, Irish rappers Versatile are on course for a third Top 50 hit with Escape Wagon featuring Coolio at Number 20.</p>
      <p>This week's final chart placings will be revealed at 3pm on Friday along with the full Top 50 Official Irish Singles and Albums Charts on OfficialCharts.com/Ireland. Listen to the chart every Friday on RTÉ FM with Bláthnaid Treacy at 8pm.</p>
