      <p>CAIRO - 19 November 2019: The volume of production of the liquefaction plant in Edco exceeded 90 percent of production capacity, according to sources in the petroleum sector. <br/><br/>The volume of production of the liquefaction plant in Edco is expected to reach 100 percent in the coming period, the sources said. <br/><br/>The Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Company (EGAS) revealed in October that the amount of liquefied gas exported from liquefaction plants at Edco amounted to 172.8 billion feet in 2018/2019. <br/><br/>The company's annual report of the fiscal year 2018/2019 said that 45 gas shipments were exported during the last fiscal year. <br/><br/>Exports of natural gas through the Arab gas pipeline resumed during the last fiscal year as of September 2018. According to the report, the import of liquefied gas was stopped as of September 2018, and the gas unit was dispensed. <br/><br/>Egypt currently has two liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities in both Edco and Damietta. With gas production amounting to around 6.4 billion cubic feet per day, Egypt achieved self-sufficiency of gas by the end of September 2018, aiming to become a regional hub of energy. <br/><br/>LNG plant in Edco was launched in 2005 and is the largest project for liquefaction of natural gas in Egypt, where it includes two units for liquefaction of natural gas with a capacity of 4.1 million tons of gas per year for each unit. <br/><br/>Edco Natural Gas Liquefaction Plant is a joint venture between the General Petroleum Corporation (12 percent), the Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Company (EGAS) (12 percent), the British Gas Company (35.5 percent), the Malaysian Petronas Company (35.5 percent) and the French Enge Company Jazz de France previously (5 percent).</p>
