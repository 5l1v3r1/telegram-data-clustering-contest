      <h1>Scientists use Hawaii telescope to spot water vapor on distant moon</h1>

      <p>HONOLULU, Hawaii (HawaiiNewsNow) - NASA scientists using a telescope atop Mauna Kea have confirmed the presence of water vapor on the surface of Europa, one of Jupiter’s 79 moons.</p>
      <p>The find almost certainly means the moon has liquid water, an essential ingredient for life.</p>
      <p>In fact, scientists believe that there’s a liquid water ocean on Europa beneath a miles-thick ice shell that has twice as much water as all of the oceans on Earth.</p>
      <p>Lucas Paganini, a NASA planetary scientist who led the water detection investigation, said two of the three requirements for life ― essential chemical elements and sources of energy ― are found all over the solar systems. "But the third — liquid water — is somewhat hard to find beyond Earth,” he said.</p>
      <p>Finding water vapor on Europa, he said, is the “next best thing” to liquid water.</p>
      <p>The discovery was announced in an article published Monday in the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-019-0933-6">journal Nature Astronomy</a>.</p>
      <p>Paganini and his team reported that they detected 5,200 pounds of water vapor being released from Europa per second. That’s enough to fill an Olympic-size swimming pool within minutes.</p>
      <p>Europa ― located some 390 million miles away ― is slightly smaller than Earth’s Moon.</p>
