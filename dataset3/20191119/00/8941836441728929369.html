      <h1>Official: Safety lacking before Uber self-driving car crash</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T00:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Krisher</a></address>
      <p>The chairman of the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-transportation-safety-board/">National Transportation Safety Board</a> says <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/uber/">Uber</a> had an ineffective safety culture when one of its autonomous test vehicles ran down and killed a pedestrian last year in Tempe, Arizona.</p>
      <p>Robert Sumwalt said at a hearing Tuesday on the March 2018 crash that <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/uber/">Uber</a> didn’t continually monitor its operations and it had de-activated its Volvo SUV’s automatic emergency braking system. <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/uber/">Uber</a>’s own system also didn’t have the ability to brake automatically, relying on a human backup driver to do the braking.</p>
      <p>He says all companies that test autonomous vehicles on public roads need to study the crash to prevent future accidents.</p>
      <p>Sumwalt said lessons from the crash don’t just apply to <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/uber/">Uber</a>’s Advanced Technologies Group “and they’re not limited to ‘something went wrong and now it’s fixed.’ Something went wrong, and something else might go wrong unless it’s prevented,” he said.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/uber/">Uber</a> system detected the pedestrian, Elaine Herzberg, 49, 5.6 seconds before the crash. But it but failed to determine whether she was a bicyclist, pedestrian or unknown object, or that she was headed into the vehicle’s path, the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-transportation-safety-board/">NTSB</a> said. The system also did not include a provision for detecting jaywalking pedestrians, the agency said.</p>

      <p>Instead, <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/uber/">Uber</a> relied on a human operator to pay attention and stop the vehicle to avoid a crash. But the company’s driver was streaming a television show and looking down just before the crash. The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-transportation-safety-board/">NTSB</a> said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/uber/">Uber</a> had cameras monitoring the drivers, but it didn’t do spot checks to make sure they were paying attention.</p>
      <p>It said <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/uber/">Uber</a> has made many safety improvements since the crash, including activating the braking systems, better training of human backup drivers, adding a second driver and hiring a safety director.</p>
      <p>Herzberg was impaired by methamphetamines at the time of the crash and crossed a road in the dark away from an intersection, according to the <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-transportation-safety-board/">NTSB</a> staff.</p>

        <p>The <a href="https://www.washingtontimes.com/topics/national-transportation-safety-board/">board</a> will determine the cause of the crash at the Tuesday hearing and make recommendations.</p>
