      <p>The government has asked Ghanaians to disregard an independence declaration for 'Western Togoland' by a Volta Region-based group.</p>
      <p>A statement from the Information Ministry said, “state security agencies are taking the necessary measures to ensure that persons involved with the illegal act are dealt with in accordance with the law.”</p>
      <p>“Ghana remains a sovereign state which has not ceded any part of its territory to any person or group of persons,” the statement said.</p>
      <p>The group, Homeland Study Group Foundation (HSGF) announced the separation on their official social media handles on Saturday, November 16, after a group meeting was held in Ho, the Volta Regional capital.</p>
      <p>“Today the 16th of November 2019, the leader of Western Togoland independence Mr Charles Kormi Kudzodzi has announced the separation of Western Togoland from Ghana. He cited numerous reasons as the bases for which the union that was not established must not be recognized. More information will soon reach the General public soon,” they wrote on Facebook.</p>
      <p>The group has been championing independence of the Volta Region [now including Oti Region] and parts of the Northern, North East and Upper East Regions.</p>
      <p>The group argues that the territories formed part of the former Western Togoland.</p>
      <p>Before Ghana became independent, the people of the region voted in a plebiscite to join Ghana since they were both under British authority.</p>
      <p>But the Homeland Study Group Foundation says the agreement included forming a union. Per their understanding, the said union has not been established and after the deadline expired in 2007, they started pushing for separation from Ghana.</p>
      <p>Members of the group have been arrested more than once and brought up on treason charges.</p>
      <p>They, however, remain defiant.</p>
