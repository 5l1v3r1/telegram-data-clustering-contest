      <p>The Delhi government is set to open 100 new mohalla clinics by the end of the month, which will take the total number of such clinics in the city to 411.</p>
      <p>“Of these 100 new clinics, some are on sites provided by land-owning agencies while others will be set up on rented accommodations… The rent agreements are being finalised,” said a senior health official.</p>
      <p>The AAP-led government had set a target of setting up 1,000 mohalla clinics across the city by the end of this year. At present there are 311 mohalla clinics, of which 100 were inaugurated by CM <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/arvind-kejriwal">Arvind Kejriwal</a> last month.</p>
      <p>“This is the most ambitious project and a patient-friendly initiative which has benefited a large number of people. The government wants to meet the proposed target by the end of its tenure,” added the official.</p>
      <p>Recently, during an inspection of a mohalla clinic in Greater Kailash, the CM said residents of posh colonies are no longer going to private hospitals and are coming to mohalla clinics instead.</p>
      <p>“Hiring of doctors is already in place and we are in the process of renting new places to establish mohalla clinics. We have already conducted written examinations to empanel pharmacists, mohalla clinic assistants and multi-task workers and they are being posted on a regular basis to deliver quality services to the public at large as a doorstep service,” said Dr Shaily Kamra, state nodal officer, Delhi government.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the government approved the construction of three new government hospitals in the city, each with a bed capacity of 650, in Madipur, Hatsal and Jwalapuri. The decisionwas approved Monday by the Expenditure Finance Committee headed by Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia.</p>
