      <p>ISLAMABAD (AP) - The International Tennis Federation has moved Pakistan’s Davis Cup matchup against India to a neutral venue in Kazakhstan.</p>
      <p>The best-of-five series between the fierce political rivals will be played in Nur-Sultan on Nov. 29-30.</p>
      <p>The ITF says “the Davis Cup Committee has voted in favor of the tie being hosted by the ITF on neutral ground.”</p>
      <p>Aisam-ul-Haq, Pakistan’s top player, expressed his disappointment after India refused to play in Islamabad. He now says he will not play in Kazakhstan.</p>
      <p>India last traveled to Pakistan for the Davis Cup in 1964 and went on to win 4-0. Pakistan last visited India in 2006, losing 3-2 in Mumbai.</p>
