        <b>Albert Rodriguez</b>
      </p>
      <p>Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the SBS 2019 Third Quarter Conference Call. On today's call, we provide an overview of recent operating developments and review our financial results. Joining me today are Jose Molina, our Chief Financial Officer; and Richard Lara, our General Counsel. Our third quarter results marked a continuation of several important trends. First, solid industry-leader top-line growth in our audio business where revenues were up 7% compared to last year.</p>
      <p>Second, we are translating that top-line growth into industry-leading adjusted operating margins. We delivered 40% margins in the third quarter. Several of our audio stations remain top ranked across the nation's largest suspended DMAs. All of our key digital mobile and social media engagement metrics are up significantly compared to last year, as we continue transforming SPS into a Hispanic multimedia company and certified minority business enterprise.</p>
      <p>And lastly, our total aggregate multi-platform audience is growing as our commitment to innovation, compelling content and unique experiences further resonates with our audience. The underlying power of our assets and the successful execution of our multimedia strategy are clearly working. We've made tremendous progress in 2019 and the entire SBS team is focused on building on the momentum across our business and finishing the year strong.</p>
      <p>Turning now to an update of our operations. And we will begin with our Aire Radio network. Performance at Aire was solid in the third quarter as gross revenues increased 7%. This marked the third consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year sales growth at Aire. In fact, year-to-date Aire network sales are up 17% compared to the first nine months of last year. Our consistent strong growth at Aire is being driven by strong execution by our sales teams, as well as the benefits of our unmatched reach and increasing market share. Aire's competitive offerings also include new innovative content opportunities and increased affiliate growth on all of our syndicated programs.</p>
      <p>Today Aire operates in the nation's largest minority certified language audio group. Aire reached its 15 million weekly listeners of which 73% is unique and nearly a 100 markets nationwide including 47 of the top 50 U.S. Hispanic markets. Despite the fact that audio ratings have been down across-the-board, Aire continues to maintain consistent audience share and ratings and key demos. Our dominant reach along with innovative content and leading industry talent relationships is driving new brand partners and sponsorship opportunities. Today clients are increasingly looking to connect with the rapidly expanding US Hispanic population given their sizable influence and increasing purchasing power.</p>
      <p>Aire offers our partners opportunity to reach this growing and highly engaged audience through an affiliate network of over 300 stations nationwide that reaches over 95% of U.S. Hispanic DMAs. Given our national reach, strong DMA coverage, growing audience, leading content and integrated offerings and quarter-to-quarter out industry outperformance, the path forward at Aire is bright. Our team is laser-focused on building on our successes to date in 2019 and finishing the year on the strong results.

This marked our seventh consecutive quarter in the industry outperformance. In our audio business, we remain well-positioned across the nation's densest Hispanic markets and once again delivered industry-leading operating margins. Today, we operate the two top stations in the nation's largest Hispanic DMA in New York and the top two in the second ranked market Los Angeles, we're building on this top DMA leadership through a focused approach to further growing our audience in Miami, the number three Hispanic DMA, as well as in Puerto Rico.</p>

      <p>We have just launched a new afternoon show focused on political news with veteran and renowned journalists Mario Andres Moreno. And finally Puerto Rico remains a critical emerging market for SBS and we're making steady progress building a leadership position. We've worked the last year to introduce new compelling station formats and leverage our exclusive content and strong talent roster to drive audience share. Advertising categories that were strong during the third quarter included entertainment, financial retail and telecommunications categories that we experienced some softness included political and travel.</p>
      <p>Lastly according to Miller Kaplan, we continue to outperform our competition in the markets we serve. During the third quarter, we outperformed our markets by 600 basis points.</p>

      <p>Now let me turn the call over to Jose Molina for the financial overview.</p>
      <p>
        <b>José Molina</b>
      </p>
      <p>Thank you, Albert. Turning to our third-quarter results. Our consolidated revenues totaled $36.3 million, up 7% compared to $34 million for the same prior-year period. This increase was due to higher revenues in our radio segment. Excluding political sales for the respective periods, our consolidated revenues totaled $36.2 million, up 10% compared to $32.8 million for the same prior-year period. Our radio revenues increased by 7% due to increases in local digital network special events and barter sales which were partially offset by a decrease in national sales.</p>
      <p>Excluding political sales for the respective periods, our radio revenues totaled $32.5 million, up 10% compared to $29.5 million for the same prior-year period. Our television revenues remained flat due to an increase in local sales which was partially offset by a decrease in national political sales. Excluding political sales for the respective periods, our television revenues totaled $3.7 million, up 14% compared to $3.3 million for the same prior-year period.</p>
      <p>Our consolidated adjusted OIBDA a non-GAAP measure totaled $10.7 million compared to $11.1 million for the same prior year period, representing a decrease of 4%. Excluding political for the respective periods, our consolidated adjusted OIBDA totaled $10.6 million, up 7% compared to $9.9 million for the same prior-year period. Our radio adjusted OIBDA increased 11%, primarily due to the increase in net revenues of $2.2 million, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses of $1 million.</p>
      <p>Our radio station operating expenses increased mainly due to increases in special event expenses and compensation and benefit related expenses. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in barter. Excluding political for the respective periods, our radio adjusted OIBDA totaled $13 million, up 17% compared to $11.1 million for the same prior-year period. Our television adjusted OIBDA decreased by approximately $800,000 due to increases in operating expenses in originally produced content costs and barter expenses. Excluding political for the respective period, our television adjusted OIBDA totaled approximately $600,000 compared to $1 million for the same prior-year period.</p>
      <p>Our corporate expenses increased approximately $800,000 mostly due to increases in compensation and insurance. Capital expenditures for the third quarter were approximately $1.1 million. And as of today, we have approximately $16.5 million of cash on hand. As we previously stated, we continue to work with our advisors evaluating all available options to refinance the notes, which could include the issuance of new debt or equity, asset sale proceeds and the use of cash on hand. We do not have expected timeframe to complete the refinancing because our refinancing efforts have been complicated by our Series B preferred stock litigation and the current ownership issue.</p>
      <p>The recapitalization of this company is our highest priority in addition to continuing to run this company successfully. This will conclude our formal remarks and with that I will like to turn the call over to the operator for any questions. Operator?</p>
