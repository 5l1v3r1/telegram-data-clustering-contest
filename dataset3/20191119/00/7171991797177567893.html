      <p>We’ve seen 3D image projection tried in a variety of different ways, but this is a new one to us. This volumetric display by Interact Lab of the University of Sussex <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXN9HjLJvdc">creates a 3D image by projecting light onto a tiny foam ball</a>, which zips around in the air fast enough to create a persistence of vision effect. (Video, embedded below.) How is this achieved? With a large array of ultrasonic transducers, performing what researchers call ‘acoustic trapping’.</p>
      <p>This is the same principle behind <a href="https://hackaday.com/2018/11/28/72-tranducers-for-acoustic-levitation/">acoustic levitation devices</a> which demonstrate how lightweight objects (like tiny polystyrene foam balls) can be made to defy gravity. But this 3D display is capable of not only moving the object in 3D space, but doing so at a high enough speed and with enough control to produce a persistence of vision effect. <a href="http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/86930/">The abstract for their (as yet unreleased) paper</a> claims the trapped ball can be moved at speeds of up to several meters per second.</p>
      <p>It has a few other tricks up its sleeve, too. The array is capable of simultaneously creating sounds as well as providing a limited form of tactile feedback by letting a user touch areas of high and low air pressure created by the transducers. These areas can’t be the same ones being occupied by the speeding ball, of course, but it’s a neat trick. Check out the video below for a demonstration.</p>

      <p>Acoustic levitation has applications far beyond just levitating some lightweight objects. <a href="https://hackaday.com/2018/08/09/hackaday-belgrade-asier-marzo-explains-acoustic-levitation/">Check out this talk from [Asier Marzo]</a>; you might be surprised at the number of fields with clever applications for acoustic levitation.</p>
