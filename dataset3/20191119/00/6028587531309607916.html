      <p>According to several sources, gelato dates back to 16<sup>th</sup> Century Florence when this tasty frozen treat was created. Now a worldwide sensation, gelato has come a long way and evolved over the years. When I switched from vegetarian to vegan close to a decade ago I thought I would have to give up my favorite ice cream and gelato flavors, but this is definitely not the case. These days big companies are selling plant-based versions of all my favorite ice cream flavors from childhood. Furthermore, shops around the world are adding plant-based options to their gelato menus in addition to fruit sorbets that are typically vegan anyhow because they don’t contain dairy. Italians enjoy gelato all year round with locally sourced ingredients and I was excited to explore vegan options in Italy. I was traveling with <a href="https://www.intrepidtravel.com/us">Intrepid Travel</a> on an organized tour from Venice to Rome via San Gimignano, Florence and Bologna. This list focuses specifically on theses Italian destinations. As for other cities in Italy, I will definitely need to go back and do more gelato based vegan research. <b>Venice – Majer Venezia</b></p>

      <p>Venice was my first introduction to Italy and needless to say this charming city built on canals is magical. Bring your sense of adventure because the best way to explore Venice is to get lost in Venice. There are small bridges crisscrossing over the canals, ancient buildings with bright flowers hanging from balconies, stylish locals chatting and drinking with friends, happy tourists riding gondolas and history around every corner. I got to know my Intrepid traveling companions from around the world as we enjoyed our first meal together in the Jewish Quarter at <a href="https://www.majer.it/ghetto">Majer Venezia</a>, located in the Campo del Ghetto Vecchio next to the Synagogue. For desert there are two vegan flavours of gelato so of course I tried both, mango and strawberry. The fresh fruity flavours were smooth and delicious and despite the huge portions there were no leftovers.</p>

        <b>Bologna – Officina di OGGI Gelato</b>

      <p>Bologna is a bustling university city packed with students eager to learn and enough shops and restaurants to satisfy everyone’s taste. There are medieval towers, historical monuments and a rich Italian history to explore. <a href="https://oggigelato.it/">Officina di OGGI Gelato</a> is fabulous and tourists and locals both vouch for it. If I had time in my busy schedule I would have gone back to Officina di OGGI Gelato again. This small adorable shop had decadent vegan chocolate gelato and I paired it with a tangy peach. It was extremely hot outside and our gelato indulgence was so tasty and refreshing that some of my travel companions went back for seconds and thirds, it was seriously that good.</p>

        <b>Florence – Gelateria Perche No</b>

      <p>My time in Florence was very brief but very magical and I instantly fell in love with the vibe, ambience and buzz of this charismatic city. The Italian language, which stems directly from Latin, began in Florence back in the 13<sup>th</sup> Century and has eventually transformed into the modern Italian of today<b>. </b><a href="https://www.facebook.com/GelateriaPercheNo/">Gelateria Perche No</a> opened back in 1939 and is and one of the oldest in Italy. All their fruit flavors are vegan and created only with fruit, water and sugar - no dyes or preservatives. They serve a creamy chocolate sorbet and soy and rice milk based gelato so arrive hungry to try multiple flavors. They also carry harder to find vegan flavors like fig, pomegranate and hazelnut.</p>

        <b>San Gimignano – Gelateria Dondoli</b>
      </p>

      <p>San Gimignano is a delightful medieval village with so much to explore. This gorgeous UNESCO World Heritage site in Tuscany is surrounded by 13<sup>th</sup> century walls and often referred to as the Town of Fine Towers because their ancient towers rise above other buildings. We all admired the ancient view while walking along the Via Francigena with our kind local Intrepid guide. She explained this was a major pilgrimage route to Rome back in the middle ages. Our reward for this long hike was a visit to an award-winning gelateria in the village, <a href="https://www.gelateriadondoli.com/home-uk.html">Gelateria Dondoli</a>. All their fruit flavors are vegan and I figured I deserved three scoops after the long trek. My gelato trio was made up of mango, pink grapefruit and strawberry. The long line up out the door is a testament to the shops popularity.</p>

      <p>Rome was the last stop on our tour of Italy and we arrived by train to this Eternal City. There are so many sites worth visiting such as the Coliseum, Trevi Fountain, Pantheon, Piazza del Campidoglio, Vatican City, and the Jewish Quarter. While exploring ancient Rome save time to visit <a href="http://www.gelarmony.it/">Gelarmony</a> as they really cater to vegans with a large range of flavors. The gelato shop is located near an urban square called Piazza del Popolo inside the northern gate of the city. In addition to regular sorbets, Gelarmony has a separate room for their vegan gelato and also serves vegan whipped cream and cones. Flavours are plentiful with caramel, cinnamon, coffee, walnut, pistachio and of course chocolate. You may want to consider several scoops, after all, you need energy to keep exploring Rome.</p>
