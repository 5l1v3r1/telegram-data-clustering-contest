      <p>PICKENS, S.C. (WYFF) - New details were released Monday about the accidental shooting of an 11-year-old Saturday in Pickens County.</p>
      <p>
        <a href="https://www.wyff4.com/article/pickens-county-girl-dies-when-fathers-gun-accidentally-goes-off-during-target-practice-deputies-say/29832076">The shooting happened on Shady Grove Road, Chief Deputy Chad Brooks with the Pickens County Sheriff’s Office said.</a>
      </p>
      <p>When deputies arrived they were told the victim, 11-year-old Kylee Dawn Woods, was taken to the hospital in a personal vehicle, Brooks said.</p>
      <p>During the investigation, detectives said they determined that several family members were target practicing at the home with multiple weapons.</p>
      <p>An incident report said Woods’ father was attempting to unload a .40-caliber handgun, when it accidentally discharged, striking Woods, who was standing beside him.</p>
      <p>The report said Woods was taken to the hospital by her father and grandfather.</p>
      <p>Woods was later pronounced dead at the hospital. The weapon was turned over to deputies at the scene.</p>
      <p>The father told authorities that he had only fired the weapon a few times but that it had never malfunctioned, the report said.</p>
      <p>The report indicated that authorities took statements from two other people at the home. Their statements were consistent with the father's account.</p>
      <p>"All information obtained in the investigation thus far does not indicate any obvious signs of foul play," Brooks said. "It appears that this is just a very tragic accident."</p>
      <p>“The prayers of the entire Sheriff’s Office are with this family, and I hope that people will respect their need for privacy as they deal with this tragedy," Sheriff Rick Clark added.</p>
