      <p><a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/afc-bournemouth">Bournemouth</a> winger <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/ryan-fraser">Ryan Fraser</a> has sent the rumour mill churning once again by suggesting that he is unsettled at the Vitality Stadium following the departure of Marc Pugh.</p>
      <h3>Fraser says he's become a 'loner' at Bournemouth after Pugh's summer departure</h3>
      <p>Fraser, who joined the Cherries from Aberdeen in 2013, has been heavily linked with an exit in recent months and has even put the brakes on a contract extension at the club.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old emerged as one of the most creative players in the <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/go/epl">Premier League</a>, having registered seven goals and 14 assists in the previous season as well as a goal and two assists so far this term. Overall, the winger has been involved in an impressive 40 of Bournemouth's goals in the English top-flight.</p>

      <p>Liverpool, Arsenal, and Everton have all been rumoured to be interested in the Scotland international, who will be available for free next summer.</p>
      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/sport/18042614.seeing-friends-like-marc-pugh-depart-afc-bournemouth-hard-take-admits-ryan-fraser">Bournemouth Echo</a>, Fraser has now implied that he is less happy at the club, following Pugh's move to Championship club Queens Park Rangers over the summer.</p>

      <p>He said,</p>
      <blockquote>"He’s my best mate off the pitch so to see him go on loan (to Hull last season) was hard. I was obviously back to being a loner again! Pughie is Pughie. You can’t say a bad word about Pughie. He’s probably one of the nicest guys. Nath (Ake) is up there as well and then I’d say myself maybe third!</blockquote>
      <blockquote>"He’ll look out for you. Like last year he just invited me round for Christmas. My family weren’t down, I hadn’t seen them in maybe a year and then Pughie just asked me to go for Christmas with him. He didn’t have to do it but that’s just the type of guy he is.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>"Me, Shaun MacDonald and Wes Fogden always used to do stuff together. So obviously losing one and then we keep losing them and then last season was hard – I used to go and have a coffee with Pughie, but it wasn’t like that. So you end up just going home and doing nothing. It’s hard to take."</blockquote>
      <p>The Cherries will likely want to cash in on Fraser before his contract expires but it remains to be seen if the likes of Liverpool and Arsenal make a move for the winger in the winter transfer window.</p>
