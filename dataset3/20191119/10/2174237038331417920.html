      <p>Organisers of the UK’s 2000 Trees have revealed named <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/jimmy-eat-world-how-we-wrote-the-middle">Jimmy Eat World</a> as their first 2020 headliner.</p>
      <p>The festival will take place on July 9-11 at Upcote Farm near Cheltenham in Gloucestershire, with 2000 Trees’ James Scarlett saying: “We don’t usually announce 2000 Trees bands before Christmas, but having Jimmy Eat World as main stage headliner just got us too damn excited.</p>
      <p>“I’m absolutely certain this is going to be our biggest and best lineup ever. We have another 50-odd bands ready to go, but I’m afraid you’ll have to wait until January for details. My advice is get your tickets now before it sells out!” </p>
      <p>Jimmy Eat World will headline the Thursday night and will play in support of their 10th studio album <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/self-doubt-discovery-and-survival-inside-jimmy-eat-worlds-new-album"><i>Surviving</i></a> which launched last month.</p>
      <p>Last year saw 2000 Trees ban plastic across the festival site and introduce the GreenGoblet cup scheme, which contributed to a six tonne reduction in in waste compared to the 2018 festival.</p>
      <p>Organisers have also teamed up with two charities for the 2020 festival: <a href="http://www.attitudeiseverything.org.uk/">Attitude Is Everything </a>and <a href="https://www.treeaid.org.uk/">Tree Aid</a>.</p>
      <p>Attitude Is Everything works with fans, artists and the live music industry to improve deaf and disabled people’s access to live music.</p>
      <p>CEO Suzanne Bull says: “I’m thrilled that 2000 Trees are the first music company to announce how they are going to ‘play their part’ in Attitude Is Everything’s 20th anniversary next year. </p>
      <p>“Fans and guests of the festival will be able to donate to us when purchasing their tickets.”</p>
      <p>Tree Aid, meanwhile, helps protect the environment and works with local communities in Africa to help them grow trees for themselves and for future generations.</p>
