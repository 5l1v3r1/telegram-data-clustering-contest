      <p><b>Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior Trailer Review:</b> It’s raining for historic films in Bollywood but how many of them really excite you with its first trailer?</p>
      <p><i>Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior</i>‘s trailer is surely among the best cut Bollywood movie trailers in recent times and also among the best trailers of all historic Bollywood films. The scale, the grandeur, the performances, the sets, the cinematography, everything comes together to make things look as grand as it gets.</p>

      <p>The story itself is larger than life and since it’s true and is based on Indian history, the audience is bound to get excited.</p>
      <p>Ajay Devgn is very good. Though I hope he is better in the film because the character he’s playing is very demanding. Saif Ali Khan throws a mega surprise and he has simply blown me away with his performance. After watching him in the trailer, I can say that he will surely pull a great number of audience to cinemas on his own. Kajol packs a punch too.</p>
      <p>Overall, <i>Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior</i>‘s team has come up with a powerful trailer which will help the film gain great buzz before its release. If the film has good music and promotions then it will take a big opening at the Box Office for sure.</p>
      <p>Directed by Om Raut, <i>Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior</i> is slated to release on January 10, 2019.</p>
