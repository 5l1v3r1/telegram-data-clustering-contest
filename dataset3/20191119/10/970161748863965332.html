      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/lewis-capaldi/">Lewis Capaldi</a> might have been one of the acts performing at the Royal Variety Performance this year, but entertaining the crowd started long before he took to the stage.</p>
      <p>The singer, 23, was seen pulling some rather interesting faces as he arrived at the London Palladium ahead of the big night.</p>
      <p>Lewis appeared to be blinded by the camera flashes as he made his way into the venue, gesticulating wildly for the photographers.</p>
      <p>The performance was recorded on Monday evening, but will be shown on television in December, and is always a star-studded affair.</p>
      <p>As well as Lewis’s performance, other stars taking the stage on the night included Britain’s Got Talent winner Colin Thackery and Frank Skinner, as well as Rod Stewart who had to pull out at the last minute due to a throat infection.</p>
      <p>The event is always attended by a royal or two, and this year saw Prince William and Kate Middleton attend for the third time.</p>

      <p>The Daily Mail reports that the couple told Lewis they ‘love’ his music, to which he added: ‘I mean they might have been lying, but they seemed genuine. The Duke also told me that I could talk for Britain.’</p>

      <p>The event is in aid of the Royal Variety Charity, also known as The Entertainment Artistes’ Benevolent Fund, which Queen Elizabeth is a patron of.</p>
      <p>The money raised from the annual show helps entertainers throughout the UK who need assistance as a result of old age, ill-health or hardship.</p>
      <p>The Royal Variety performance has been held annually since 1912, and the winner of Britain’s Got Talent is awarded a slot to perform every year since 2007 as part of their prize.</p>
      <p>This year’s show, which was hosted by Romesh Ranganathan and Rob Beckett, will be broadcast in December, with the date to be announced.</p>
