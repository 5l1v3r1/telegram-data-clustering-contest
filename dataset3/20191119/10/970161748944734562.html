      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-charles/">Prince Charles</a> and Camilla kicked off another day in New Zealand with a full Maori welcome on the grounds of Auckland’s Government House.</p>
      <p>The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall performed the hongi with elders Kaumatua and Kuia, a greeting which involves two people pressing their noses and foreheads together.</p>
      <p>They then watched as a Maori warrior lay down a dart in a challenge, known as a wero, carried out to ensure visitors come in peace.</p>

      <p>Members of the New Zealand Defence Force’s Maori cultural group then performed a karanga, a call of welcome, followed by a haka – and also greeted the royals with the hongi.</p>
      <p>Charles took the Royal Salute and inspected the Guard, before going on to hold private audiences with New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and opposition leader Simon Bridges.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Camilla enjoyed high tea and listened to speeches from a paralympian, model and two schoolgirls at a Women of the World (WOW) event.</p>
      <p>The festival was launched by Jude Kelly in 2010 and aims to celebrate female achievement and examine what obstacles women and girls face in achieving their potential.</p>
      <p>Among the speakers was Alexia Hilbertidou, 20, who founded GirlBoss New Zealand as a teenager to close the gender gap in science, maths, technology and leadership.</p>
      <p>She said: ‘When I was 16, I was the only girl in my digital technology class, and later the only girl in my advanced physics class and it was a very isolating experience.</p>
      <p>‘I started to wonder “Why are so many of my female friends who are so intelligent and so capable not going into these fields and not feeling like they belong?”‘</p>

      <p>Camilla, president of WOW, also spoke at the event and thanked the ‘wonderful ladies’ for being brave enough to share their experiences.</p>
      <p>She continued: ‘Wherever on the planet the festival takes place, it addresses particular issues affecting women’s lives there.</p>
      <p>‘It gives women a chance to face the obstacles that block their paths and talk about the different solutions to the challenges in their life.</p>
      <p>‘Above all, it celebrates and supports the achievements of multiple women and girls of every culture and community.’</p>

      <p>The duchess also paid tribute a visit to staff at domestic violence charity Shine, which stands for Safer Homes in New Zealand Everyday.</p>
      <p>During the meeting, she told them: ‘You’re all doing a brilliant job. Just listening to the survivors is so important. Hopefully today we can up the ante and raise a bit of awareness.’</p>
      <p>Charles and Camilla are visiting New Zealand from November 17 to 23, in their first joint visit since 2015.</p>
      <p>The Prince of Wales recently completed a two-day tour of India without the duchess.</p>
      <p>The couple will next move on to Waitangi, a significant region in the history of New Zealand where a treaty was signed on the relationship between the Maori and Crown.</p>
