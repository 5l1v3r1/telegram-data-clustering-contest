      <p>Twenty years out from the release of their debut album <i>Liberation Afrobeat Vol. 1</i>, <a href="https://antibalas.com/"><b>Antibalas</b></a> will release a new album, <i>Fu Chronicles</i>, on February 7 via <a href="https://daptonerecords.com/">Daptone</a>. We’re premiering lead single “Fight Am Finish,” which is a triumphant blend of jazz, funk, Afrobeat, and more, and comes with a powerful message. Singer Duke Amayo says:</p>
      <blockquote>We have arrived at a time when we must be ‘Seshat in Red Gloves’ and punch throw the sand curtain of Lies and deceit.<br/>We must fight for the Truth.<br/>We must fight for Sustainability.<br/>We must fight for Peace.<br/>We must Fight for our Dreams.<br/>We must Fight am finish and never ever give up the good fight, for the Destiny of Truth is Exposure. Triple triple triple exposure!</blockquote>
      <p>And founder/baritone saxophonist Martin Perna adds:</p>
      <blockquote>The only constant, really, has been change. The country is both very different and at the same time more of its true self than ever. We’ve seen so much displacement, dashing of communities. Over these twenty years, our musical community has taken many licks but we are still holding it together and have a lot of creative energy to work with. I see this song ‘Fight Am Finish’ in particular as a testament to commitment, to seeing something through to the end.</blockquote>
