      <p>International Men’s Day is celebrated every year on November 19. On this day, the importance of setting the right example is communicated and awareness is sought to be spread among men. It also serves as a fitting occasion to shed light on the issues men wrestle with on a daily basis.</p>
      <p>According to a report from CALM (Campaign Against Living Miserably), quoted by the <i>The Independent</i>, male suicide remains one of the biggest killer of men under the age of 45 in UK. International Men’s Day makes for a good opportunity to highlight problems associated with toxic masculinity and issues that prevent men from expressing themselves. The same report states that the theme for this year is “making a difference for men and boys”. The organisers aim to encourage men to become positive male role models for each other.</p>
      <p>Patriarchy affects both men and women and a day like this assumes more importance simply because it acknowledges the pressure men deal with on a regular basis. If society dictates a particular role for women, it does the same for men and more often than not, the boots are bigger and filling them can be a struggle, affecting their mental health. They are expected to look, behave a certain way and any deviance is made fun of. And therefore, even though every day is technically their day, a special occasion like this acknowledges the pressure and rightly so.</p>
