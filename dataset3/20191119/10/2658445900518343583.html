      <p>Nigerian alternative music star, Simi Ogunleye has deemed audience ‘unrealistic’ expectations from artist as one of the main issues plaguing the music industry.</p>
      <p>News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that in a series of Twitter posts @simplysimi, she noted that Nigerian musicians are forced to cater to the same audience and switch their sounds to feed them.</p>
      <p>According to the ‘Soldier’ singer, artists are forced to be versatile even when they have their own original sounds, as musical legends are usually monotonous in their sounds.</p>
      <p>“I think one of the most trying things Naija artistes deal with is that we are mostly catering to the same audience.</p>
      <p>“We don’t want to have to, but the structure of the industry makes it inevitable. We expect the same people to like Rap, street music, soul, pop, indie. Its strange.</p>
      <p>“Strange for the audience because they keep messing around with your preference. You expect everyone to please you.</p>
      <p>“Zlatan and Johnny Drille. Strange for the artist cos they keep messing around with your creativity. You expect everybody to like your music. A waste of time.</p>

      <p>“So when I see someone tell an artist “you’re monotonous’’, it amuses me. Most of the legends are monotonous.</p>
      <p>“Unless they don’t have a sound. Imagine Fela doing hip-hop today and RnB tomorrow or Whitney Houston – Soul today, akpala tomorrow,’’ she said.</p>
      <p>NAN reports that Simi, who is married to fellow alternative singer, Adekunle Gold recently released a new album, ‘Omo Charlie Champagne’.</p>
      <p>The album swiftly follows her acclaimed 2017 eponymous album ‘Simisola’ which went on to win ‘Album of the Year’ at the Headies and contained a bunch of fantastic singles, including ‘Joromi’ and ‘Lovin.”</p>
