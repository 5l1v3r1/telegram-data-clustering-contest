      <h1>Protect your smartphone with 20% off Defense cases and chargers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T10:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://mashable.com/author/cemile-kavountzis/" target="_blank">Cemile Kavountzis</a></address>
      <p><b>TL;DR:</b> Save 20% off <a href="https://zdcs.link/655NZ">Defense cases and chargers</a> with the coupon code 20MASHABLE for a limited time.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>In a mega-multitasking world, phone fumbles happen all the time. Even if you’re not walking and texting (and let’s be honest, most of us do that <a href="https://mashable.com/2012/05/25/texting-and-walking/">regularly</a>) or snapping pics in touchscreen-enabled gloves, phones have a way of slipping out of our hands at the worst possible places (concrete sidewalk, anyone?).</p>
      <p>While early generations of the iPhone were as fragile as teacups, the iPhone 11 series launched with a focus on increased durability. However, <a href="https://mashable.com/article/iphone-11-durability-test/">when put to the test</a>, even these toughened-up versions can still crack under pressure. Get some peace of mind, protect your precious devices, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/655NZ">save 20% off all Defense cases and chargers</a> with the code 20MASHABLE.</p>
      <p>Here's why this deal is worth it:</p>
      <h3>Drop-proofed protection</h3>
      <p>Engineered from hard polycarbonate, rubber, and anodized aluminum, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/p88DD">Defense Shield case for iPhone 11 Pro</a> offers military-grade drop protection to withstand falls from six to 10 feet. It’s like bubble-wrapping your phone and putting it into a metal case, only better looking and more convenient.</p>
      <h3>Transparency is a good thing</h3>
      <p>After plunking down a grand (or more) on a smartphone, you might not want to cover up all that sleek design. For the stylishly minded, the case has a clear, polycarbonate back panel to protect from damage — and still look like an iPhone, so people know where you stand in the smartphone wars.</p>
      <h3>Improved audio</h3>
      <p>Since the Defense team wasn’t impressed with the iPhone 11 Pro’s sound without headphones, they integrated a sound channel to amplify the bottom speaker and redirect the sound to the front for less awkward speakerphone conversations. Can your case do that?</p>
      <h3>Fast, multitasking charging</h3>
      <p>For added convenience, bundle a <a href="https://zdcs.link/3PPrm">Defense Vertical Duo wireless charger</a> or buy it on its own. The space-saving station charges two Qi-enabled devices simultaneously and an additional device with a USB port.</p>
      <h3>The bottom line on breakage</h3>
      <p>The reality: even strong glass screens can crack, and replacements are costly. (<a href="https://www.corning.com/gorillaglass/worldwide/en/glass-types/gorilla-glass-5.html">Corning</a>, the company that produces the new iPhone screen, doesn’t even promise invincibility for its glass solutions — only improved drop protection.) An even bigger tell? Apple lists a price for replacing an iPhone 11 Pro screen, which will set you back <a href="https://support.apple.com/iphone/repair/service/screen-replacement">$279</a> out of warranty versus spending less than $30 on a case.</p>
