      <h1>Harry Winks’ old coach explains why he converted him to a central midfielder</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T10:45:03+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 10:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/tom-procter/" target="_blank">Tom Procter</a></address>
      <p>A former coach of Harry Winks has explained why he made the decision to convert the star into a central midfielder.</p>
      <p>Russell Small, now a part-time coach at Hastings United, was the man who told the England international to play through the middle when he was a youngster.</p>
      <p>Winks started out as a free-scoring winger, but Small saw potential in him to control games.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7699251/Russel-Small-man-hailed-making-decision-play-Harry-Winks-middle.html">Speaking to The Daily Mail</a>, he said: “When he was a little winger he scored lots of goals, but my idea of playing him in the middle was that he would be more involved and use all his skills much more.</p>
      <p>“It made my day to hear him say it’s the best advice he’s been given. If it has stuck in his mind for this long, obviously it was a good decision on my part!</p>
      <p>“He took it in his stride. It was already there, that natural ability to read the game and be technically good enough to do what we wanted.”</p>
      <p>Winks is a popular figure amongst Tottenham fans and, at the age of 23, the talented star is still many years away from his peak.</p>

      <p>Technician Winks has been likened to Spanish legend Andres Iniesta before, but that isn’t exactly the comparison Small would make.</p>
      <p>“If there was anyone I would compare him to it would be Zinedine Zidane,” he added. “The way he could see a pass, short or long, he could go past a player and he scored goals.”</p>
      <h3>TBR’s view – Winks has an exciting future</h3>
      <p>Winks has a really exciting future ahead of him.</p>

      <p>His brilliant technical ability is something that will allow him to stand out, and his capability of dictating games is clear.</p>
      <p>He will likely never reach the level of the legendary Zidane, but it’s certainly a nice assessment from Small.</p>
