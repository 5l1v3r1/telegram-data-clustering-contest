                <p><i>“</i>Pele is incomparable. Anybody who wants to compare Pele to any other athlete…do you know what I do? I hear but I don’t listen.

                      <p>“I meant he’s extraordinary to the present time and among humans, with his creativity. Pele is out of normal patterns, and I’m not saying this because I’m a Brazilian. You can’t find a defect.</p>
                      <p>“If somebody comes to me and starts to make comparisons, for me it has no credibility,” he concluded.</p>

                            <p>On the other hand, Messi has embarked his name as one of the best players to ever grace the game, his staggering stats certainly make his contest valid for being the greatest of all time.</p>
                            <p>In a 21-year career, Pele racked up 1,281 (a stat which is still disputed) goals for club and country, which included 77 strikes in 91 appearances for Brazil which made him win 3 world cups. Meanwhile, Messi is yet to win an international trophy with Argentina.</p>
