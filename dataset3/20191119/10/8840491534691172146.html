      <p>GALWAY-BASED skin specialist Bernie Fahy was recently honoured with an award from one of the world’s best-known dermatologists and anti-ageing experts, Dr. Christine Schrammek.</p>
      <p>Bernie, from Ballinrobe, was presented with the accolade for Best Business Development Ireland 2019 at a Schrammek convention in Germany. The convention was attended by more than 60 skincare professionals from all over the world, all of whom are distributors of the prestigious Schrammek range.</p>
      <p>Headquartered in the German city of Essen but with a presence in 50 countries worldwide, the Dr. med Christine Schrammek Kosmetik company is renowned for its extensive range of skincare products and services, including its pioneering Green Peel herbal peeling treatment.</p>
      <p>The citation at the event highlighted Bernie’s 'commitment, passion and knowledge' in relation to the products and services she provides.</p>
      <p>“I’m thrilled to have won the award,” said Bernie, a fully-qualified and licensed skin specialist with over 20 years’ experience in the UK and Ireland. “The Schrammek name is synonymous with the treatment of problem skin and that’s always been my passion, it’s what I’ve specialised in my whole professional life. So to be honoured by that company is very special.”</p>
      <p>Operating in Galway for the last 11 years, Bernie has built up her business in a rather unusual way.</p>
      <p>“I work myself out of work basically. People come to me with problem skin, I provide a free consultation and then develop a treatment programme tailored to their individual needs. When the programme is over – and the length will vary depending on the nature of the problem – I don’t see them again, but they will always refer me to someone else and that’s how my client base keeps being replenished.</p>
      <p>“Seeing the difference in people – particularly in terms of their self-confidence – when they leave me compared to when they first come through the door is so rewarding. It’s what I love about my work.”</p>
      <p>The focus of Bernie’s The Skin Specialist clinic, located in the Terryland Retail Park, is on natural solutions to complex skin problems.</p>
      <p>“I help people find sustainable, non-medication solutions to their issues. Everyone has a certain amount of stress in their lives, but some people may be going through a particularly tough time. They may be stressed at work, they might be recently bereaved or have gone through a relationship break-up. All of these factors can contribute to the problem so it’s important to look at it holistically,” she says.</p>
