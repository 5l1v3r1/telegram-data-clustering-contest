      <p>The new Commissioner of Police, Lagos State, CP Hakeem Odumosu has said that managing the menace of traffic in the metropolis would be his top priority.</p>
      <p>Odumosu disclosed this during a press briefing Monday in Ikeja.</p>
      <p><i>News Agency of Nigeria</i> reports that Odumosu took over from AIG Zubairu Muazu, who was recently promoted from Commissioner of Police to Assistant Inspector General of Police (AIG).</p>
      <p>Muazu has been posted to Force Headquarters, Abuja as AIG in charge of Counter-Terrorism Unit.</p>
      <p>The commissioner said that bad roads were the major cause of traffic in Lagos State, adding that poor attitude of drivers also contributed to the traffic problem in the state.</p>
      <p>“The Lagos State Government under Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu has started palliatives measures on all the roads especially now that the rains have subsided.</p>
      <p>“However, I urge him to increase more of the palliatives measures on the roads because bad roads contribute to traffic congestion.</p>
      <p>“If we have the government tackling bad roads from that angle and we the police on the road controlling the traffic, congestion would be reduced to a minimum.</p>
      <p>“Once traffic flows, we would have reduced crime by at least 30 per cent in the city,” Odumosu said.</p>
      <p>He said that more men would be mobilised from all sections of the police so that there would be enough personnel to manage traffic in the state.</p>
      <p>The commissioner also said that he had enlightened the various Divisional Police Officers (DPO) and Area Commanders on the need to change strategy towards traffic management.</p>
      <p>“We need to change our traffic management strategy such as the time of reporting for duty and the time of closing of the traffic officers.</p>
      <p>“The closing time of any traffic junction will be 10.00 p.m. and in areas where the traffic congestion is very serious, the time would be extended to 12 midnight,” he said.</p>
