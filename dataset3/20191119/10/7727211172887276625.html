      <p>Fans have said Holly Willoughby has made them 'feel cold' as she wowed in a "stunning" short dress.</p>
      <p>The 38-year-old opted for a black, high necked ruffle hem knitted dress from Reiss, costing £185 as she posted a snap of her outfit ahead of today's edition of <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/itv">ITV's</a> <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/this-morning">This Morning.</a></p>
      <p>It had a fitted finish as she decided to ditch the tights and go bare-legged with black heels to finish the look.</p>
