      <p>Following the footsteps of American singer Johnny Cash, rapper Kayne West gave an emotional performance for the inmates at a Houston jail. A video of the secret gig shows West singing songs of his new gospel album “Jesus is King”.</p>
      <p>Along with his choir, West performed for more than 200 male inmates at one jail facility and then visited another across the street, where he put on a show for female inmates, the NBC reported.</p>
      <p>In the two-minute video, which has gone viral on social media, West can be seen shaking hands and hugging a few inmates in their orange jumpsuits before beginning his performance. As the crowd grooved to the songs, some were seen getting emotional and teary-eyed as West went about his business.</p>
      <p>Following his first performance, West entered the second prison through a tunnel, which was kept a secret from the public and was approved by the prison officials, the Sky News reported.</p>
