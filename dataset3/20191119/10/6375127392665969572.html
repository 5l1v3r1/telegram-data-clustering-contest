      <h3>PALAYAN CITY – The Department of Environment and Natural Resources in Nueva Ecija is reportedly set to confer the posthumous award of “Bayani ng Kalikasan” to a fallen forest ranger who was killed last month shortly after leading an anti-illegal logging operation that led to the arrest of three men and the seizure of a mini-Elf truck loaded with wood contraband.</h3>
      <p>Aside from the posthumous award, DENR-PENRO Joselito “Joey” M. Blanco yesterday said that the family of slain forest ranger Ronaldo Corpuz is also set to receive a “monetary reward” which is still under process at the DENR central office of Sec. Roy A. Cimatu in Quezon City.</p>
      <p>Corpuz, 43, a member of the Freemasonry, was assigned to the MuHoz Science City community environment and natural resources office when he was shot by an unidentified gunman while closing the gates of his house in Bgy. Villa Joson, San Jose City on Oct. 25. He died the following day due to three gunshot wounds in the chest.</p>
      <p>A week after the DENR ranger’s shooting, police nabbed three suspects, including a police officer, identified as Corporal Harold Culala, assigned with the 2nd Provincial Mobile Force Company based in San Jose City.</p>
      <p>The other two suspects were Eugene Cayabyab, 46, of Bgy. Calaocan, Rizal, and the alleged hitman, Ariel Andrade, alias Amber, 30, of Sitio Masiway, Bgy. Sampalok, Pantabangan, who was killed inside a police station after grabbing a policeman’s gun.</p>
      <p>Blanco said Culala, who reportedly operates a wood furniture shop in San Jose City, was said to be the owner of the mini-Elf truck loaded with 472 board feet of Gmelina wood species that was seized by the group of Corpuz.</p>
      <p>After the shooting of Corpuz, Blanco revealed that also allegedly being targetted for liquidation is Leonardo Odasco, the immediate superior of Corpuz.</p>
