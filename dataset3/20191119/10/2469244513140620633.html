      <h2>Cornish Mutual offers tips on how to prevent damage, disruption and rising costs</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T10:47:15+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 10:47</time> by <a rel="author">Leena Sidat</a></address>
      <p>We have had our first cold snap of the year and forecasters are warning of ‘Scandinavian weather conditions’ in the months ahead. Whether or not the predictions are accurate, Cornish Mutual is advising homeowners to take steps now, to protect their properties.</p>
      <p>The south west insurer warns this is especially important for people with homes that are likely to be empty for a period of time over the winter.</p>
      <p>Claire Longman, technical leader at south west insurer <a href="http://www.cornishmutual.co.uk/">Cornish Mutual</a> says: "Sometimes it is inevitable that your property will be empty for a stretch of time. Perhaps you are going on a long holiday this winter, own a rental property and are between tenants, or are selling your home and have already moved out.  </p>
      <p>"Unoccupancy restrictions under your insurance policy are likely to apply during such periods."</p>
      <p>In order to prevent significant damage and disruption, Cornish Mutual suggests taking the following measures to protect your home in the winter months:</p>
      <p> </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Ensure that the boiler and heating system are regularly serviced, at least once a year, by a registered professional.</p>
          <p> </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Leave the heating on low, around 15 degrees Celsius, to prevent pipes freezing in very cold weather.</p>
          <p> </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Insulate your loft; the Energy Saving Trust recommends the minimum thickness of loft insulation should be 270mm.</p>
          <p> </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Ensure furniture isn’t too close to your radiators and heaters to allow heat to circulate.</p>
          <p> </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Leave loft covers or cupboard doors ajar, allowing warm air to circulate the voids.</p>
          <p> </p>
        </li>
        <li>Know the whereabouts of, and label the water shut off valve (stop tap). This will help you and others to quickly isolate the supply in the event of an emergency. You may wish to turn the water off and drain the pipes.</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Water pipes, cold water tanks and taps in unheated or vulnerable places should be lagged to help prevent pipes freezing.</p>
          <p> </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Visually check your pipes regularly. Plastic plumbing joints will degrade sooner than metal ones. Arrange to re-washer any dripping taps; if they freeze, they’ll block your pipes.</p>
          <p> </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Clear your gutters and drains from debris to prevent blockages which could leak into the roof and walls.</p>
          <p> </p>
        </li>
        <li>Ask a trusted friend or neighbour to check your property regularly.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Claire adds: “Dealing with the aftermath of property damage is not only costly but stressful. Homeowners can avoid being in this difficult situation with a little planning and by following some simple steps.”</p>
