      <p>Apple: new event on December 2 dedicated to applications and games<br/>5 (100%) 1 vote</p>
      <p>Apple is about to conclude 2019 with a further press event. But there will be no talk of new hardware devices but rather apps and games, the best ones published in the App Store during the year. The Cupertino company concluded the cycle of announcements of new products a few days ago with the introduction of the new MacBook Pro 16″, but there is still another appointment set for December 2 next in New York.</p>
      <p>The company led by Tim Cook has begun to send out invitations to the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/18/apple-announces-press-event-on-dec-2.html">media</a> through which you can see clearly what the subject of the presentation: “Join us for an Apple special event honoring our favorite apps and games of 2019”. It’s worth mentioning that the company annually announces the best apps and games. For iPhone, iPad, Mac and Apple TV. But so far it has done so with a simple statement, without organizing a real press event.</p>

      <p>Over the last year the company has stepped up its investments in the services sector. Activating new ones – think of Apple News +, TV+ and Arcade. It, therefore, appears to be consistent with the desire to diversify the offer, not only focusing on the sale of devices, to give even greater emphasis to what has always been one of the pillars of the <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/Apple">Apple</a> ecosystem, namely the App Store.</p>
      <p>This year the winner of the best games category could emerge from the selection of titles included in the Apple Arcade. It has recently cut the milestone of the 100 titles included in the service.</p>
