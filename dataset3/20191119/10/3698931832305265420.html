      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T10:45:47+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 10:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.soyacincau.com/author/alexwnl/" target="_blank">Alexander Wong</a></address>
      <p>The top of the line<a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2019/05/27/oppo-reno-10x-zoom-malaysia-launch-official-price/"> Oppo Reno 10X Zoom</a> is getting a high-spec variant in Malaysia next week. The new model will be released in conjunction with the opening of Oppo’s new flagship store at The Gardens Mall on the 30th November.</p>
      <p>According to Oppo, the new Reno 10X Zoom will come with 12GB of RAM while retaining a similar 256GB of storage. The rest of the hardware should remain unchanged and this includes a triple-camera setup that comes with a periscope telephoto lens. According to Oppo Malaysia, this is still a 4G LTE device and it doesn’t <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2019/07/26/oppo-reno-5g-malaysia/">support 5G</a>.</p>

      <p>We still don’t know the pricing for the RAM Reno 10X Zoom with 12GB RAM but we reckon it should be priced above RM3,000. The Reno 10X Zoom with 8GB RAM was originally launched in Malaysia at RM3,399 but the price is <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2019/11/11/oppo-reno-10x-zoom-malaysia-price-cut/">now reduced</a> to <a href="https://www.oppo.com.my/products/Reno-10x-Zoom/37">RM2,999</a>.</p>
      <p>To recap on the specs, the Reno 10X features a 6.6″ Full HD+ AMOLED display and it runs on a Snapdragon 855 processor. Its standout design is its shark-fin style 16MP f/2.0 pop-up selfie camera.</p>
