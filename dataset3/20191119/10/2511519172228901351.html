      <h1>Four Weddings and a Funeral: Andie MacDowell defends ‘beautiful’ rain scene regularly voted worst in history</h1>
      <h2>‘Is it raining? I hadn’t noticed’</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T10:29:48+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 10:29</time> by <a rel="author">Adam White</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/andie-macdowell">Andie MacDowell</a> has said that she never understood complaints about the infamous rain scene at the end of 1994’s <i><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/four-weddings-and-a-funeral">Four Weddings and a Funeral</a></i>.</p>
      <p>The scene, which features a climactic kiss in the pouring rain between MacDowell’s Carrie and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/HughGrant">Hugh Grant</a>’s Charlie, is capped by Carrie asking, “Is it raining? I hadn’t noticed."</p>
      <p>It has often been voted one of the worst lines of dialogue in film history.</p>
      <p>“Honestly, I really don’t get why the rain scene is regarded as such a big deal,” MacDowell told <i><a href="https://www.awin1.com/awclick.php?mid=5795&amp;id=201309&amp;p=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/19/how-we-made-four-weddings-and-a-funeral-andie-macdowell-mike-newell">The Guardian</a></i>. “It’s beautiful and we were freezing filming it.”</p>
      <p>“But I imagine even Richard is surprised that that one line has got so much attention,” she continued, referencing the film’s screenwriter <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/RichardCurtis">Richard Curtis</a>.</p>
      <p>“When the film came out there were absolutely no complaints, everybody loved it. The complaints and comments all happened years later.”</p>
      <p>Made on a shoestring budget of £3m, <i>Four Weddings and a Funeral</i> became one of 1994’s biggest hits, ultimately grossing $245m worldwide and turning Hugh Grant into a global star.</p>
      <p>It was this year rebooted for television by actor and producer <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/mindy-kaling">Mindy Kaling</a>, with <i>Game of Thrones</i> actor Nathalie Emmanuel starring in the lead role.</p>
      <p>In its review,<i> <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/reviews/four-weddings-and-a-funeral-tv-reboot-review-richard-curtis-classic-mindy-kaling-a9030241.html">The Independent</a></i> said that it “looks back tenderly at the original but doesn’t try to imitate it.”</p>
