      <p><a href="https://www.loudersound.com/reviews/luke-morley-to-our-punters-thunder-is-their-football-team">Thunder</a> have revealed that they’ll head out on a UK arena tour next year.</p>
      <p>The band will play a total of five shows, kicking off at Cardiff’s Motorpoint Arena on November 19 and wrapping up with a set at the First Direct Arena in Leeds on November 28.</p>
      <p>It’ll be the first time the band have played a series of electric headline shows in the country since 2017, with Danny Bowes, Luke Morley, Ben Matthews, Chris Childs and Harry James joined by special guests <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-story-of-ugly-kid-joe">Ugly Kid Joe</a>.</p>
      <p>Frontman Bowes says “After <i>Please Remain Seated</i> and <a href="https://www.loudersound.com/reviews/thunders-greatest-hits-file-next-to-bad-company-thin-lizzy-and-ufo"><i>The Greatest Hits</i></a> releases this year, work on the next studio album is already under way. We’ll get it out before these five shows. </p>
      <p>“I’m chuffed to report that it’s all new tunes, and it’s all rock. The setlist will be a mix of the new album and fan favourites, so it’s going to be a bit of a job working out which tunes we’ll play. I think I’ll leave it to Luke to sort that one out!”</p>
      <p>While Ugly Kid Joe will be special guests for all five shows, Thunder have also revealed that they’ll choose a different opening act for each night, with details to be announced in due course.</p>
      <p>General tickets will go on sale this coming Friday (November 22) from 10am GMT.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.loudersound.com/news/thunder-announce-2019-uk-christmas-shows">Thunder are currently gearing up for two UK Christmas shows</a> that’ll take place at Birmingham’s O2 Academy on December 20 and at the Manchester Academy on December 21.</p>
