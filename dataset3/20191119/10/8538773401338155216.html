      <p>An amateur mixed martial arts fighter has died in England after suffering a brain injury during a match.</p>
      <p>Saeideh Aletaha, 26, was competing at a Fast and Furious Fight Series (FFS) event in Southampton's Central Hall on Saturday when she was critically injured.</p>
      <p>She was taken to hospital following the fight, but died later.</p>
      <p>Hampshire Police said it was making inquiries into what happened.</p>
      <p>In a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/FFfightseries/">statement on Facebook</a>, FFS said: "All competitors get in prepared that they may be injured, and this is something not expected to happen 99.9% of the time.</p>
      <p>"But it can, and in this we make the environment as safe as possible with pre and post medicals from a doctor, and full medical cover throughout, with doctor, paramedic and ambulance on site alongside our experienced team of staff."</p>
      <p>FFS added its team included "numerous first aiders" and said it had not "skimped" on safety in any of its 19 shows.</p>
      <p>Fellow martial artists and friends paid tribute to Aletaha on FFS' Facebook page and that of Exile Gym, where the 26-year-old trained.</p>
      <p>A statement on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/exilegym.southampton.5/">Exile's page</a> read: "Saeideh Aletaha was a lovely character with a beautiful soul. Her dedication to the sport was 110% [and she traveled] miles every day just to train.</p>
      <p>"She found her place with us just a few months ago, but has become a part of the family and will be sorely missed. This news comes as a devastating blow to us all at the gym and the whole community."</p>
