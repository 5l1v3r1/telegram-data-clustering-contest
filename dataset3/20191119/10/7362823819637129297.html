      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba/sacramento-kings">Sacramento</a> guard Buddy Hield has been fined $25,000 by the NBA for kicking the ball into the stands following the Kings’ victory over <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/nba/boston-celtics">Boston</a>.</p>
      <p>The ball bounced toward midcourt after Marcus Smart’s potential winning shot bounced off the rim Sunday. Hield chased it down and <a href="http://www.nba.com/video/2019/11/18/bbops-celtics-vs-kings-20191117">kicked it into the crowd</a>.</p>
      <p>The penalty was announced Monday by Kiki VanDeWeghe, the NBA’s executive vice president of basketball operations.</p>
      <p>Hield scored a season-high 35 points in Sacramento’s 100-99 victory that snapped the Celtics’ 10-game winning streak.</p>
