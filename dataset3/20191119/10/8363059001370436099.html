      <p>There's also a free Amazon Echo Dot to be had if you splash out on Hive Active Heating.</p>
      <p>Hive's <a href="https://www.hivehome.com/products">sale is on now</a> and includes up to 25 per cent off heating, accessories, smart plugs, sensors, bulbs, Hive Hub and Hive Home Security packs. If you want to be able to control everything in your house via an App, then it's worth swinging by the site during its Black Friday sale because there are bargains galore to be had.</p>
      <p>You can get started with <a href="https://www.hivehome.com/plans/hive-welcome-home-plan">Hive's Welcome Home Plan</a> which will get you started with two Hive Active Light bulbs, a Hive Motion Sensor, a Hive Plug, and a Hive Hub, down from £129 to £103.20. There's also the <a href="https://www.hivehome.com/plans/hive-warm-welcome-home-plan">Warm Welcome Home Plan</a> -which immediately sounds more appealing. This package includes everything from the (presumably cold) Welcome Home Plan, as well as Hive Active Heating, plus you get a free Amazon Echo Dot (third gen), all for £339, down from £271.20.</p>
      <p>You can also pick up smaller components like the <a href="https://www.hivehome.com/products/hive-radiator-valve?icid=mname%3Amega-menu.iname%3Ahive-radiator-valve">Hive Radiator Valve</a>, <a href="https://www.hivehome.com/products/hive-light-smart-e14-bulb-dimmable-warm-white?icid=mname%3Amega-menu.iname%3Ahive-light-dimmable-smart-e14-bulb">Hive Light Dimmable Smart Bulbs</a>, and the <a href="https://www.hivehome.com/products/hive-active-plug?icid=mname%3Amega-menu.iname%3Ahive-active-plug">Hive Active Plug</a>, which sounds great for the more absent-minded, letting you double check if you turned your shit off - like your hair straighteners - so you don't have to worry about accidentally burning the house down.</p>
      <p>The sale is live until Monday, December 2, so there's plenty of time to peruse at your leisure, and don't forget to nip over to our <a href="https://www.gizmodo.co.uk/tag/black-friday">Black Friday hub</a> for more deals.</p>
