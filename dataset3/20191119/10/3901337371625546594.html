      <p>Mogakolodi ‘Tsotso’ Ngele received a lifeline with a rare appearance on the field in the Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers.  </p>
      <p>Ngele, who joined Black Leopards this season after parting ways with Mamelodi Sundowns, has struggled for game-time at the Limpopo outfit. </p>

      <p>The 29-year-old has made only one appearance for Lidoda Duvha this season under the team’s former coach Lionel Soccoia.</p>

      <p>Against Algeria on Monday night, Ngele almost scored when he was given a run in coach Adel Amrouche’s team at Botswana National Stadium.</p>
      <p>The former Platinum Stars and SuperSport United player will hope to have done enough to impress coach Luc Eymael at Leopards on his return to the club after the FIFA international break.  </p>
