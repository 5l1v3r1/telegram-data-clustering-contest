      <p>A coastguard spokesman said: "On arrival police had a visual of the casualty in the water but soon after lost sight.</p>
      <p>“A search began and several targets were identified which the helicopters were tasked to investigate.</p>
      <p>"Soon after <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/portishead">Portishead</a> RNLI arrived in the area and was able to locate the casualty and remove them conscious and breathing from the freezing water.”</p>
      <p>When Portishead RNLI arrived on the scene, crew were directed to the last reported sighting of the casualty with the help of local fishermen.</p>

      <p>They located the man who was, by then, struggling to keep afloat in the water.</p>
      <p>One of the crew then jumped into the water and grabbed the man, pulling him onto the boat.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Portishead RNLI said: “The crew were quick to spot the casualty who was now struggling to keep afloat in the very cold water.</p>
      <p>“With literally seconds to spare one crew member entered the water to grab the casualty before they went under for the last time.</p>
      <p>“The RNLI crew were then able to bring the casualty on board the Lifeboat where they were checked thoroughly for any injuries and administer lifesaving first aid.</p>

      <p>"Being very cold the volunteers wrapped up the casualty to try and start to warm them up.”</p>
      <p>The man was then airlifted to hospital by the coastguard helicopter for further treatment.</p>
      <p>The spokesman added: “This shows that the endless hours of training pays off.</p>
      <p>"Also big thanks to the fishing vessel who was also nearby helping to locate the person.”</p>
