      <p>“Gimme Summn,” one of the tracks from the new <i>II</i> EP, is a pretty straightforward track, as these things go. It’s a hard, squelchy, catchy banger. But the video is something else.

The computer animation is knowingly crude, and the whole thing seems designed to make you feel extremely bad if you’re even a tiny bit high. The legacy of those great old Aphex Twin videos lives on.
