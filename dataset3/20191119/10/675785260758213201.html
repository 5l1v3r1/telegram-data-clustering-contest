      <h2>The Queen's decision to pull the BBC documentary about the Royal Family because it was "too intrusive" features in season three of The Crown</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T10:08:41+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 10:08</time> by <a rel="author">Zoe Forsey, https://www.facebook.com/zoeforseymirror/</a></address>
      <p>Back in the 1960s the Queen welcomed cameras into her home to film a behind-the-scenes documentary about her family, giving an unprecedented insight into their private lives.</p>
      <p>The film crew spent 18 months following the Monarch, Prince Philip and their children getting clips of them doing day-to-day things like chatting at the breakfast table and relaxing in their living room.</p>
      <p>Richard Cawston's two hour documentary 'Royal Family' aired on the BBC on June 21, 1969, with 37 million viewers settling down to watch.</p>
      <p>But shortly afterwards the Queen changed her mind, deciding it was too "too intrusive" and ordered for the film to be kept hidden in the BBC vaults.</p>
      <p>And it wasn't just the Queen who wasn't happy with the footage.</p>

      <p>Princess Anne also turned her nose up, later admitting: "I never liked the idea of 'Royal Family', I thought it was a rotten idea.</p>
      <p>"The attention which had been brought upon one ever since one was a child, you just didn't need any more."</p>
      <p>The decision to pull the footage features in season three of The Crown, where Olivia Colman plays the Queen.</p>
      <p>Michael Bradsell, the film's editor, revealed he was initially hesitant about sharing his work with Her Majesty.</p>
      <p>"We were all a little bit nervous of showing it to the Queen because we had no idea what she would make of it," he told Smithsonian Channel, who uploaded a clip of the documentary on YouTube.</p>

      <p>"She was a little critical of the film in the sense she thought it was too long, but Dick Cawston, the director, persuaded her two hours was not a minute too long."</p>
      <p>ABC's The Story of the Royals focused on the documentary, and a number of experts debated why the footage was banished.</p>
      <p>Ryal biographer Hugo Vickers said: "Some people say that this would open the floodgates, and therefore after that all the sort of tabloid interest in them [would come after].</p>
      <p>"They would want to know more, and more, and more."</p>

      <p>Robert Lacey, historical consultant on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/netflix">Netflix</a> show The Crown, explained: "They realised that if they did something like that too often, they would cheapen themselves, letting the magic seep out."</p>
      <p>Snippets of the film have been released for special occasions, including Prince Philip's 90th birthday and the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. The Queen also allowed the National Portrait Gallery to play a small clip.</p>
      <p>"Legend has it that the Queen doesn't want parts of it to be shown," explained the National Portrait Gallery's Paul Moorhouse.</p>
      <p>"Regrettably, the film hasn't been seen for a long time. It just disappeared. There is a reluctance for this to be revisited."</p>
