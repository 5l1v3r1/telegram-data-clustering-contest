      <p>Line Of Duty has confirmed that Kelly Macdonald has been added to the cast just<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/line-dutys-jed-mercurio-hypes-season-6-teasing-guest-star-arrivals-11124570/"> days after Jed Mercurio teased guest arrivals</a>.</p>
      <p>The infamous Trainspotting actress, who’s also starred in State Of Play, Boardwalk <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/empire-tv-series/">Empire</a> and more recently The Victim, will play Detective Chief Inspector Joanne Davidson, the senior investigating officer of an unsolved murder.</p>
      <p>Joanne’s unconventional conduct raises suspicions at AC-12 and no will no doubt have Vicky McClure, Martin Compston and Adrian Dunbar’s characters trying to uncover whatever it is she’s up to.</p>
      <p>‘We’re honoured that Kelly Macdonald will join Martin, Vicky and Adrian in series six of Line of Duty,’ Jed enthused. ‘DCI Joanne Davidson will prove the most enigmatic adversary AC-12 have ever faced.’</p>
      <p>CEO and Creative Director of World Productions Simon Heath, added: ‘The Line of Duty team have always been huge fans of her work, so we’re thrilled Kelly has agreed to join us this series to pit her wits against AC-12.’</p>
