      <p><b>COLUMBUS, OhioÂ (AP)</b> - Ohio's Supreme Court has rejected Toledo's motion to dismiss a challenge to how the city handles appeals of citations related to camera-captured traffic violations.</p>
      <p>The high court recently rejected the motion to dismiss a challenge by Susan Magsig, of Woodville.</p>
      <p>The Toledo Blade reports Magsig received a citation alleging a camera held by a police officer caught her vehicle traveling 75 mph in a 60 mph-zone. Magsig argues Toledo violates state law by considering such appeals through an administrative hearing rather than through municipal court.</p>
      <p>The city argues the case shouldn't continue because a lower court's preliminary ruling prevents enforcement of a state law giving local courts jurisdiction over all traffic violations. Magsig's attorney says she isn't bound by that ruling involving a legal dispute between the city and state.</p>
