      <h1>Paris Saint-Germain owners 'closing in on Leeds United takeover'</h1>
      <h2>Qatar Sports Investments (QSI), the Qatari investment company that owns <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/psg/"><b>Paris Saint-Germain</b></a>, has reportedly entered an advanced stage of talks regarding the takeover of <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/leeds-united/"><b>Leeds United</b></a>.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T10:54:59+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 10:54</time> by <a rel="author">Leo Nieboer</a></address>
      <p>Despite facing competition from other bidders, QSI are considered strong favourites to complete the deal due to the organisation's relationship with current Leeds owner <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/andrea-radrizzani/"><b>Andrea Radrizzani</b></a>.</p>
      <p>The latter has a long-standing friendship with QSI and PSG president <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/nasser-al-khelaifi/"><b>Nasser Al-Khelaifi</b></a>, with the pair both working together in the past.</p>
      <p>According to <i>ESPN</i>, more talks are scheduled for the next few weeks but the Qatari company is expected to eventually assume a takeover of the Yorkshire club.</p>
      <p>Leeds already have several links with the Middle East country, such as a partnership with Aspire, a highly modern football academy based in Doha.</p>
      <p>The Championship side, who have not been in the top flight since 2004, came agonisingly close to promotion last season, <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/leeds-united/championship-promotion-race/live-commentary/live-commentary-leeds-vs-derby_358706.html">losing out in the playoffs</a> to Derby County.</p>
