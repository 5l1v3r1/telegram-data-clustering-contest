      <p>Twenty-four soldiers have been killed in an attack by militants in eastern Mali, the country's army has said.</p>
      <p>Another 29 were also injured during a joint operation between troops from Mali and Niger in the Gao border region.</p>
      <p>Mali's army said 17 "terrorists" were killed and 100 suspects were being held in Tiloa, in Niger.</p>
      <p>It comes weeks after 54 troops were killed in another attack - one of the deadliest in the past decade.</p>
      <p>Details of Monday's attack are unclear, and authorities have not identified what group the assailants belonged to.</p>
      <p>Security forces have been struggling to contain the threat from Islamist groups, some of which are linked to the so-called Islamic State or al-Qaeda. In recent months, Mali's military has abandoned several outposts.</p>
      <p>Islamist violence has also spread to other countries in the region, fueled by ethnic tensions.</p>
      <p>According to the UN, more than 1,500 civilians have been killed in Mali and Burkina Faso since January, with millions more in need of humanitarian assistance.</p>
      <p>A 15,00-strong UN peacekeeping force is currently stationed in Mali.</p>
