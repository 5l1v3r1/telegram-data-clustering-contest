      <h2>The pet was strapped into a bike-style dog trailer</h2>

      <p>Plymouth people were howling at the idea of a dog 'cycling' behind its owner on a busy Plymouth road after an amusing photo was shared online.</p>
      <p>While you may be barking mad if you think pets can actually cycle, the puparazzi - a local resident - spotted the cute doggy on a wheeled bike trailer near North Cross roundabout in Plymouth last night.</p>
      <p>Plymstock lady Becky Cooke shared the image, which Plymouth Live has received permission to post, and said: "Had to look twice...good job I wasn't driving as I thought for a minute it was Santa and his reindeer"</p>
      <p>"But seriously? What on Earth! This poor dog strapped in and taken on a busy road. Tbf [to be fair], he looked like he was having a fab time but [I've] never seen anything like it," she added.</p>
      <p>Local residents were divided, with some laughing at the dog and suggesting he enjoys the journey, while others were worried about the cyclist's lack of protective gear - and the impact this could have on the pet.</p>
      <p>One resident said: "[I] see this guy everywhere! That dog does love it!"</p>
      <p>Another agreed: "Dog was loving it!"</p>
      <p>But another local asked: "Where's his helmet [and] hi-vis or reflective gear?"</p>
      <p>"By not making himself more visible he puts the dog in more danger," she added.</p>
