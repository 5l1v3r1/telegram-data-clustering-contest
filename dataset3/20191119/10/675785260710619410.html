      <h2>McDonald's has unveiled its brand new 2019 Christmas menu - and it involves the return of the Big Tasty, camembert cheese dippers and even a new chicken burger called the Chicken Deluxe</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T10:04:59+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 10:04</time> by <a rel="author">Molly Holt, https://www.facebook.com/mollyjaholt/</a></address>
      <p>The cold weather might be here, but so is a brand new <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/mcdonalds">McDonald's</a> menu - including the return of some very popular old favourites.</p>
      <p>Loyal fans of the fast food chain will be pleased to hear that the beloved Big Tasty is back, after a year long absence from the famous restaurant.</p>
      <p>Featuring a beef burger, Emmental cheese, tomato, lettuce, onion and its statement smoky Big Tasty sauce, it costs £4.29 on its own, or £5.89 as a medium meal. Plus, you can also add bacon to it for an extra 40p.</p>
      <p>As well as the Big Tasty, there's also a brand new chicken burger set to appear this year, dubbed the Chicken Deluxe, for £5.19 (or £6.59 as a meal), as well as camembert cheese dippers (£1.69 for five, or £4.40 for a sharebox).</p>

      <p>Originally reported by <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/money/10369379/mcdonalds-christmas-menu-2019-big-tasty-camembert-cheese-dippers/">The Sun,</a> all the new additions will arrive in McDonald's stores tomorrow, on Wednesday 20 November.</p>
      <p>Despite being part of their festive menu, there's not much Christmassy about the new Chicken Deluxe burger, which involves two pieces of crispy chicken with a zesty tomato relish, cool mayo, cheese, lettuce and red onion rings.</p>

      <p>As for the cheese shareboxes, you get 15 gloriously gooey cheese bites as well as three dips, making them perfect for sharing.</p>
      <p>Once you've finished devouring all the new savoury offerings, you can wash it all down with a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/mcdonalds-bringing-back-mint-matchmaker-20826561">matchmaker McFlurry</a> to finish, costing 99p for the mini version, or £1.39 for standard.</p>
