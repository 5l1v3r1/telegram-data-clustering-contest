      <p>Whatâ€™s happened to boba? Has the trend gone, vanished, disappeared? Or is it waiting to make a comeback? Remember how at one point, almost every franchise was joining the bubble tea wagon â€“ except this extremely popular household name? You know what Iâ€™m talking about. Itâ€™s gold, has arches, and its mascot may be a relative of Pennywise.</p>

      <p>Thatâ€™s right!! McDonaldâ€™s has just announced their new bubble tea float, which will be on sale till 14th January 2020. Before you get too excited, itâ€™s McDonaldâ€™s Thailand, but we can definitely hope and pray that it gets released in Malaysia. For now, letâ€™s just marvel at this beauty, shall we?</p>

      <p>Their Brown Bubble Tea comes in 16oz cups, and it combines the rich taste of milk tea with brown sugar and Mekdiâ€™s alternative to tapioca, konjac pearls! This is definitely a healthier option as konjac has been recognised to have medicinal properties.</p>

        <i>DISCLAIMER: EVEN IF IT HAS MEDICINAL PROPERTIES, It DOESNâ€™T MEAN YOU CAN HAVE AS MANY AS YOU WANT!</i>
