      <p>Four Nigerian soldiers were among those who held up the sign in the days leading up to the election in February. The picture of the soldiers drew the ire of many Nigerians who felt they should be apolitical and hold allegiance to Nigeria and not the president.</p>
      <p>The Nigerian Army said it was aware of what the soldiers but ” dissociate itself from the pictures of the four armed men dressed in military camouflage doing a 4-by-4 fingers sign connoting a campaign symbol of a political party.”</p>
      <p>On November 15, Senator Dino Melaye posted the same picture to his Twitter handle. But he claimed the soldiers were supporters of Kogi State, Governor Yahaya Bello.</p>
      <p>“Bello’s fake soldiaers (sic),” he said in the caption accompanying the picture.</p>
      <p>Bello, a member of the APC and an ally of Buhari, has used the 4+4 sign at his campaign on many occasions.</p>
      <p>But the soldiers, whose pictures Melaye posted, were clearly not his supporters. A reverse image search showed that the picture was used by a number of publications including, BBC Pidgin, Channels and Daily Post in February.</p>
