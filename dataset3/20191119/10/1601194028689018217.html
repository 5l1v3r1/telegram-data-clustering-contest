      <p>Misbah-ul-Haq says Pakistan's pace attack must hit Steve Smith's "blind spot" if they are to prevent Australia's "batting genius" from piling on the runs in the two-match Test series.</p>
      <p>Smith averaged an astonishing 110.57 in a drawn Ashes series in England on his return to the Test stage after serving a one-year ban for his part in the Newlands ball-tampering scandal.</p>
      <p>The former captain will be the prized scalp for Pakistan when they attempt to secure a first series win in Australia in the longest format.</p>
      <p>Misbah wants to see his formidable fast bowlers frustrate the top-ranked Test batsman in the world when the series gets under way at the Gabba on Thursday.</p>

      <p>The Pakistan head coach said: "As far as Steve Smith goes, there's a blind spot for every top batsman in the world; as a bowler you're always interested in pitching the ball there.</p>

      <p>"It's important that we bowl with consistency there. Our bowlers are executing the plans very well right now, and hopefully we'll be able to build that kind of a pressure and stay disciplined, especially early in the innings.</p>
      <p>"No matter how good a batsman is batting, it's about consistency and bowling the maximum balls in those areas that build pressure and the batsman respects you, and you force him to make a mistake.</p>
      <p>"All the batsmen you talk to, any batsman in the world, that's the area where you have to defend a ball, and that is a six-to-eight-metre spot where you have to play the top of off stump.</p>
      <p>"That's the area from where if it's happening then that creates a great chance. Even if it's not happening, you have less chances to do anything with the ball.</p>
      <p>"It's about consistency, and top players in the world, if you miss those areas, that special length and line, then they are good enough to just cash in on that.</p>
      <p>"You have to be very, very disciplined, just keep the ball there, and if it's happening you are already in the game."</p>
      <p>The former Pakistan captain added: "The kind of form he is in, there's no doubt Steve Smith is a batting genius. We will try our best to execute our plans and dismiss him."</p>
      <p>Key Opta facts</p>
      <p>- Pakistan have lost their last two multi-game bilateral Test series, they have not lost more consecutive series in the format since losing all three they competed in across 2007.</p>
      <p>- Pat Cummins' tally of 87 Test wickets is more than any other bowler has taken since the start of 2018.</p>
      <p>- Australia are undefeated in their last 30 Tests at the Gabba - winning 23 of those matches. Their last defeat at the Brisbane venue was against West Indies in 1988.</p>
