      <p>Seven Worlds, One Planet’s South America episode has led to the BBC apologising for a series of errors where noises were edited onto the wrong animals.</p>
      <p>The episode, which originally aired on 10 November on BBC One, was called out by experts over certain scenes that aired but didn’t match up.</p>
      <p>After hearing the complaints, the BBC have now released a statement apologising as the show is re-edited to get the right animal sounds.</p>
      <p>When approached by <b>Metro.co.uk</b>, a BBC Spokesperson said: ‘Occasionally it is necessary to add supplementary audio to complement what’s captured, when there is background noise or when filming a significant distance from the animal.</p>
      <p>‘This is not unusual in any natural history programme making, but in the South America episode some incorrect audio has been used for a bird sequence and a scene involving an Andean bear.</p>

      <p>‘A snail kite was also mistakenly identified as a caracara.</p>
      <p>‘We apologise for these errors and they will be corrected for future versions.’</p>

      <p>Currently, the original version remains on BBC iPlayer, while the corrected version is being made.</p>
      <p>Dr Alexander Lees, a senior biodiversity lecturer at Manchester Metropolitan University, was one of the first to go public with the errors.</p>
      <p>Telling <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/please-retweet-bbc-got-animal-noises-mixed-up-in-david-attenboroughs-one-planet-5kjlzrg8b#">The Times</a> the BBC ‘needed to pull their socks up’, they said: ‘It’s a case of giving people the honest truth about what’s going on.</p>
      <p>‘The red-legged seriema is this big, crane-like thing which is nicknamed ‘the voice of Brazil’. It makes a beautiful wailing sound that is instantly recognisable to several million people living in Brazil. It never occurs on that side of the continent.’</p>
