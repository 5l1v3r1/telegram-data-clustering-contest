      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/michelle-visage/">Michelle Visage</a> has debunked speculations that she stormed off the set of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/strictly-come-dancing/">Strictly Come Dancing</a> after her elimination this weekend.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/rupauls-drag-race/">RuPaul’s Drag Race</a> judge had danced a couple’s choice dance to Vogue by Madonna but ended up in the bottom two alongside Saffron Barker.</p>
      <p>After a dance-off, the judges unanimously agreed to save Saffron, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/strictly-come-dancing-fans-gutted-michelle-visage-eliminated-facing-saffron-barker-dance-off-11172457/">sending Michelle home</a>.</p>
      <p>But the 51 year-old told <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/lorraine-kelly/">Lorraine Kelly</a> this morning that reports she had stormed off after her axing were unfounded to say the least.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘Storm out of where?’ she asked. ‘They said I stormed out of actual Blackpool. Did I go into the ocean – where did I go?’</p>
      <p>The former girl group singer admitted that instead of throwing a strop, she went to the after party – where partied on with her fellow competitors until the early hours of the morning.</p>
      <p>‘I actually went to the party until 3.30am in the morning,’ Michelle told Lorraine. ‘[I] was dancing all night with Neil [Jones] and Alex [Scott] and Oti [Mabuse] and Kelvin [Fletcher] and Giovanni [Pernice]. We were just having a really good time.’</p>

      <p>It seems that even after her elimination, Michelle is sticking to her guns about her dance, which showcased the voguing that grew out of the drag balls in Harlem in the 60s.</p>
      <p>Viewers were fuming on Saturday night when it appeared <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/strictly-come-dancing-viewers-fume-as-craig-revel-horwood-mansplains-voguing-to-actual-michelle-visage-11168773/">judge Craig Revel Horwood had ‘mansplained’ how to vogue to…the actual Michelle Visage</a>.</p>
      <p>She dedicated her performance to the queer community, who ‘raised’ her in the ball culture as a young woman.</p>

      <p>‘It felt like I knew that I did the right thing,’ Michelle confirmed. ‘It was amazing and something [viewers] have never seen. I know a lot of people are trying to say it wasn’t dancing, it was walking and posing but if they do their research they will find out it is, indeed, a dance.</p>

      <p>‘It’s the history of voguing but it was my history, it was where I grew up. It was a little nod to my history.’</p>
      <p>Michelle had previously defended her dance routine <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/michelle-visage-tears-strictly-takes-two-gets-fierce-defend-routine-11177952/">with a tearful appearence on Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two</a>.</p>
