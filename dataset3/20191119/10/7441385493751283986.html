      <h1>Food label laws: Are standards high enough for consumer safety?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T10:35:56+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 10:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/author/stephhazlegreaves/" target="_blank">Steph Hazlegreaves</a></address>
      <h3>“The importance of clearly labelling pre-packed foods to guard against allergic reactions is vital” says the owner and creator of Enjoy!</h3>
      <p>During the last five years, there has been a 72% rise in hospital admissions of children suffering severe <a href="https://www.openaccessgovernment.org/allergy-sufferers-at-risk/63790/">allergic reactions</a>, it was revealed this week. <a href="https://www.nhs.uk/">NHS</a> figures show that 1,746 children were treated for anaphylactic shock in 2018-19, up from 1,015 in 2013-14.</p>
      <p>Chris Crutchley is unable to eat a number of food-types himself due to various intolerances, which is the reason he launched the brand of chocolate.</p>
      <p>“The labelling on food products needs to clearly show the ingredients used; these figures show just how serious it can be if there is any doubt,” said Chris.</p>
      <p>“I know from first-hand experience how difficult it can be to walk into a shop and work out what you can and can’t eat. While I don’t have allergies, I can only imagine how much more concerning unclear labelling must be for those who have severe reactions if they eat or even come into contact with the wrong thing.</p>
      <p>“That is why it is so important for things to be clearly labelled – not just in the small print, but as a significant feature of the packaging.</p>
      <p>“Our packaging clearly states what ingredients are used, and if anything is added beyond the base ingredients we state exactly what has been added.”</p>
      <p>In September the <a href="https://www.food.gov.uk/">Food Standards Agency</a> announced a new law, coming into effect from October 2021, which will require businesses to provide full ingredient and allergen labelling on foods which are pre-packed for direct sale.</p>
      <p>The change in the law is the result of a UK-wide consultation following the tragic death of teenager Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, as a result of an allergic reaction to a baguette she had eaten which did not display allergen information on the packaging.</p>
      <p>“I 100% back this change in law and I commend the efforts of the campaign to make food producers realise the importance of informing people about what they are eating,” said Chris.</p>
      <p>“I’m glad this issue is now at the forefront of people’s minds and no longer an afterthought.”</p>
