      <h1>Inside Takealot’s upgraded warehouse and distribution centre</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T10:29:04+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 10:29</time> by <a rel="author">Sibahle Malinga</a></address>
      <p>SA’s largest online store, Takealot.com, has expanded its Johannesburg-based warehouse and distribution centre (DC), to enable it to store almost four million items and scale to roughly 10 000 boxes leaving the warehouse every hour.</p>
      <p>Launched in June 2011, the shopping site has rapidly evolved over the years, opening warehouses throughout the country, expanding its selection to over 21 departments, creating a third-party sellers’ marketplace, and most recently, adding pickup points across the country.</p>
      <p>As the company prepares for what it calls the “biggest Black Friday yet”, it has strengthened its DC visibility and tracking technologies, to enable it to ship one order every second.</p>
      <p>The company has also increased its Johannesburg DC staff to around 750, while up-scaling its contact centre agents from 380 to over 700.</p>
      <p>The local online retailer, which has over 1.8 million customers, has three large warehouses, based in Cape Town, KwaZulu-Natal and Johannesburg, and has several branches throughout the country, which handle orders for Takealot.com and its sister company, online fashion store<a href="https://superbalist.com/">Superbalist.com</a>.</p>
      <p>Kim Reid, Takealot CEO, told the media during a tour of the warehouse yesterday that the expansion is a culmination of months of tech and operational business-wide focus, to prepare for increased predicted traffic and shopper volumes on Black Friday and beyond.</p>

      <p>“After expanding our Johannesburg DC, our warehouse storage space now stands at 75 000m2. We house over 3.7 million items at any given time, and have opened 47 Takealot Pick-up Points in all provinces.</p>
      <p>“The Takealot delivery team delivers to more South African homes than any other courier company in the country. On a monthly basis, we carry out over 1.6 million deliveries, with this number expected to increase to over two million during the festive shopping season.”</p>
      <p>Around 80% of the ordered items are already available on the warehouse shelves; the rest are ordered and bought from distributors as the orders come in.</p>

      <p>Through the recent expansion and upgrade, the orders have been streamlined to ensure a seamless process takes place between the DC’s receiving depot, storage of items on shelves, boxing and packaging, and classifying orders according to their delivery destination.</p>
      <p>Conveyor belts are systematically used to track the items and ensure the correct classification of items, before the collection trucks arrive.</p>

      <p>More than 4 500 drivers deliver for the Takealot delivery team; a number the company says is growing every month. The Takealot group anticipates they’ll travel over 4 000 000km while delivering orders from Black Friday until 24 December.</p>
      <p>Takealot trucks collect the orders and distribute them to the local branches. From the branches, they are either taken to the collection points or delivered direct to the customer.</p>
