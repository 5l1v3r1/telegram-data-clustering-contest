      <p>Law&amp;Crime adds a new podcast series to its growing lineup, “Real Impeachment with Ross Garber,” hosted by renowned U.S. impeachment attorney, <b>Ross Garber</b>. The first episode of the non-partisan Impeachment-focused series is available beginning today.</p>
      <p>Garber, a prominent impeachment attorney known for representing high-profile Republican officials such as Gov. <b>Mark Sanford</b> of South Carolina, Gov. <b>Robert Bentley</b> of Alabama, and Gov. <b>Eric Greitens</b> of Missouri, will host “Real Impeachment with Ross Garber.” In each episode, Garber, also a CNN legal analyst, will navigate listeners through the current Presidential impeachment proceedings by leading frank discussions with top experts in an unbiased format. Garber aims to help listeners gain an understanding of what’s really going on in the impeachment process by providing a practical breakdown of events and fostering “real talk” with luminary guests working in areas of the law, government, and media.</p>
      <p>The first episode launched today with Garber joined by <b>Alan Baron</b>, who was counsel for the House in four impeachment cases, three of which he also litigated before the Senate.</p>
      <p>“Impeachments are rare events in U.S. history. I’m thrilled to join with Law&amp;Crime to bring listeners in-depth discussions that will help demystify the process and players,” said Garber.</p>
      <p>“We are excited to have Ross on board for this podcast because he is a total straight shooter, and there is no better expert on impeachment,” Law&amp;Crime President <b>Rachel Stockman</b> said. “He will be able to give listeners a sense of what’s really going on in the process without all the partisan politics.”</p>
