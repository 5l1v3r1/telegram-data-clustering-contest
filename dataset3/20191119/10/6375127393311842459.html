      <h1>Ejay appeals to millennial viewers</h1>

      <h3>EJAY Falcon feels honored to be part of the historical musical, “Damaso”, that opens in theaters this Wednesday. Loosely based on Jose Rizal’s, immortal novel, “Noli Me Tangere”, he plays the iconic role of Elias, the good friend of Crisostomo Ibarra played by newcomer Jin Macapagal.</h3>
      <p>“Sana, maraming kabataan ang manood ng ‘Damaso’ kasi maganda ang mensahe nito, lalo na para sa millennials,” he says. “I admit na sa panahon natin ngayon, mas gusto ng young generation of viewers ang mga romantic comedies pero sana, bigyan naman nila ng chance ang ganitong movie na nagpapakita sa ating history. Kasi the movie shows na kung ano 'yung mga nangyari noong araw sa mga kababayan natin, actually, nangyayari pa rin ngayon sa present situation, so we have to do something about it alang-alang sa ating bayan at para sa ating kapwa Pilipino.”</p>
      <p>He is also happy to be given the chance to sing in the movie since “Damaso” is a musical with 16 original songs.</p>
      <p>“Nakakatuwa kasi dito ko pala maipapakitang may kakayahan ako sa pagkanta,” he beams. “In fairness sa songs composed by our writer-director, si Joven Tan, ang gaganda ng songs sa ‘Damaso’ and they all carry an important message na bagay sa bawat character na kumakanta nito.”</p>
      <p>Doing the movie is really a big challenge for him. “Kasi mahirap 'yung kumakanta at uma-acting ka at the same time,” he explains. “Challenge din 'yung malalalim na Tagalog words na ginamit namin sa mga linya ng dialogue. Tagalog naman talaga ang salita namin sa Mindoro pero nanibago pa rin akong bigkasin ang Tagalog words na gamit noong panahon ni Jose Rizal. Bawal ang adlib kay Direk Joven Tan. You have to follow the script strictly para hindi mabago ang tone and flavor ng movie.”</p>
      <p>With regard to his lovelife, Ejay is very open about his relationship with Starstruck discovery Jana Roxas.  They just came from a vacation in Osaka and Tokyo, Japan.</p>
      <p>“Traveling abroad is very important for us kasi mas diyan namin nakikilala ang isa’t isa,” he says. “Ang sarap mamasyal sa ibang lugar with your loved one.”</p>
      <p>So do we hear wedding bells ringing for them soon? “We’ve talked about it but as of now, hindi muna. Sobrang busy sa dami ng ginagawa ko and we don’t want to be pressured dahil lang maraming friends namin ang nag-aasawa. It will come at the right time kapag pareho na kaming ready.”</p>
      <p>Ejay is also an endorser of Rei Anicoche Tan’s Beautederm and he was present at the blessing of Sylvia Sanchez’ Beautederm store and at the re-launch of Anthony Taberna’s Ka Tunying Panlasang Makabayan restaurants.</p>
