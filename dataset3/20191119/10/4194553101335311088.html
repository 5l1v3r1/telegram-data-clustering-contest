      <h1>Pochettino on brink of Spurs sack with situation compared to Jurgen Klopp’s BVB exit</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T10:13:44+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 10:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/jordanchamberlain/" target="_blank">Jordan Chamberlain</a></address>
      <p>Mauricio Pochettino is likely to be exiting Spurs following talks with Daniel Levy as ‘players at the club brace themselves for a managerial change,’ write Matt Law and John Percy in the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/18/mauricio-pochettino-holds-crisis-talks-daniel-levy-tottenhams/">Telegraph</a>.</p>
      <p>The Argentine lost to Liverpool in the Champions League Final at the end of last season and the two clubs have gone in dramatically different directions since.</p>
      <p>Liverpool are unbeaten and eight points clear at the top of the Premier League, while Poch’s Spurs sit in 14th, just six points above the relegation zone.</p>
      <p>According to the report, Pochettino’s situation is similar to Jurgen Klopp’s final campaign in Germany in which Dortmund performed horribly in the league and despite mutual love between manager and fans – parting ways was the only sensible thing to do.</p>
      <p>
        <b>“Another source compared the situation at Tottenham to what happened at Borussia Dortmund, when Jurgen Klopp asked to be released from his contract, although the German did see out the 2014/15 season,” they write.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Klopp got the best out of his BVB players for six years and was over-performed in all competitions – winning two Bundesliga titles and reaching a Champions League Final.</p>
      <p>But in 2014/15 it seemed that he and definitely his players had run out of steam and it appears the same has happened with Spurs.</p>
      <p>There is no way they’ll fight for the title this season and can arguably not even be considered a competitive rival right now.</p>
      <p>While Liverpool continue to thrive, another one bites the dust.</p>
