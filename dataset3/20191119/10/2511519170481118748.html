      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/marie-kondo">Marie Kondo</a>, who achieved global fame for her tidying and decluttering method, has opened an online homeware store.</p>
      <p>The Japanese tidying guru <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/marie-kondo-netflix-tidy-up-konmari-method-clean-organise-a8709976.html">advocated the ‘KonMari’ method</a> of removing everything that doesn’t “spark joy” from your home, discarding items which have either outlived their purpose making sure you "thank them" for their service.</p>
      <p>This approach (which also saw Kondo teach people everything from how to correctly fold socks to <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/marie-kondo-how-to-pack-a-suitcase-folding-shirts-clothes-travel-space-save-a8723101.html">organising your suitcase</a> and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/marie-kondo-makeup-konmari-beauty-products-allure-magazine-interview-a8794881.html">makeup bag</a>) became synonymous with minimalism and a paired-back approach to decorating. </p>
      <p>It was so popular that Kondo was given a book deal, <i>‘The Life Changing Magic Of Tidying Up’</i> and her own <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/marie-kondo-netflix-tidying-up-konmari-method-reaction-interview-a8722541.html">Netflix show ‘Tidying Up with Marie Kondo’</a>.</p>
      <p>But it seems Kondo was actually playing the long game and now wants us all to replace the stuff we threw out with items from her curated online store.</p>
      <p>The website, <a href="https://shop.konmari.com/collections">Konmari.com</a>, has several different categories of product including decor and living, tidying and organisation, tabletop and entertaining, cooking and kitchen, bath essentials, aromatherapy and books. </p>
      <p>Items include a brass incense holder for $40 (£31), a linen kimono robe for $115 (£89), a shiatsu stick for $12 (£9), a matcha whisk for $30 (£23) and a $200 (£155) tea container. </p>
      <p>In a message posted on the website, Kondo says: “The goal of tidying is to make room for meaningful objects, people and experiences.</p>
      <p>"I can think of no greater happiness in life than being surrounded only by the things I love.” </p>
      <p>On another page, she says her method was never about “getting rid of things”. </p>
      <p>She explained: “It’s about heightening your sensitivity to what brings you joy. Once you’ve completed your tidying there is room to welcome meaningful objects, people and experiences into your life."</p>
      <p>The store was launched weeks after Rakuten, Japan’s biggest e-commerce site announced a commercial partnership with Kondo.</p>
      <p>In a comment to the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/marie-kondo-adds-an-e-commerce-shop-to-her-site-11574053200">Wall Street Journal</a> Kondo contests the idea that she’s encouraging people to replace items she told them to throw away.</p>
      <p>“What’s most important to me is that you surround yourself with items that spark joy, if the bowl you’re currently using sparks joy, I don’t encourage replacing it at all.”</p>
      <p>But Twitter wasn’t buying it. One user said: “Marie Kondo is a genius hustler. Convince everyone to throw out their useless homewares, sell them some new useless homewares.”</p>
