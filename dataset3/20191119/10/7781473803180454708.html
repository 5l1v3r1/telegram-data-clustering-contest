      <p>MG Motor India is launching the <a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/mg/zs-ev-m812/">MG ZS EV</a> in a phased manner across the country. The electric SUV will be unveiled on December 5 with a launch sometime in January. The firm will start slow with the ZS EV, and launch the electric SUV in five cities, to begin with. But there will be fast-charging support in these cities. MG is partnering with Fortum to install 50kW CCS/CHAdeMO DC fast charging stations across MG's showrooms in five cities including Delhi NCR, Hyderabad, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Ahmedabad this year to begin with.</p>

      <p>Once there is greater acceptance, infrastructure and a trained dealer network, the EV will be launched in more cities. The <a href="http://overdrive.in/cars/mg/hector-m758/">MG Hector</a>'s strong demand has put it on a tight production schedule. This will not affect the ZS EV, The two cars are independent programmes which have been built on separate lines. The SUV is being brought in as a CKD.</p>
