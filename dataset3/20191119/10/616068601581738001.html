      <p>Britain’s Prince Andrew is facing further disgrace as charitable backers begin to distance themselves from him amid unfavourable fallout of an interview on his friendship with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>Britain’s Press Association is reporting that professional services provider KPMG, a sponsor of his flagship entrepreneur project, Pitch@Palace, won’t renew its support. Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, another backer of the project, says it is reviewing its three-year partnership, which is due to expire at the end of the year.</p>
      <p>Andrew, the second son of Queen Elizabeth II, tried to end years of speculation about his role in the Epstein scandal by granting a no-holds barred interview to the BBC's Newsnight program on Saturday.</p>
      <p>The strategy backfired when the prince failed to show empathy for the young women exploited by Epstein.</p>
