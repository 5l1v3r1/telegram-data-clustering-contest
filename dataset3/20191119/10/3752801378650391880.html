      <p>A 10-year-old boy was killed in KwaZulu-Natal when a taxi hit him during his walk to school, a paramedic services official said on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The incident occurred near the R102 in Hambanathi, at the Tongaat intersection, according to IPSS spokesperson Paul Herbst.</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately, the child was declared dead due to the extent of his injuries."</p>
      <p>Herbst said that the driver of the taxi had to stop a few metres away from the scene, "due to the public wanting to assault the driver".</p>
      <p>"However, police and other services are now on [the] scene," he added.</p>
