      <p>Construction has finished for Tokyo's National Stadium, set to be the centerpiece of next year's Olympic Games, the site's owners said Tuesday.<br/><br/>The Japan Sport Council said the last bit of construction was completed Thursday with just the final quality and safety checks remaining before the stadium opens next month.<br/><br/>It will be officially unveiled on Dec. 21, with the Emperor's Cup soccer final being the first sporting event to be held there on New Year's Day.<br/><br/>Completed at a cost of more than $1.25 billion, the stadium, which can accommodate 60,000, will also host athletic and soccer events during the games.<br/><br/>Construction started in December 2016, about 14 months later than planned, after the original design was scrapped because of public outcry over spiraling costs.<br/><br/>The delay meant the stadium could not host matches of the Rugby World Cup, as originally planned.<br/><br/>The National Stadium is one of eight new venues to be used at the Tokyo games. All of them are either completed or scheduled to be finished before the event.<br/><br/>The Tokyo Olympics will run from July 24 to Aug. 9.</p>
