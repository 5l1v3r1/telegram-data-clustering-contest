      <p>While Bernice searches for the perfect gift, daughter <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/soaps/emmerdale/emmerdale-spoilers-dee-dee-to-return-for-mum-bernices-exit/">Dee Dee reveals she has already got her wedding present for the bride and groom sorted</a>... and her gift is going to be the fact she is sticking around in the village and starting at the local school.</p>
      <p>Bernice is thrilled to have her daughter back at home where she belongs and is overwhelmed by the gesture, but it also gives her good for thought when it comes to her own gift for Liam.</p>
