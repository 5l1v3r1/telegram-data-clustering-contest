      <h1>Gold Technical Analysis: Once again fails near $1475 level, previous support-turned-resistance</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T10:23:37+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 10:23</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/haresh-menghani" target="_blank">Haresh Menghani</a></address>

          <b>Erases the previous session’s modest uptick amid fading safe-haven demand.</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Bearish traders might aim towards testing monthly lows, around 1445 level.</b>

      <p><a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/markets/commodities/metals/gold">Gold</a> failed to capitalize on its early uptick to over one-week tops and once again started retreating from the $1475 <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance">resistance</a> zone. Currently hovering around the $1466 region, the commodity has now erased all of the previous session's modest intraday gains.<br/> <br/>The mentioned barrier represents a previous horizontal support breakpoint and the lower end of a one-month-old trading range, which is closely followed by 100-day SMA and should act as a key pivotal point for the commodity's next leg of a directional move.<br/> <br/>Meanwhile, technical <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/indicators">indicators</a> on the daily chart maintained their bearish bias and have again started gaining negative momentum on hourly charts, supporting prospects for a further near-term depreciating move amid fading safe-haven demand.<br/> <br/>Hence, some follow-through weakness back towards $1455 horizontal support en-route last week’s swing lows, around the $1445 region, now looks a distinct possibility. The latter coincides with 38.2% <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance/fibonacci">Fibonacci</a> level of the $1265-$1557 bullish move, which if broken might pave the way for a further depreciating move.<br/> <br/>Below the mentioned support, the commodity is likely to accelerate the slide further towards $1432-30 intermediate support before eventually dropping to the next major support near the $1414-12 region – 50% Fibo. level.<br/> <br/>On the flip side, the $1475 region might continue to act as an immediate strong resistance, which if cleared decisively might trigger a bout of short-covering and lift the commodity back towards the $1490 region ahead of the key $1500 psychological mark.</p>
