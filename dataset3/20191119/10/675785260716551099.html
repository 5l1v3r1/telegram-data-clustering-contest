      <h2>David Barnett was sentenced to death when he was convicted of brutally murdering his grandparents but speaking to I Am A Killer he claims he has no memory of the murder</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T10:55:38+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 10:55</time> by <a rel="author">Jane Lavender, https://www.facebook.com/dailymirror/</a></address>
      <p>Pensioners Clifford and Leona Barnett were found in a pool of their own blood having been stabbed more than 20 times in a brutal killing in their own home.</p>
      <p>But it was no intruder who had sadistically killed the elderly couple - it was their own grandson, David Barnett.</p>
      <p>Barnett, who was sentenced to death for the murders, used five different knives to ensure both Leona and Clifford were dead.</p>
      <p>He calmly walked into his grandparents home while the God-fearing couple were at a church service at the nearby Kirkwood Baptist Church.</p>
      <p>Barnett even fell asleep while watching TV on the sofa as he lay in wait for his unsuspecting grandparents to return home.</p>

      <p> </p>
      <p>But the orgy of violence that followed when they returned home at 1pm was anything but calm.</p>
      <p>First, Barnett shoved his grandmother down the hall and shoved his grandfather to the floor and grabbed a knife.</p>
      <p>He stabbed Clifford 10 times in his face neck and head before he was satisfied he was dead.</p>
      <p>Barnett then turned his attention to his grandmother.</p>
      <p>He grabbed another two knives and stabbed her 12 times on the neck and face.</p>
      <p>The attack was so savage several of the knives used to stab them to death, snapped.</p>

        <figcaption>Leona and Clifford Barnett were his adoptive grandparents</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Certain they were both dead, Barnett the hid one of the knives under a mattress, washed the blood off his hands, pulled the blinds in the house and took the cars keys and money from his grandmother's purse and fled the house.</p>
      <p>Police arrested Barnett the following morning when they found the victims' car in a residential area.</p>
      <p>He immediately confessed to the murders and was sentenced to death.</p>
      <p>For years, Barnett refused to say why he had carried out the seemingly senseless crimes.</p>
      <p>But now, in Crime+Investigation's I Am A Killer, he has revealed the appalling abuse he says he suffered at the hands of his adopted father, their son, John Barnett.</p>
      <p>Barnett had a troubled upbringing from the moment he was born.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article20881068.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_David-Barnett.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>David says he was sexually abused by his adoptive father when he was still a child</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>His mother rejected him and he lived with a man who beat him, molested him and showed him no love.</p>
      <p>Barnett said: "I had to find my own food, I wasn't washed. I was like a stuffed toy kept on the shelf. I was alone."</p>
      <p>When he was five, Barnett was taken into care and by the time he was seven he was living with Rita Reames and her family - and finally had to love a little boy needs.</p>
      <p>But then Rita was given the chance to study abroad and because Barnett was her foster son was unable to take him with her.</p>
      <p>He said: "I thought I had done something wrong. I thought they were getting rid of me because I hadn't done something right."</p>
      <p>Back in the care system, Barnett went to live with John Barnett when he was eight.</p>
      <p>It wasn't long before the computer teacher adopted the little boy.</p>

        <figcaption>John became Barnett's adoptive father when he was eight</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Barnett said: "I was ecstatic. That was one of the happiest days of my whole childhood."</p>
      <p>Within just a few months Barnett says he began to notice things were going very wrong.</p>
      <p>He said: "He had high expectations and he would hit me if I didn't meet them. But then he would comfort me by hugging me and kissing my ears.</p>
      <p>"He would touch me inappropriately and I started to black out when I was sitting on his lap. I felt numb and I wanted to die."</p>
      <p>Then John adopted two more boys, with the youngest, Eric, becoming the focus of his attention.</p>
      <p>Barnett said: "I was the oldest and I was supposed to protect them but I was also glad because it wasn't happening to me any more."</p>

        <figcaption>The house Barnett moved into</figcaption>

      <p>The three boys and John lived on the same street as their grandparents, Clifford and Leona.</p>
      <p>While Barnett adored his grandmother he couldn't separate Clifford from his son.</p>
      <p>Then, when he was 15, Barnett and his friend, Jason Kingdon, claim they found a photo in John's bedside cabinet of him holding a young boys genitals.</p>
      <p>They took it straight to the police but Jason says their concerns were dismissed.</p>
      <p>Then John fostered a fourth child, Secil Shodroski, who had been having a hard time at home.</p>
      <p>While she says she didn't see John abusing the boys physically or sexually, she has her own harrowing story.</p>
      <p>Secil explained: "He would wait for the boys to go to sleep and he would rub me and touch me. I thought it was OK because I loved him but I was just a little girl.</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Secil also lived in this house and was abused by John</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>"He was a paedophile and a predator."</p>
      <p>Secil was also growing close to Barnett as the pair spent more time together and they became a couple.</p>
      <p>She fell pregnant with their son, Seth, and the couple set up home.</p>
      <p>Secil said: "David was so proud of Seth, he wanted to hold and feed him all the time."</p>
      <p>But as a young man, Barnett was often out late with his friends and Secil couldn't cope.</p>
      <p>She said: "I didn't know how to handle it and I know I pushed him away, which hurt him because people had been pushing him away his whole life."</p>
      <p>Less than a year later, Barnett had stabbed his grandparents to death.</p>
      <p>He finally confided in Jason that he had gone to Clifford and Leona's home that day to tell them about the abuse he had suffered at the hands of their son.</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Barnett finally confided in his best friend, Jason</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Jason said: "He wanted them to know what John was doing and he told them everything.</p>
      <p>"They were hurt and offended and didn't want to hear it."</p>
      <p>To this day, Barnett says he can't remember what happened as he stabbed his grandparents to death.</p>
      <p>He explained: "I remember the beginning and the result was horrifying. There isn't a day that goes by when I don't think of them, they live in my heart.</p>
      <p>"I think Leona would give be a hug and forgive me, so would Clifford."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>At Barnett's trial, no details emerged about the abuse he had suffered and John has never been prosecuted.</p>
      <p>But his death sentence was taken on by a legal team who were adamant his harrowing story should be heard.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Barnett's death sentence was reduced to life without parole.</p>
      <p>And he hopes one day that he will be allowed to apply for parole and live a normal life.</p>
      <p>He said: "I believe I deserve to be where I am and that I deserve that situation and am blessed to have it.</p>
      <p>"The more support I had the more I was willing to live. I believe I will be out and hopefully I can be a productive member of society."</p>
      <p>Amazingly, he also has no anger towards the adoptive father who caused him so much pain when he was a child and who died in 2017.</p>
      <p>Barnett said: "I don't hate John, I still love him for what he tried to do. He had his own problems that he couldn't overcome."</p>
