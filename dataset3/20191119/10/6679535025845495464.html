      <p>‘Weaves’, a textile fair to be held in Erode from November 27 to 30, is looking at attracting a large number of overseas buyers. Over 60 foreign visitors and representatives of several multi-national companies that have offices in India are expected to visit the second edition of the event.</p>
      <p>“We have conducted road shows across the country and met officials in other countries. Only when we get more foreign buyers will the quality of the products (made here) go up,” said C. Devarajan, vice chairman of Texvalley. The aim of the exhibition is to showcase the capabilities of the textile industry in this region to national and global buyers, he added. “We expect a total of 10,000 visitors.”</p>
      <p>The second edition of ‘Weaves’ is expected to generate nearly ₹1,000 crore in business enquiries as against ₹400 crore last year. Texvalley, a permanent market place in Erode for the textile sector, has 750 permanent stalls.</p>
      <p>The participants at the expo will include griege (unprocessed) fabric manufacturers, made-up and garment producers, traders, and weavers, and also about 30 handloom weavers. It will have seminars on all four days. Visitors can book bulk orders and participants will have the capacity to cater to these orders. The venue will have lounges for business-to-business meetings as well.</p>
      <p>Texvalley offers a host of services to its occupiers and members such as helping them modernise looms, cluster development, training in packing and displaying products, etc. The aim is to offer all the solutions required, such as banking, insurance, product development, etc, to those who have permanent stalls in Texvalley. The number of occupants has gone up from 350 during the same period last year to 750 now.</p>
      <p>“We are looking at about 900 occupants. We help weavers add value to their products,” said Mr. Devarajan.</p>
