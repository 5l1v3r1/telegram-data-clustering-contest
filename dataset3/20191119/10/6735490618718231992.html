      <p>Fallon went on: “Tom Cruise will send you a cake during the holidays,” as Smulders confirmed it was always a white chocolate coconut cake, insisting she kept it in the freezer until March and just chipped away at it.</p>
      <p>She joked, “I receive it, and hopefully, maybe if I talk about it on television I will for sure receive it. But it’s so good.</p>
      <p>“It’s so good. I don’t know why. I’m not even a big sweets person, but it’s so good.”</p>
