      <h1>Personal injuries committee to examine insurance industry in Ireland</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T10:35:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 10:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>A personal injuries committee made up of judges has been selected to examine the insurance industry in Ireland.</p>
      <p>The announcement was made this morning by Chief Justice Frank Clarke at an insurance fraud conference in Dublin.</p>
      <p>It comes amid ongoing criticism over the level of compensation payouts in Ireland.</p>
      <p>Mr Justice Clarke says the committee will get to work straight away, despite not being formally established by law.</p>
      <p>"One of the issues that they will have to consider is bench-marking Irish damages," he said adding that this would be done by referencing damages in other countries including, but not limited to, the UK.</p>
      <p>"If they were to wait until they are formally established before commencing that process, that would take time.</p>
      <p>"But there is no reason why the process of putting in place that research, cannot start straight away," Mr Justice Clark added.</p>
      <p>Last month a senior judge claimed the insurance industry in Ireland is <a href="https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/insurance-group-rejects-claim-industry-is-fundamentally-dishonest-960386.html">“fundamentally dishonest”</a>.</p>
      <p>In a report in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> Mr Justice Kevin Cross said that Ireland’s ‘compo culture’ and fraudulent claims are responsible for a rise in insurance premiums.</p>
      <p>This assertion was rejected by Insurance Ireland.</p>
