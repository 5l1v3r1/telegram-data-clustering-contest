      <p>A coal mine explosion killed 15 people in north China’s Shanxi province, state media reported Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Nine other people were injured by the gas explosion on Monday afternoon, which took place in a mine owned by Shanxi Pingyao Fengyan Coal &amp; Coke Group Co, according to official news agency<i> Xinhua</i>.</p>
      <p><i>Xinhua</i> reported that 35 miners were working underground when the blast happened, but 11 miners were able to escape.</p>
      <p>The injured miners were in a stable condition, Xinhua said.</p>
      <p>Shen Xuping, an official at the Shanxi Administration of Coal Mine Safety, said Tuesday that the accident revealed a “lack of awareness of the rule of law and chaotic management” by the company involved, local media reported.</p>
      <p>Shen said the accident was caused by activity that “broke the law and regulations,” although authorities are still investigating the exact cause.</p>
      <p>Deadly mining accidents are common in China, where the industry has a poor safety record.</p>
      <p>At a meeting last week, the State Council — China’s cabinet — ordered a “special crackdown on production-related safety issues” to “further improve workplace safety”, Xinhua reported.</p>
      <p>In December 2018, seven miners were killed in southwestern Chongqing municipality after the connecting segment of a mining skip broke and fell down a mine shaft.</p>
      <p>In October the same year, 21 miners died in eastern Shandong province after pressure inside a mine caused rocks to fracture and break, blocking the tunnel and trapping the workers.</p>
      <p>Only one miner was rescued alive.</p>
      <p>In December 2016, explosions in two separate coal mines in the Inner Mongolia region and in northeastern Heilongjiang province killed at least 59 people.</p>
