      <p>I mean it's not <i>officially</i> <i>Half-Life 3</i>, but this might be as close as we get.</p>
      <p>Valve announced on Twitter just now the existence of their flagship VR game, <i>Half-Life: Alyx</i>. Alyx is obviously one of the main protagonists from <i>Half-Life 2</i>, so this is an obvious continuation of the series that fans have been screaming for.</p>
