      <p>Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat offered to pardon a man who claims to know the mastermind behind the murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia.</p>
      <p>In a statement Tuesday, Muscat said: "This person has the necessary guarantees that if it collaborates with the police, and all the information and evidence will be enough to arrest the mastermind of this case, then this person will be granted a presidential pardon." He added that he was "solely responsible for this decision."</p>
      <p>The man in question was arrested on Thursday during a raid that targeted an alleged money laundering ring. The arrests involved local police and Europol.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://timesofmalta.com/articles/view/daphne-murder-middleman-seeks-pardon-to-name-mastermind.750880">Times of Malta</a>, the arrested man claims he can link the person suspected of commissioning the murder of Caruana Galizia to those who carried out the killing, as well as those who helped provide the explosive device used.</p>
      <p>Three men — brothers Alfred and George Degiorgio and Vince Muscat — have been <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/three-charged-murder-of-daphne-caruana-galizia/">charged with the murder</a>. They have all pleaded not guilty.</p>
