      <p>The Frenchman is expected to leave Old Trafford at the end of the 2019-20 season after telling reporters in June that he wanted a "<a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/transfer-talk/news/paul-pogba-wants-to-leave-man-united_354414.html">new challenge".</a></p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/transfer-talk/news/pogba-prefers-juventus-over-madrid_379871.html">Reports have suggested</a> that, despite interest from Real Madrid, Pogba's heart was set on a return to Turin.</p>
      <p>According to <i>Tuttosport</i>, Juventus plan to feel out United's stance on selling Pogba next summer when the two clubs meet over the next few weeks to discuss Mandzukic's January move to Manchester.</p>
      <p>It has been claimed that Mandzukic, who is surplus to requirements at Juventus, has already <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/man-utd/transfer-talk/news/man-utd-close-to-completing-mandzukic-deal_376843.html">agreed a deal in principle</a> with United ahead of the next window.</p>
      <p>Pogba, whose contract at United expires in 2021, enjoyed a successful four-year period at the Old Lady between 2012 and 2016, winning four consecutive Serie A titles and reaching the Champions League final.</p>
