      <h1>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order has an extremely dumb Order 66 Easter egg</h1>

      <p>As far as Easter eggs go, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order’s Order 66 callback has to be among the most bizarre.</p>
      <p>This story includes <b>minor spoilers</b> for Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order.</p>
      <p>Just from knowing where <b>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</b> takes place in the timeline, you can probably guess that Order 66 would be referenced in a few different ways.</p>
      <p>This is indeed the case for Fallen Order, but developer Respawn decided to throw in one extra mention in the most ridiculous way possible. Too out-there, in fact, I don’t even know how anyone could find this Easter egg on their own.</p>
      <p>Towards the beginning of Fallen Order’s story on Bracca, as you’re taking the train ride, Cal gets a vision and is compelled to follow his friend Prauf through the train. At one point, the door quickly shuts behind him.</p>
      <p>There, most people would turn to find themselves in the ship that is later revealed to be where Cal had been training before that business went down. However, if you don’t turn around and instead keep pressing the switch, you’ll get to hear Darth Sidious (Palpatine) say the magic words.</p>
      <p>You’ll need to do this 66 times, though, as YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVH6TnazTWF3KQTVug4905Q">Garbett</a> did. It’s pretty inconsequential, and very dumb, but you have to applaud the effort.</p>
