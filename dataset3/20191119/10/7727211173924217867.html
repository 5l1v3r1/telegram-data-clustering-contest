      <h1>Forget Akinfenwa, Wycombe’s set-piece specialist Joe Jacobson is the man Tranmere must stop in FA Cup replay</h1>
      <h2>Mellon's men will have to deal with Wycombe's main threat if they're to advance to the next round</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T10:28:43+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 10:28</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Cavilla</a></address>
      <p>Two Prenton Park visits, four Wycombe Wanderers goals—all of which involved the Chairboys’ left-back, Joe Jacobson.</p>
      <p>Talk about leaving a lasting impression. </p>
      <p>During the 2-2 draw between <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/tranmere-rovers-fc">Tranmere</a> and Gareth Ainsworth’s side in the FA Cup, Jacobson levelled the scoring with an expert free-kick that left Scott Davies flat-footed in goal. The experienced full-back later reinforced his quality from set-pieces as he delivered a teasing ball into the Tranmere box, which Alex Samuel attacked and subsequently scored from.</p>
      <p>And history repeated itself on Sunday afternoon, with Jacobson having a hand in both of his side’s two goals once again. </p>
      <p>He first teed up Adebayo Akinfenwa from a free-kick before sending in a dangerous cross from a corner, which ultimately won his side a penalty. The Cardiff-born defender stepped up to the spot and slotted past Davies once again.</p>
      <p>Much of Sunday’s pre-match talk had centred around the physical presence of Akinfenwa, but it’s Jacobson’s undoubted quality that Tranmere continued to be exploited by.</p>
      <p>And Rovers are not the first side this season to be on the receiving end of an inspired set-piece showing from the former Shrewsbury Town man.</p>
      <p>In September, Jacobson scored a remarkable hat-trick against Lincoln City, with all three strikes from dead ball situations.</p>
      <p>The first of his goals was a free-kick, while the two that followed were direct corners that beat Imps’ keeper Josh Vickers.</p>
      <p>At 33, Jacobson is one of Ainsworth’s oldest and most trusted players. Indeed, Sunday’s match at Prenton Park not only marked the defender’s birthday but also his 500th career appearance. He is a player who has been a consistent Football League performer, with this a trend showing no sign of changing anytime soon.</p>
      <p>It’s no coincidence that Wycombe have scored more league goals from dead ball situations than any other side in England’s top four tiers this season (15), with Jacobson contributing three crosses that led to goals in addition to scoring five of his own.</p>
      <p>Two of the six goals he has struck in all competitions this campaign have been penalties. And even with those taken out of the equation, that puts him level with Tranmere’s joint top-scorers this season, Connor Jennings and Stefan Payne (4).</p>
      <p>As the two sides prepare to lock horns for the third time in ten days, will lessons have been learned on this occasion?</p>
      <p>The winners of this FA Cup tie will face the lowest-ranked side left in round two of the competition, Chichester City, which will be broadcasted live on BT Sport on December 1.</p>
      <p>Micky Mellon’s men will be hoping to repeat their cup run of last season, and Jacobson could well be the deciding factor regarding whether or not that dream will become a reality.</p>
