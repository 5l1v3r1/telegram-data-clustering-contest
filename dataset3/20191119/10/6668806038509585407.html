      <p>After months of dodging the question around her rumoured relationship with actor Pulkit Samrat, actress Kriti Kharbanda has now confirmed that they are dating. The two, who star together in Anees Bazmee's Pagalpanti, have been in the news for their love affair for a while now. But while their public outings made fans ship the two, both Pulkit and Kriti dodged the main question and always laughed them off with witty answers.  </p>

      <p>In a recent interaction, Kriti finally admitted to being in a relationship with Pulkit Samrat. She said, "No, they are not rumours. We are dating each other. In all honesty, I wanted my parents to know first that I’m dating someone and when you start seeing someone, I think there’s a time for everything when you’re comfortable talking about it. Sometimes it can take five years; sometimes it can take five months. In our case, it was five months, but I’m in a very happy place and I have no qualms admitting that I am dating Pulkit Samrat."</p>
      <p>Apart from Kriti and Pulkit, Pagalpanti also stars John Abraham, Ileana D'Cruz, Anil Kapoor, Arshad Warsi, Urvashi Rautela and Saurabh Shukla in key roles. The film is slated to release on November 22 this year.</p>
