        <u>COURT</u>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>The Buganda Road Chief Magistrates’ Court has vowed to dismiss the case in which music promoter Andrew Mukasa aka Bajjo is accused of inciting violence.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Grade One Senior Magistrate, Stella Amabilis asserted on Monday that she will discharge Bajjo in the next hearing date of the case if the state fails to arraign witnesses that can pin him.</p>
      <p>“This is the last adjournment for this case; I will dismiss it if no witness is produced to this court, I, therefore, defer it to December 2, 2019, and the accused’s bail is extended till then,” ruled Amabilis.</p>
      <p>The ruling was prompted by the accused's lawyer, Erias Lukwago, who requested court to dismiss the case after the state prosecutor Miriam Njuki told court that she could not prosecute for the police file was missing from court.</p>
      <p>“I cannot proceed today, for I don’t have a police file to admit the facts of the case,” Njuki told court.</p>
      <p>It was then that Lukwago requested court to dismiss the case wondering how a police file went missing.</p>
      <p>“Your honour, my client spent some time in jail and getting bail was not that easy, we pray that you dismiss the case in the interest of justice.</p>
      <p>We agreed the last time that the state avails witnesses today, but the sad part of it is that even the police file is missing, yet the case has been on adjournments since June, purposely for the state to avail witnesses,” Lukwago said.</p>
      <p>This is what prompted the trial magistrate to adjourn the case for the last time pending dismissal if the state failed to adduce witnesses.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The charge</b>
      </p>
      <p>Prosecution alleges that during the month of June 2019 in various places such as Masaka, Mbarara, Ibanda, and Kampala, Bajjo incited members of the public to</p>
      <p>
        <b>Carrying out violence</b>
      </p>
      <p>In regard to offensive communication, the state alleges that Bajjo also in June this year with intent to disturb the peace and privacy of the president recorded a video and posted it on social media talking of overthrowing the government.</p>
      <p>According to prosecution, Bajjo allegedly used his mobile phone to make the suggestion with no purpose of legitimate communication.</p>
