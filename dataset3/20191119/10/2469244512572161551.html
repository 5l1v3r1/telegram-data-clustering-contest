      <h1>Hospital staff sickness due to stress, anxiety and depression is getting worse</h1>
      <h2>Concerns are being raised about the health and well being of hospital workers</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T10:17:03+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 10:17</time> by <a rel="author">Alice Cachia, Anita Merritt</a></address>
      <p>NHS staff across Devon hospitals took more than 110,000 days off work last year because of stress, anxiety and depression - and the situation is getting worse.</p>
      <p>New NHS figures have revealed in the 12 months to July 2019, staff took 385,277 full-time equivalent days off sick across trusts in Devon.</p>
      <p>A total of 111,637 of the sick days were because of anxiety, stress, depression, or other psychiatric illnesses. <br/>That works out as a rate of more than one in every four sick days, or 29 per cent.</p>
      <p>That was up from 26.1 per cent the year before, and 24.7 per cent in the year to July 2017, when comparable records began.</p>
      <p>Campaigners claim "massive" staff shortages mean more employees are working extra unpaid hours, contributing to the crisis.</p>
      <p>At Devon Partnership NHS Trust, more than one in every three sick days taken by NHS staff was because of mental health problems - 38.4 per cent - the highest rate in Devon.</p>
      <p>Dr John Puntis, consultant paediatrician and co-chair of the campaign group Keep Our NHS Public, said: “This is likely to reflect the huge pressures at work from trying to meet increased demand at the same time as coping with massive staff shortages and rising expectations.</p>
      <p>“This means inevitably that staff are doing extra hours, often without pay, and feeling compelled to come to work even when unwell.</p>

      <p>“People not feeling they have a voice, control or influence over their jobs, the unavailability of easily accessible mental health support, problems with bullying and harassment by managers, and not feeling cared for and appreciated in the workplace all contribute to psychological distress.</p>
      <p>“Staff absence creates a negative spiral that further increases the pressure on colleagues who are still at work, leading to more sickness.</p>
      <p>“There does need to be a more healthy and compassionate culture in the NHS - but this will be very difficult to achieve given 100,000 vacancies and all the others problems caused by years of underfunding.”</p>
      <p>Across England, there were 17.3 million days taken off sick by NHS staff in the year to July 2019.  A whopping 4.3 million of those, or almost one in four, were taken because of stress, anxiety, depression or other psychiatric illnesses.</p>
      <p>An NHS spokesperson said: “While the proportion of sickness absences in the health service attributed to mental health problems is lower than the country as a whole, we are committed to ensuring that all NHS employers take care of their staff, offering support, good occupational health, flexible working and a range of other measures.</p>
      <p>“Staff are the life blood of the NHS, and as outlined in our Long Term Plan we are already offering the most comprehensive national mental health support offer to doctors of any health system in the world, and are committed to doing similarly with other staff groups.”</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, the health secretary Matt Hancock announced plans to to provide better mental health and wellbeing support to NHS staff.</p>
      <p>The news came in response to recommendations from Health Education England following its report on the mental health and wellbeing of NHS staff and learners.</p>
      <p>At the time, Professor Ian Cumming, chief executive of Health Education England, said: “More support is needed for those who care and better care is needed for those studying to become healthcare professionals.</p>
      <p>“The mental wellbeing of staff contributes positively to patient care so we must get it right.</p>
      <p>“As a caring and compassionate organisation, the NHS attracts staff with these values, but it must be recognised that in giving care you also absorb some of the concerns and issues of the people that you are caring for." <br/> </p>
