      <p>Local councillor Anne-Marie McNally said the community is shocked at the news which comes just months after a man was shot multiple times in nearby Griffeen Glen Park.</p>
      <p>The Social Democrat told Dublin Live: "People are shocked and terrified. It's a very quiet estate, and everyone's very shaken.</p>
      <p>"It's still early in the investigation so we don't really know or completely understand what's going on.</p>
      <p>"Mount Andrew is your typical quiet estate, full of nice families. The area is a popular cut-through route from the bus stop off the N4. A lot of people would go through it.</p>

      <p>Councillor Andrew Moynihan also spoke of his horror describing violent crime as "unacceptable".</p>
      <p>He said: "Horrified to hear of a violent shooting in Mount Andrew.</p>
      <p>"This estate is home to many young families. Particularly violent crime like this is unacceptable, and we will not tolerate it in our community. Thinking of the victim and all those affected."</p>
