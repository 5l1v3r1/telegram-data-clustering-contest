      <p>Kamloops RCMP Cpl. Jodi Shelkie says the collision happened in a marked crosswalk at the intersection.</p>
      <p>"The victim was crossing in a marked crosswalk at the intersection of McGill Road and University Drive. The pickup truck was making a left hand turn on a green light."</p>
      <p>The driver stayed at the scene and was brought to the Kamloops RCMP detachment to further the investigation. Police closed nearby roads for several hours.</p>
