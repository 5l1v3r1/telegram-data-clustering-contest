      <p><b>TL;DR: </b>The pocket <a href="https://zdcs.link/nnP6j">BONDIC Pocket 3D Liquid Plastic Welding Kit</a> is on sale for $14.99, a 40% savings. </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>It's finally happened — your phone charger is down to it's last, sad frayed wire and you'll be forced to spend money on a new one in no time. You've already tried using tape to hold it together, but you know that's only a temporary fix. You need something stronger. </p>
      <p>Don't give up on your sad, worn down charger just yet — you can breathe new life into your weathered and broken electronics with <a href="https://zdcs.link/nnP6j">this liquid plastic welding kit.</a> The <a href="https://zdcs.link/nnP6j">BONDIC</a> pocket welder allows you to use liquid plastic to clean, fill, cure, or shape whatever you need, and it only hardens when you cure it with the included UV light, giving you total control of your repair experience. Lucky for you, it's on sale ahead of Black Friday for less than $13.</p>
      <p>Unlike glue, this far superior adhesive doesn't just work by sticking two flat surfaces together. Instead, <a href="https://zdcs.link/nnP6j">BONDIC</a> allows you to actually rebuild shapes and sizes, weld around objects, or even rebuild them entirely. You also get to decide when it's time for the plastic to harden — after you've created your shape or filled whatever needs to be filled, you can set and harden the plastic in just four seconds with the UV light. Once it's hardened, you can file, sand, drill, paint, or mold it as you need, taking your repair projects to the next level customization-wise. </p>
      <p>If you really want to treat yourself to something useful this Black Friday, ditch the glue and get the <a href="https://zdcs.link/nnP6j">BONDIC Pocket 3D Liquid Plastic Welding Kit instead for just $12.74</a> with code BFSAVE15. You can also pick up the pro kit, which comes with an extra tube of liquid plastic, for $19.12 with the same discount. </p>
