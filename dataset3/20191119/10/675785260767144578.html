      <h1>Andy Murray could be a canny 100/1 tip for SPOTY</h1>
      <h2>Odds and betting for BBC SPOTY 2019 and why Andy Murray might be a good outside tip</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T10:42:39+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 10:42</time> by <a rel="author">Dave Prentice</a></address>
      <p>Headingley Hero and World Cup winning talisman Ben Stokes is an unbackable <b><a href="https://play.thepools.com/sportsbook/SPECIALS/?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationwide&amp;utm_campaign=spoty">1/8</a> </b>to be named BBC Sports Personality of the Year in Aberdeen on Sunday, December 15.</p>
      <p>But it's a public vote, this year's show is in Scotland - and much stranger things have happened than a favourite failing to win the BBC award.</p>
      <p>So keep a very close eye on the new-look Davis Cup finals which started this week.</p>
      <p>Andy Murray, winner of the BBC prize in 2013, 2015 and 2016, has proved his enduring popularity with the British public.</p>
      <p>And he's  currently a huge <b><a href="https://play.thepools.com/sportsbook/SPECIALS/?utm_medium=inline-editorial&amp;utm_source=reach-nationwide&amp;utm_campaign=spoty">100/1 with thepools.com</a> </b>to claim a fourth SPOTY prize. <br/>But that could all change very quickly.</p>
      <p>Murray's 2015 SPOTY was built on his heroic performance in leading Great Britain to a first Davis Cup success in 75 years.</p>
      <p>Sure, he's been plagued by injury problems.</p>
      <p>But he's not a complete write-off, winning a Doubles title at Queen's last summer and winning on the ATP tour in Belgium last month.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>So let's look even more closely at the case for Sir Andy.</p>
      <p>Great Britain have been well served by the Davis Cup draw, which has thrown up a pair of winnable matches – the second is against Kazakhstan – in the group phase.</p>
      <p>GB are odds-on to win their group and around 20/1 to win the trophy outright.</p>
      <p>Andy's team-mates, Dan Evans and Kyle Edmund,  are in form and BBC voters like their tennis.</p>
      <p>SPOTY voters have chosen tennis players six times, only Formula One (Seven) and athletics (18) producing more.</p>
      <p>And the Davis Cup final finishes on Sunday November 24.</p>
      <p>While those images of Stokes' glorious summer are starting to fade, if Murray can produce miracles in Aberdeen they'll be fresh in viewers' minds.</p>
      <p>Of course Andy is 100/1 for a reason.</p>
      <p>But those odds could tumble in the weeks ahead. <br/> </p>
