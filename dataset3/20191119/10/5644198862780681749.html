      <p>WELLINGTON: A pro New Zealand basketball team are under heavy scrutiny due to off-court incidents that saw their top import sacked over an assault charge and a second player issue an apology following a report of disorderly behaviour on a flight home.</p>
      <p>The New Zealand Breakers, four-times champions in Australia's National Basketball League (NBL), stood down American shooting guard Glen Rice Junior indefinitely on Monday, less than two weeks after he was signed as a replacement player.</p>

      <p>Rice Jnr, the son of three-times NBA All Star Glen Rice, was arrested and charged with assault following an incident at an Auckland nightclub last Thursday and faces a court appearance on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>After initially backing Rice Jnr as "innocent until proven guilty", Breakers owner Matt Walsh said new information had come to light that required the 28-year-old former Georgia Tech basketballer be removed from the team.</p>
      <p>"Regardless of the outcome of Glenâ€™s court appearance, there is no denying he has let down the club, our fans and the New Zealand public after we gave him this lifeline," Walsh said in a statement on Monday.</p>
      <p>"I feel it is my duty to assist Glen in paying his accommodation, legal and medical costs while he remains in our country to settle his business.</p>
      <p>"But I also have no option but to remove him from the team."</p>
      <p>Hours after the announcement, local media reported that Breakers forward Tom Vodanovich was met at Auckland airport by police after a report of disorderly behaviour on a flight home from a game in Perth on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The New Zealand international was not charged but issued a public apology.</p>
      <p>"I am mortified to have embarrassed the club and myself on the flight," he said in a Breakers statement.</p>
      <p>"I am particularly upset to have contributed to the perception there is a bad culture at the club, when it absolutely is not the case."</p>
      <p>Owner Walsh was unable to attend the away game against the Perth Wildcats having been suspended for two games by the NBL for a verbal clash with Commissioner Jeremy Loeliger following the Breakers' defeat at South East Melbourne Phoenix on Nov. 9.</p>
