      <p>SD Tempest <a href="https://www.forces.net/news/hms-prince-wales-portsmouth-aircraft-make-first-visit">ensured the safe arrival of aircraft carrier HMS Prince of Wales into Portsmouth</a> at the weekend.</p>
      <p>The tug previously guided sister ship, HMS Queen Elizabeth, <a href="https://www.forces.net/news/navy/portsmouth-prepares-imminent-arrival-hms-queen-elizabeth">into the city's port for the first time</a> in August 2017.</p>
      <p>Her three powerful engines mean she is most capable tug in the Royal Navy and also has exceptional manoeuvrability.</p>
      <p>She is commissioned for the job as the giant size of the carriers require an extra-powerful tug.</p>
