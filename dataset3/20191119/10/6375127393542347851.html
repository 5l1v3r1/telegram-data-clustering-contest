      <h3>SEVENTEEN more members of the New People’s Army have surrendered to government authorities following negotiations with agents of the Philippine National Police Intelligence Group (PNP-IG) which has been going all-out to convince more leftist rebels to yield and avail of the Duterte government’s Enhanced Comprehensive Local Integration Program or E-CLIP program, the Journal Group learned yesterday.</h3>
      <p>“We are facilitating the surrender of NPA members in the countryside in support to President Duterte’s Executive Order 70 which is aimed at institutionalizing the ‘whole-of-nation approach’ in seeking an end to the decades-old communist insurgency,” said PNP-IG director, Brigadier General Edgar S. Monsalve.</p>
      <p>Last Friday, members of the Regional Intelligence Unit 5 convinced six Bicol-based NPA guerrillas to yield following a series of negotiations.   The six members of the Bicol Regional Party Committee were identified as Manilyn Danao alias ‘Ka Karen,’Julio Espinosa alias ‘Ka Joseph,’ Raul Romblon alias ‘Ka RJ,’ Victor Royo alias ‘Ka Tarzan,’ Cenon Villar alias ‘Ka Sabod’ and Fernando Romblon alias ‘Ka Pando.’</p>
      <p>The six turned over two caliber .38 revolvers and a home-made shotgun to the police.</p>
      <p>Three others identified as Ley Magentey alias ‘Ka Walad,’ Falodi Adam alias ‘Ka Kimay’ and Ma Bet Agol alias ‘Ka Britoy’ on the other hand yielded to Regional Intelligence 12 officers in Sitio Datal Lawa in Barangay Upper Sepaka in Surallah, South Cotabato.</p>
      <p>The three turned over one cal. .22 revolver and a Garand rifle with seven live ammunition to authorities.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, Monsalve said that officers from the Regional Intelligence Unit 3 facilitated the voluntary surrender of NPA members Jayson Sugguep alias ‘Ka Jay,’ Precilla Morales alias ‘Ka Donna’ and Eduardo Bautista alias ‘Ka Patrick’ at the Tarlac Police Provincial Office.</p>
      <p>The three also turned over one fragmentation grenade and two 40mm live ammunition to the police.</p>
      <p>On the same day,  NPA rebel Arnel Urbano alias ‘Ka Loida’ also yielded to RIU3 and local police operatives in Iba, Zambales. Urbano, a member of an NPA unit operating in Zambales and Bataan provinces surrendered a rifle-propelled grenade and one M-16 magazine with 10 live ammunition to the police.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, RIU3 operatives also paved the way for the surrender of Sammy Bawaa alias’ Ka Bunso’ and Eric Soria alias ‘Ka Elmo’ in Iba, Zambales. The two members of the NPA Guerrilla Intelligence or Paniktik Pwersa under the command of one ‘Ka Maggie’ of the NPA’s Komiteng Larangay Gerilya Tarlac-Zambales yielded one M-76 grenade and an improvised 12-gauge shotgun to the police.</p>
      <p>Carlito Deplano alias ‘Ka Rogie/Lucas/Rico’ also yielded to RIU3 officers in Gapan City in Nueva Ecija. He also surrendered a caliber .45 pistol with three live ammunition, a rifle grenade and an M-16 magazine to authorities.</p>
      <p>Deplano was described as a vice commander of an NPA unit under the rebels’ Central Luzon Regional Party Committee headed by Edgardo Friginal alias ‘Ka Elsie.’</p>
      <p>Another identified as Herminio Gawad Jr. alias ‘Ka Balbal/Halas’ surrendered to RIU10 officials in Cagayan de Oro City. Gawad, described as a member of the NPA’s Northern Mindanao Regional Committee turned over a rifle grenade to officials.</p>
      <p>All are now under the custody of the PNP-IG, Monsalve said.</p>
      <p>Monsalve said they are stepping-up their campaign against wanted NPA rebels and at the same time are embarking on a massive drive to convince majority of them to finally surrender and leave their mountain hideouts in order to live a normal life.</p>
      <p>Monsalve said that all PNP-IG Regional Intelligence Units have launched their full support to to the government’s E-CLIP to ensure that NPA members who plan to surrender to the government will have have a holistic package of benefits that they can avail of, such as livelihood assistance, medical assistance, education, housing, and legal assistance.</p>
