      <h1>2020 HR-V now available with Honda Sensing, will PH get it?</h1>
      <h2>US-spec Honda HR-V is now equipped with intelligent driver aids</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T10:52:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 10:52</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.autoindustriya.com/author/marcus-deguzman.html" target="_blank">Marcus De Guzman</a></address>
      <p>It was in August of last year when Honda Cars Philippines Inc. (HCPI) launched the refreshed HR-V for the local market. Available in either <a href="https://www.autoindustriya.com/car-reviews/2018-honda-hr-v-1-8-rs.html">1.8 RS</a> or <a href="https://www.autoindustriya.com/car-reviews/2019-honda-hr-v-1-8-e-cvt.html">1.8 E</a>, the HR-V, the sleek crossover gets a bolder Solid Wing Face design, redesigned LED headlights, a new sporty RS trim, along with plenty of new standard interior amenities.</p>

      <p>For 2020 however, the HR-V gets a much-needed upgrade courtesy of Honda Sensing. You read right, Honda's suite of intelligent safety features and driver aids have now made their way onto the US-spec models of the HR-V.</p>
      <p>This means features such as adaptive cruise control (ACC), collision mitigation braking system (CMBS) with forward collision warning (FCW), lane keeping assist system (LKAS), road departure mitigation (RDM), as well lane departure warning (LDW) are now available for the 2020 update. This makes the HR-V the most recent model from Honda to be equipped with active safety features.</p>

      <p>Aside from the safety upgrade, the US-spec 2020 HR-V also gets some new cabin features. These include: double-stitched leather seats, 8-way power-adjust for the driver's seat, and a new 7-inch touchscreen display. Like the PH-spec HR-V, the 2020 update still comes with the 1.8-liter SOHC i-VTEC inline-four. It puts out 141 PS with 174 Nm of torque and is mated to an Earth Dreams CVT.</p>

      <p>While it is good news that the HR-V is now available with intelligent driver aids, the bigger question is will Honda Sensing be available on the local versions of the HR-V soon? Fingers crossed HCPI will do so in the near future.</p>
