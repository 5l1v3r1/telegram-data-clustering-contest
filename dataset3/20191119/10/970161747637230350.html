      <p>And while discussing their marriage – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/im-celebrity-roman-kemp-reveals-george-michael-gatecrashed-dad-martins-first-date-mum-shirlie-11180122/">including how his godfather George Michael accompanied them on their first date</a> – he addressed his dad’s health issues, and how he had to help him remember some of the 80s band’s most famous songs following his battle with a brain tumour.</p>
      <p>Speaking to his fellow campmates Roman told them: ‘When [Spandau Ballet] went back out on tour post-brain tumour, he forgot everything. So I had to learn all those Spandau songs and re-taught them to him.</p>
      <p>‘How can my dad not be my hero for all of that?’</p>
      <p>Just what did happen to Martin Kemp? Here’s what you need to know…</p>

      <h3>When did Roman Kemp’s dad Martin have a brain tumour and what happened to him?</h3>
      <p>Martin Kemp was diagnosed with two benign brain tumours – one the size of a grapefruit – in 1995.</p>

      <p>The Spandau Ballet bassist and actor revealed on Piers Morgan’s Life Stories in 2014 that it was his wife who had discovered a lump in his head, discovering that there was a mass growing in the middle of his brain after he sought medical advice.</p>
      <p>‘If they’d never found this one growing out, they wouldn’t have found the one in the middle until it was too late, and that was the one that would have killed me,’ Martin explained.</p>
      <p>He underwent surgery to remove the tumours as well as having radiotherapy treatment.</p>

      <p>Although Martin recovered, he has been left with epilepsy as a result of the two tumours, which he controls with medication.</p>
      <p>‘Having epilepsy is quite common for anyone who has a brain tumour or is recovering from one,’ he previously explained.</p>
      <p>‘I still take drugs to suppress it and will have to do so for the rest of my life.’</p>
      <p>Martin resumed his acting career in 1998, and went on to play EastEnders bad boy Steve Owen – husband of recently departed Mel Owen (Tamzin Outhwaite) – for four years.</p>

      <h3>What is a benign brain tumour?</h3>

      <p>A benign brain tumour is a non-cancerous mass of cells which grows in the brain.</p>
      <p>Unlike a malignant (cancerous) tumour, benign tumours tend to grow slowly and not spread to other parts of the body – but they can also prove life-threatening if they are left untreated.</p>
      <p>Most can be safely removed with surgery and will not return if all of it can be removed – although if it can’t be completely removed there is a risk it could grow back.</p>
      <p>Symptoms of a brain tumour include new, persistent headaches – which are often worse first thing in the morning, persistent nausea and vomiting, vision problems, drowsiness and epileptic fits.</p>
      <p>All of the above can of course be caused by other conditions, but it’s always advisable to see your GP if you’re concerned.</p>
