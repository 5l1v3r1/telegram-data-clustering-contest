      <p>Make up your mind, Chris Evans – is Captain America going to make an appearance in <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/disney/">Disney</a>+’s The Falcon And The Winter Soldier or not?</p>
      <p>The actor’s famous Marvel Cinematic Universe character took what we assumed to be his final bow in April’s Endgame. However it hasn’t taken long for punters to predict he’ll make some sort of comeback in the series spinoff about Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) and Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan).</p>

      <p>Speaking about the potential of a return of Cap AKA Steve Rogers at a premiere for his latest film Knives Out, Chris was flip flopping all over the place.</p>
      <p>‘No, probably not,’ he mused, sombrely, at first <a href="https://www.etonline.com/chris-evans-on-whether-captain-america-will-appear-in-the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier-exclusive">to Entertainment Tonight.</a></p>
      <p>While it makes sense he wouldn’t be keen to step back into the cowl seeing as his story was wrapped up in a neat little package, and Sam now has the famous shield, he hadn’t closed the door entirely.</p>

      <p>He did admit that it would be a ‘shame’ to heave him back into the story just for the sake of it, though – which hampers those dreams.</p>

      <p>‘It was really tough. There was a million ways that whole tenure with Marvel could have gone wrong, and it didn’t!’ Chris continued. ‘So, to stick the landing so well, it would be a shame to revisit.’</p>
      <p>But (see, we told you he was flip flopping): ‘Unless there was something very unique that we felt the need to reveal.</p>
      <p>He added: ‘For now, it feels like, let’s just be content with how well it ended.’</p>
      <p>Hmm, okay, you’re not saying a lot but you’re also saying everything we need to hear, Chris.</p>
      <p>Disney+ has been a massive success for Marvel with its films and spinoffs finding a home on the streaming platform that recently launched.</p>
      <p>It launched in the US on the 12 November but will eventually land in the UK – as well as France, Germany, Spain and Italy – on 31 March 2020.</p>
