      <p>In one of the pivotal scenes in Martin Scorsese’s “The Irishman,” Jimmy Hoffa (played by Al Pacino) and his right-hand man, Frank Sheeran (Robert De Niro), are having a meeting in Florida with a Hoffa enemy, Anthony “Tony Pro” Provenzano (Stephen Graham). Accompanying the latter is Detroit gangster Anthony “Tony Jack” Giacalone. That actor playing Tony Jack?: It's Buffalo native Patrick Gallo.</p>
      <p>It’s another career highlight for Gallo, whose diverse credits include Ava DuVernay’s Netflix powerhouse “When They See Us,” HBO’s “Boardwalk Empire” and prime-time hits like “ER” and “Cold Case.” He has regularly worked as a writer and director.</p>
      <p>Through it all, Buffalo has remained a big part of  his life. "I was carved from this great city," he said during a recent interview. Gallo grew up on Buffalo's West Side in a "supportive, loving and extremely colorful family." He met his wife, Laura, in kindergarten, and still has many other friends from those childhood days. Buffalo remains such a big part of Gallo, that he said it's important that his son, raised in New York City, knows Buffalo's lifestyle and values.</p>
      <p>"We’re fortunate that we get to spend a lot of time here with him, especially in the summer," Gallo said. "Man, this city in the summer, something to behold. Consequently, my son is the biggest Buffalo fan I know."</p>

      <p>His favorite spots to visit when he's home: Delaware Park, the Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Coles, Ashker's (for cold-pressed juice), Slow Roll and his mother-in-law's leather chair. Another thing he looks forward to: "The day I get to shoot a film in Buffalo, that would be a dream."</p>
      <p>"The Irishman" has its <a href="https://buffalonews.com/2019/11/18/scorseses-epic-irishman-hits-buffalo-cinemas-before-netflix/">Buffalo premiere</a> at the Dipson Eastern Hills and North Park theaters on Nov. 21. It starts streaming on Netflix on Nov. 27.</p>
      <p>Here are excerpts from the interview with Gallo.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Question: How did your casting in “The Irishman” come about? </b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Answer:</b> I was called in to read ... I knew it was for a Martin Scorsese film, but that’s all I knew ... months went by. I figured it just didn't happen; my opportunity to work with Scorsese was a bust. Out of the blue, I got a call that they wanted to cast me. I was totally blown away. I had no idea what the role was but it didn’t really matter to me because I was cast in a Scorsese film. After I found out I would be playing Anthony Giacalone, I dove into his life. </p>

      <p>
        <b>Q: What was it like to work with Scorsese, De Niro and Pacino?</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>A:</b> The production was massive. Working with Marty on his beautiful playground was unlike anything I had ever experienced. ... He laughs all the time; you can see that he has so much fun doing what he does. </p>
      <p>To be sitting at a table watching De Niro and Pacino was the greatest acting class I have ever had. I would say to Stephen Graham, “Man, this is crazy working on this film with them. I know it’s probably not as crazy for you, but for me this is insane.” And he would say, “Are you crazy? This is just as insane for me.”</p>
      <p>It’s every actor’s dream. An opportunity to intimately work with De Niro and Pacino together, in the same room, at the same table, while Scorsese directs is beyond rare.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Q: Your Florida sit-down scene with De Niro, Pacino and Graham is certainly one of the film’s most memorable.</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>A:</b> The only metaphor I can offer is that it was like being asked to record a song with the Beatles at Abbey Road. In between every shot set up I would call my mom and we would cry with excitement, and then I would go back in and do my thing. </p>

      <p>
        <b>Q: Your career has been so varied — film, TV, theater — and you’ve worked as a writer and director, as well. </b>
      </p>
      <p><b>A:</b> I’m always directing my own films and I also regularly direct, edit and produce a show on the Travel Channel called “Ghost Adventures.” But I’m also not one to ever wait for a gig; if one isn’t being presented to me then I’m making something.</p>
      <p><b>Q:</b> <b>What are you thoughts on the finished film?</b></p>
      <p><b>A:</b> I knew it would be a brilliant work of art because it's Scorsese, but after seeing it my expectations were dwarfed. It was better, bigger, funnier and sadder than I ever thought it could be."</p>
