      <p>Tyson Fury will be enjoying a ‘well-earned rest’ rather than attending Deontay Wilder’s rematch with Luis Ortiz on Saturday, though trainer Ben Davison will make the trip to Las Vegas.</p>
      <p>WBC heavyweight champion Wilder faces off against Ortiz just under two years after stopping the Cuban in the 10th round of their thrilling fight in New York, with a hotly anticipated rematch with Fury scheduled for February 22 should he come through the contest.</p>
      <p>The Gypsy King has been busy since his last fight, making his WWE debut and doing <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/mma/">MMA</a> training, but Davison says he will not be ringside at the MGM Grand Garden Arena.</p>

      <p>Asked if Fury will be in Vegas for the fight, Davison told <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/boxing/">Boxing</a><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0HcWJeubpg"> Social</a>: ‘No. He’s having a well-earned bit of rest now.’</p>

      <p>On whether he will be doing any wrestling or MMA instead, he added: ‘I couldn’t tell you that he’s not doing anything like that because you never know. He could be doing a skydive, you never know. He’s a very unpredictable guy.’</p>
      <p>Although Fury will not be present, Davison is looking to scout the opposition, explaining: ‘I’m going over there because if I can see one thing, and pick up just one thing that I didn’t see and haven’t seen while watching hours upon hours upon hours of him, then it’s worth it.</p>
      <p>‘In this game 1% can make a difference. The margin of errors are so small, so for me to go over there [is important]. I could have just flown over there on the Friday and watched the fight but I also want to watch the media workout, see if I can see something, and like I say if I can spot one thing it’s worth it.</p>
      <p>‘In regards to the fight, I think Ortiz – although he’s obviously older now than when they fought the first time – I think he’ll still be very reactive for the first three or four rounds.</p>
      <p>‘But as we always say, if Wilder lands flush in the first 10 seconds or the last 10 seconds, he can more than likely end the fight. So it’s an interesting one.</p>

      <p>‘At this level it boils down to tactics. If Ortiz cannot take away Wilder’s right hand then he’s not going to last very long. But if Wilder doesn’t respect Ortiz and isn’t smart and setting things up and is a little too eager, he could get tipped upside down himself.’</p>

      <p>On whether Fury-Wilder II will definitely happen in February, he added: ‘To my knowledge, yes. What date and what this and what that, that’s not my job. That’s the broadcasters and the promoters and the management. I just get told that’s the date and that’s that, we organise training and the rest of it.’</p>
