      <p>Netflix declined to comment.</p>
      <p>The film was released in 1974 and starred Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway.</p>
      <p>Nicholson played Gittes, who is originally hired to expose an adulterer but becomes embroiled in a much larger plot. Roman Polanski directed with Robert Evans producing.</p>
      <p>The film became a box office and critical hit upon its release, racking up eleven Academy Award nominations. Towne ultimately took home the film’s lone Oscar for best original screenplay.</p>
      <p>A sequel titled “The Two Jakes” was released in 1990 with Nicholson and Towne returning.</p>
      <p>In addition to his Oscar win for <i>“Chinatown”,</i> Towne was nominated for his work on the screenplays for the films “<i>The Last Detail</i>” – another Nicholson starring vehicle – as well as <i>“Shampoo”</i> and “<i>Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes</i>“. His other credited works include “<i>The Firm</i>” and “<i>Mission: Impossible</i>“.</p>
      <p>Fincher previously worked with Netflix during his time on the critically-acclaimed drama “<i>House of Cards</i>“, on which he served as executive producer in addition to directing the first two episodes.</p>
      <p>He is best known for his film work, having directed films such as “<i>Seven</i>“, “<i>Gone Girl</i>“, “<i>The Curious Case of Benjamin Button</i>“, and “<i>The Social Network</i>“.</p>
