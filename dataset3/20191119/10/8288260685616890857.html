      <p>Meet the 87-year-old who has been barred from a charity shop - because she 'causes too much trouble'.</p>
      <p>The pensioner says she was told police would be called when she visited her local shop.</p>
      <p>Brenda, from Liverpool, said she visited her local YMCA charity shop on Three Tuns Lane in Formby Village on Sunday, <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/brenda-87-barred-charity-shop-17277525">reports the Liverpool ECHO.</a></p>
      <p>But the OAP was told by a manager that she was "barred" from the store and if she did not leave they would "phone the police."</p>

      <p>Brenda, who is deaf and partially sighted, lives with her 91-year-old husband Lesley.</p>
      <p>She she was left feeling "pertrified" and "angry" at being told to leave, because she had "done nothing wrong."</p>
      <p>"It's the first time I've been into the shop since August," she said.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"So I walked into the shop yesterday and after I'd walked three quarters of the way around because I was looking for something for my husband - that's all, I wasn't being intrusive - this woman comes over all of a sudden.</p>
      <p>"She said 'you're barred from here, you shouldn't be in this shop.'</p>
      <p>"I said 'I beg your pardon?' and she said 'you know you're barred from this shop because you come in here and you cause trouble'."</p>

      <p>She said: "I never cause any trouble, I'm an old lady.</p>
      <p>"I went back to the counter and I said 'can I have a quiet word with you or someone senior?'</p>
      <p>"I just wanted to tell her that I can't see the prices so I have to get people to help me read things.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"She said 'get out now or I will call the police'.</p>
      <p>"I was petrified. I was on my way out of the door anyway but it made me feel angry because I do not go around causing trouble at all.</p>
      <p>"My family were livid when I got home and told them."</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Brenda said it is not the first time she has been approached by the manager in the charity shop.</p>
      <p>In the summer, Brenda had purchased a chest of drawers to be delivered to her house at the time, at a cost of £20, and said she was confronted by a manager at the charity shop for "discussing the costs of delivering furniture with other customers."</p>
      <p>Brenda added: "She had cornered me in the summer and said I was discussing the costs of delivering furniture with other customers.</p>
      <p>"She said I believe you come in here every week causing trouble and it's offending the customers.</p>
      <p>"I paid for a chest and I paid for the £20 for it to be delivered with no objection whatsoever."</p>
