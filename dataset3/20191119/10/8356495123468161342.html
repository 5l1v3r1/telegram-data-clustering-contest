      <p>The A2 Milk Company expects continued strong growth for its speciality dairy products with increased marketing investment in China and the United States.</p>
      <p>New Zealand's largest listed company said first half revenue for the period ending in December was expected to be in a range of $780 million to $800m, which compared with last year's $613.1m.</p>
      <p>Gross margins were expected to be in a range of 29 and 30 percent, with full year underlying profit expected to be up on last year's $413.6m</p>
      <p>The company said in a presentation to shareholders at this morning's annual meeting that gross margins would benefit from better prices and reduced input costs.</p>
      <p>It expected about a 84 percent increase in sales of its China label infant nutrition to a forecast $135m, with a 54 percent increase in cross-border online sales to $155m.</p>
      <p>Sales of English-label infant nutrition products were forecast to rise about 9 percent to $350m, with sales to the US expected to grow by 110 percent to $27m.</p>
      <p>Australia fresh milk sales were forecast to rise 12 percent to $75m.</p>
      <p>A2 Milk said it would spend about $200m on marketing this financial year.</p>
      <p>The company had also extended its manufacturing and supply arrangements with Synlait Milk, to meet its forecast growth.</p>
      <p>The agreement covered the speciality milk producer's platinum product and other nutritional products, which were announced nearly 17 months ago.</p>
      <p>The initial agreement had a minimum term of five years, with a rolling three-year term from next August.</p>
      <p>The revised agreement extends the terms of the original agreement by two years to at least the end of July 2025.</p>
      <p>The change will also increase the volume of nutritional products Synlait produces on an exclusive basis for A2 Milk.</p>
      <p>The agreement also provided for an increase in Synlait's committed production capacity, as well as new pricing to reflect the parties' commitment to competitive pricing.</p>
