      <p>"We have now finalised and submitted our reports on the incident to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service's Health and Safety Investigation Unit for their further consideration."</p>
      <p>Once all final reports have been submitted the Crown will determine the cause of death and decide whether or not there should be prosecution proceedings or a Fatal Accident Inquiry.</p>
      <p>The Crown has also received a death report from Police Scotland, but is still awaiting a prosecution report from the police.</p>
      <p>A Crown Office spokesman said: "The Crown is committed to ensuring that the facts and circumstances surrounding the deaths of Simon Midgley and Richard Dyson are thoroughly investigated by the relevant agencies, fully considered by COPFS and, in due course, aired in an appropriate legal forum.</p>
      <p>"The nearest relatives will continue to be kept updated in relation to any significant developments."</p>
