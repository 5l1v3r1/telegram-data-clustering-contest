      <p>The Green Party has set out plans to invest a £100 billion a year in tackling climate change.</p>
      <p>Its General Election manifesto includes legislation for a ‘Green New Deal’, intended to get Britain to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2030.</p>
      <p>The party – which is strongly pro-Remain – is also promising a ‘People’s Vote’ bill for a fresh referendum on Britain’s relationship with the EU.</p>
      <p>Under its plans, the Greens would raise £91 billion a year for the next decade for capital expenditure on tackling the climate crisis.</p>
      <p>A further £9 billion a year in operational spending would be funded through raising taxes, including corporation tax, which would rise to 24%.</p>

      <p>The party argues that the borrowing is both justified – given environmental concerns – and a way to kick start economic and social regeneration. It added that public sector investment would act as a catalyst for private sector investment, as private investors seek to share in the financial rewards of a transition to a low carbon economy.</p>

      <p>Co-leader Jonathan Bartley explained: ‘We’re proud to put forward a manifesto which puts us on track to remain in the European Union and make the whole country carbon neutral by 2030, while delivering social justice across Britain.</p>
      <p>‘It’s the most ambitious Green new deal proposed anywhere in the world. While the other parties are trying to catch up, we’re still racing ahead, reaching new horizons.’</p>
      <p>The Green New Deal has been attracting attention in the USA, where it is seen as a potential modern-day version of the famous ‘New Deal’ reforms undertaken by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.</p>
      <p>The Greens say a British version ‘will unleash an urgently needed green economic and social revolution’.</p>

      <p>The manifesto launch comes amid a shift in polling suggesting climate is seen as increasingly important to the British public, with the ‘school strikes’ and activism by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/extinction-rebellion/">Extinction Rebellion</a> pushing the issue into the spotlight.</p>
      <p>In other measures, the party said it would increase NHS funding by at least £6 billion a year, scrap university tuition fees and introduce a universal basic income (UBI) with a ‘phased-in unconditional payment to everyone at a level above their subsistence needs’.</p>
      <p>Its UBI scheme would eventually see everyone in the country – regardless of their wealth or employment status – paid a lump sum.</p>

      <p>The party would also scrap the first-past-the-post system in elections, replacing it with proportional representation, create a fully elected House of Lords and extend voting rights to 16 and 17 year-olds.</p>
      <p>Former leader and Green MP Caroline Lucas tweeted: ‘Our Green New Deal will address both the climate crisis &amp; crisis of social justice.</p>
      <p>‘Don’t settle for less’.</p>
      <p>The Greens are currently on around 3%, according to<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/tories-surge-ahead-election-polls-ahead-tv-debate-11179542/"> the latest polls</a>.</p>
