      <p>No stranger to Dubai World Cup night, the reigning Golden Shaheen (G1) winner <b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/horse/X_Y_Jet">X Y Jet</a></b> has returned to serious training in South Florida and signaled his readiness last Friday with a bullet half-mile breeze in 46.70 seconds at the Palm Meadows Training Center.</p>
      <p>The son of Kantharos has put in five breezes since returning from a break, with the most-recent piece of work his most serious to date. It stopped the clock nearly four seconds faster than his Nov. 6 breeze.</p>
      <p>“He is doing great,” said Jorge Navarro, trainer of the three-time Dubai World Cup night alum. “I’m very happy with the way he is coming out (of the work).”</p>
      <p>Owned by Rockingham Ranch and Gelfenstein Farm, the nearly white luminary has not raced since his March 30 victory at Meydan, which came one year after he was edged out for a victory by Mind Your Biscuits.</p>
      <p>X Y Jet shows 12 wins from 25 starts, including eight stakes wins. The majority of his $3,095,513 in earnings comes from his trio of Dubai Golden Shaheen starts, which includes another second in 2016 behind Muarrab.</p>
      <p>Before taking another shot at the lucrative sprint next season at age 8, the gelding will prep at Gulfstream Park. He's a two-time winner of the Mr. Prospector Stakes (G3), which renews on Dec. 21, and has also won three editions of the Sunshine Millions Sprint Stakes that goes on Jan. 18.</p>
