      <h2>Shoppers can bag themselves a last minute bonus in time for December with lenders offering hundreds of pounds when you switch - but where's best to move to and what perks are up for grabs? We've taken a look</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T10:17:44+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 10:17</time> by <a rel="author">Emma Munbodh, https://www.facebook.com/EmmaMunbodh</a></address>
      <p>It's late November, but there's still time to save for the festive season, with banks giving out free cash in the run up to the most expensive time of the year.</p>
      <p>HSBC, Natwest and First Direct are leading the way when it comes to switching rewards this month, offering new account holders the chance to bag a quick bonus in time for Christmas.</p>
      <p>Switching rewards are usually reserved for new customers only - they're paid as incentives for those who transfer to a new account using the Current Account Switch Service.</p>
      <p>And anyone can benefit, providing you move your main incomings, are new to the bank or building society and meet the minimum terms, ie have at least £1,000 coming in each month.</p>
      <p>But why switch? As tempting as it may seem, it's not just about the free cash.</p>
      <p>While a bonus can seem attractive, it's important to look at the switching criteria, how happy you are with your current lender and any overdrafts or loans you have before committing elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Check what the bank is offering on top of the cash perk - ie travel insurance, ask about overdraft fees, any monthly fees, and check that you meet the minimum requirements.</p>
      <p>We've got a full guide on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/money/best-bank-account-free-money-11835430">switching bank accounts here - and the questions to ask before moving your money</a>.</p>

      <p>Top of the list is HSBC this month, with a £175 bonus for new current account holders when you join this month.</p>
      <p>Customers who join its Advance Bank Account will get £175 within 30 days of moving across.</p>
      <p>To get the bonus, you must switch within 30 days along with two direct debits or standing orders.</p>
      <p>You'll also get access to a 2.75% regular savings account through it.</p>
      <p>To get the reward, customers must apply using the Current Account Switch Service (CASS). You'll also need to pay in a minimum of £1,750 to keep the account open or £10,500 every six months.</p>
      <p>Your £175 bonus will then be credited to your bank account within 30-days of completion of the switch.</p>

      <p>You can get another £80 gift card (£120 if you have an M&amp;S Bank credit card) after a year if you pay in £1,250 a month.</p>
      <p>To qualify, you must move over at least four direct debits, and register for online banking and statements.</p>

      <p>If you know someone with a Nationwide current account, savings account or mortgage, it could be a win:win if they refer you.</p>
      <p>If you switch to a Nationwide FlexAccount, FlexDirect or FlexPlus account – including at least two direct debits – you'll both get £100.<br/><br/>The referrer needs to fill in a form with their details, then email their referral link to their friend. The referee needs to follow that link and enter details including their 'switch reference number'.</p>
      <p>The £100 will be paid into both accounts within 30 days of the switch completing.</p>
