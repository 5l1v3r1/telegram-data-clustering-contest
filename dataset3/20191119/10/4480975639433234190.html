      <h1>EUR/USD likely to keep the broad sidelined trade – UOB</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T10:11:56+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 10:11</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/pablo-piovano" target="_blank">Pablo Piovano</a></address>
      <p>FX Strategists at UOB Group expect <b><a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/eurusd">EUR/USD</a></b> to extend the ongoing consolidation for the time being.</p>
      <h3>Key Quotes</h3>
      <p>24-hour view: “Our view for EUR yesterday was that it “could edge higher towards 1.1075” but we noted “the next <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance">resistance</a> at 1.1100 is unlikely to come into the picture”. EUR subsequently rose and touched 1.1090 before easing off. The advance appears to be running ahead of itself and further sustained rise in EUR is not expected for today. That said, a retest of 1.1090 is not ruled out but any up-move is viewed as part of a higher 1.1050/1.1090 range”.</p>
      <p>Next 1-3 weeks: “There is not much to add to the update from yesterday (18 Nov, spot at 1.1055). As highlighted, the recent weak phase has ended and the “near-term bias on the upside”. For now, we continue to view any advance as part of a 1.1010/1.1115 sideway-trading range even though the prospect for a sustained rise above 1.1115 has increased. All in, the current mild upward pressure is expected to remain intact unless EUR drops back below 1.1030 within these few days”.</p>
