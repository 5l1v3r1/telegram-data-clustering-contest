      <h1>Sobhi Warns SA: ‘Let’s Not Forget We Scored Six…’</h1>

      <p>Egyptian star, Ramadan Sobhi, has warned South Africa not to forget their goalscoring record at the U23 African Cup of Nations so far ahead of tonight’s big semi-final.</p>

      <p>The 22-year-old already has plenty of senior international experienced to his name after bursting onto the scene as a teenager, but he was called into the Egyptian U23 side as they chase a place at the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo.</p>
      <p>Sobhi is one of three players who have scored for Egypt on home soil at the U23 AFCON currently taking place, with Mostafa Mohamed a real danger man for David Notoane’s side to keep an eye on after his four goals in three games so far.</p>
      <p>While Egypt are the highest-scoring team of the semi-finalists, and South Africa – with one goal – are the lowest-scoring, Notoane will be buoyed by the fact that his side is yet to concede in the tournament and have three clean sheets in a row. </p>
      <p>Sobhi is eager to change that though, telling the media, “We played three really good games but we still haven’t achieved anything. Our goal is to qualify for the Olympics… We dealt really well with the pressure. The only source of pressure is the responsibility we have and I hope it won’t affect us.</p>
      <p>“They’re a very clever side, but let’s not forget that we scored six goals. Since our win against Cameroon in the third round we’ve been studying their strengths and weaknesses. And we’ll work on making the most out of our chances. </p>

      </p>
      <p>“We don’t have any individual ambitions. The most important thing is to reach the Olympics, then we can think about other goals such as playing abroad, which could be more easily achieved if we get more exposure by playing in Tokyo.”</p>
      <p>South Africa and Egypt lock horns at 20h00 this evening. </p>
