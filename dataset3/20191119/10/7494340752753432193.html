      <p>The Indian government said on Tuesday that it is "empowered" to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/19/india-intercept-monitor-citizen-computers/">intercept, monitor, or decrypt any digital communication "generated, transmitted, received, or stored" on a citizen's device in the country</a> in the interest of national security or to maintain friendly relations with foreign states. From a report:<i> Citing section 69 of the Information Technology Act, 2000, and section 5 of the Telegraph Act, 1885, Minister of State for Home Affairs G. Kishan Reddy said local law empowers federal and state government to "intercept, monitor or decrypt or cause to be intercepted or monitored or decrypted any information generated, transmitted, received or stored in any computer resource in the interest of the sovereignty or integrity of India, the security of the state, friendly relations with foreign states or public order or for preventing incitement to the commission of any cognizable offence relating to above or for investigation of any offence." Reddy's remarks were in response to the parliament, where a lawmaker had asked if the government had snooped on citizens' WhatsApp, Messenger, Viber, and Google calls and messages.</i></p>
