      <p>The topic soon turns to Caitlyn's transition from man to woman, "I thought I was gonna transition before I was 40."</p>

      <p>The reality star recalls another time when, "Some guy in a pick up truck beeps his horn."</p>
      <p>"And you look over and he’s like blowing kisses."</p>
      <p>She reveals she would listen to Aerosmith’s <i>Dude Looks like A Lady</i> in the car.</p>
      <h3>The camp reacts</h3>
      <p>Caitlyn's fellow camp-mates are in awe at her story.</p>
      <p>James sympathises, "It’s interesting about wanting to express yourself and how hard it is in life wanting to express yourself, but having a thing where you can’t let it and that you have to drive around town."</p>

      <p>He shares his opinion, "I think the biggest thing about your thing is all those people thinking about not being able to do it is the fact they should feel comfortable to do it however hard it is because 99 per cent of the time it’ll work out alright."</p>
      <p>Caitlyn admits, "All my life I struggled with all of those."</p>
