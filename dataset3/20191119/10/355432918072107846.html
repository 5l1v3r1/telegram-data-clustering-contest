      <h1>Most Americans break with Trump on Ukraine, but just 45 percent think he should be removed: poll</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T10:00:15+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thehill.com/author/john-bowden" target="_blank">John Bowden</a></address>
      <p>A wide majority of Americans <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/19/780540637/poll-americans-overwhelmingly-say-impeachment-hearings-wont-change-their-minds">in a new poll</a> say that <a href="https://thehill.com/people/donald-trump">President Trump</a>'s actions involving Ukraine and former Vice President <a href="https://thehill.com/people/joe-biden">Joe Biden</a> were "unacceptable," but most do not want him removed from office. </p>
      <p>In an NPR-Marist College poll published Tuesday, 70 percent of respondents said that Trump was wrong to solicit a Ukrainian criminal investigation into Biden and his son Hunter Biden, as the former vice president mounts a 2020 presidential bid.</p>
      <p>Still, just 47 percent of Americans polled said that Trump should be impeached by the House, and just 45 percent said that the Senate should convict the president and remove him from office. Forty-four percent said that Trump should not be removed from office or that they were unsure, while 46 percent said that the House should not vote to impeach the president.</p>
      <p>Independent voters were split evenly on the evidence, with 45 percent on either side of whether what has been presented so far merits impeachment by the House.</p>
      <p>“Strictly on the merits of what has been presented, people think it is wrong for a president to interject a foreign leader into the United States’ electoral politics,” Lee Miringoff of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion said in a press release accompanying the poll. “The disagreement is on whether or not it is a big deal which warrants impeachment.”</p>
      <p>Nearly two-thirds of Americans said they they were watching the impeachment proceedings at least fairly regularly, while 37 percent said they were "not closely" watching the proceedings.</p>
