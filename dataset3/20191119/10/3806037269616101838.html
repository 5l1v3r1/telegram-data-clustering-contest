      <h1>Fox Files Trademark Application for "OK, Boomer"</h1>
      <h2>With plans to make a reality TV series.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T10:00:07+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 10:00</time> by <a rel="author">Mallory Chin</a></address>
      <p>Fox Media LLC has filed a trademark application for “OK, Boomer” and plans to name a television show after the phrase, reports <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2019/11/18/entertainment/ok-boomer-fox-trademark-trnd/index.html"><i>CNN</i></a>.</p>
      <p>On Monday, Washington, D.C. trademark lawyer and founder of <a href="https://www.gerbenlaw.com/">Gerben Law Firm</a>, Josh Gerben, revealed the news on Twitter via a screenshot. Fox filed the application on Monday, November 11. The attorney for Fox has signed a sworn intent that the company has a “bona fide intent” to launch a TV series called “OK BOOMER,” and Gerben says that it could be “a reality, comedy and/or game show.” “It would seem unlikely that a company of this size would file such an application unless a show was being considered,” Gerben tells <i>CNN</i>.</p>
      <p>Along with Fox, several other applications to trademark the phrase have been filed over the past month. On October 31, New York-based Kevin Yen filed an application for a clothing brand. In addition to Fox and Yen, a Pittsburgh-based company also filed for a brand of stickers and decals, while producer William Grundfest filed a trademark in his name personally for a stage play.</p>
      <p>“In all likelihood, the USPTO will deny all of these applications because OK BOOMER has become a ‘widely used message,’” Gerben said. “A trademark registration will not issue in a phrase that is commonly used to convey a social or political message. This is because such a ‘viral’ phrase is incapable of identifying the source of a product or service — which is what trademarks must do to be capable of registration.”</p>
      <p>The now viral phrase first appeared on TikTok and soon took on a life of its own. The slogan is used mostly by teens and millennials to poke fun at older generations that are seen as out of touch. Most notably, 25-year-old New Zealand lawmaker Chlöe Swarbrick used the phrase to dismiss an older member of parliament for heckling her while she spoke about the country’s Zero Carbon Bill.</p>
