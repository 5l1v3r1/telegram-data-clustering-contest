      <p>Sony's flagship line of phones is set to expand again in 2020, if the latest rumor turns out to be true, as a new leak suggests the company will be introducing four new handsets throughout the year that will all sport top-end specs.</p>
      <p>According to a new leak from Japanese website Android Next, the company is set to introduce an Xperia 0, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/sony-xperia-2">Xperia 1.1</a>, Xperia 3 and Xperia 5.1.</p>
      <p>All four of these phones are rumored to be powered by the upcoming Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 chipset and support <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/what-is-5g-everything-you-need-to-know">5G connectivity</a>, but will come in a variety of sizes and with different specs on each.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Everything rumored for the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/sony-xperia-2">Xperia 1.1</a></li>
        <li>The <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/best-sony-phones">best Sony phones</a> you can buy right now</li>
        <li>What we thought of the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/sony-xperia-5-review">Sony Xperia 5</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>The leak suggests the Xperia 0 will be the highest spec device, but it's unlikely to launch until towards the end of the year at IFA 2020 - that's an event that takes place in August - with the other handsets likely to launch sooner.</p>
      <p>The Xperia 0 is expected to have the most cameras out of all the devices with six on the rear and a 5K display on the front of the phone. We've previously seen a similar camera leak for a <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/camera-specs-leaked-for-sonys-eight-lens-xperia-smartphone">Sony phone with six lenses on the rear</a>.</p>
      <p>The Xperia 1.1 is reportedly ready to be introduced at <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/mwc-2020">MWC 2020</a> in February - that makes sense as the original <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/sony-xperia-1-review">Xperia 1</a> was unveiled at that show this year - and will likely come with a 4K display and four cameras on the rear.</p>
      <p>Android Next's leak also suggests an Xperia 5.1 will be announced alongside it with four rear cameras and a QHD display. There's also rumors of an Xperia 3 that will come with a QHD display as well as three rear cameras, but there's no rumored launch date for that product.</p>
      <p>On top of all this, the leak suggests the company will be introducing a new series of mid-range devices that are likely to be follow-up products to the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/sony-xperia-10-review">Xperia 10</a> and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/sony-xperia-10-plus-review">Xperia 10 Plus</a>. These are also expected to come with 5G support, but won't sport the top-end chipset.</p>
      <p>All in all, we're taking this information with a pinch of salt, but it does make sense that Sony will be updating its series of devices after introducing a relatively small line of handsets in 2019.</p>
      <p>It's unlikely we'll hear anything official from Sony until next year, with February's MWC event likely to be where we see the company officially unveil its next series of devices.</p>
