        <b>Scotland's final Euro 2020 is a dead rubber, but should provide intrigue ahead of the UEFA Nation's League playoffs.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Scots earned a 2-1 win over a spirited Cyprus side in their penultimate fixture, with goals from Ryan Christie and John McGinn.</p>

      <p>On Tuesday night Steve Clarke's men face Kazakhstan in their final group stage game.</p>
      <p>The Kazakhs currently sit in 5th place on ten points, just two points behind Scotland. Earlier in the campaign they dished out a catastrophic 3-0 battering to an Alex McLeish-managed Scotland side.</p>
      <p>A defeat for Scotland tonight could see them fall to fifth place in the group behind Kazakhstan and Cyprus, while a win would seal third place behind Belgium and Russia.</p>
