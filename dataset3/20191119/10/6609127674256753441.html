      <p>We told recently how a 'traumatised' pensioner was <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4957700/paisley-robbery-pensioner-attack/">attacked in her own home by a callous thug</a> - who nicked cash, bank cards and house keys.</p>
      <p>The 88-year-old woman was assaulted at the property in Windsor Crescent, Paisley, at around 6.25pm on Thursday.</p>
      <p>The brute then made off with a three-figure sum of money, along with the cards and keys.</p>
      <p>And a Glasgow man was<a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4954909/glasgow-dog-steal-castlemilk/"> 'slashed on the head six times’</a>by three violent hooded thugs who tried to steal his dog.</p>
      <p>He was ambushed within the wooded area between Tormusk Road and Fenhill Road in Castlemilk this morning by the trio who tried to nick his Rottweiler.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/4954909/glasgow-dog-steal-castlemilk/">Horrifying photos on social media</a> showed the victim’s grim injuries after the brutal attack - with blood pouring from his head.</p>
