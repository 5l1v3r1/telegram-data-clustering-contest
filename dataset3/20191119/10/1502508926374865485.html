      <h1>What trade war? Chinese firms beat expectations, post strong Q3 numbers</h1>
      <h2>Profits at Chinese companies grew 10% in the July-September period, beating the 2% growth rate analysts had predicted</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T10:33:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 10:33</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>The top 200 <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/chinese-companies">Chinese </a><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/international-news-companies-1160101.htm">companies </a>spanning consumer, technology, industrial, property and financial industries reported September quarter earnings well ahead of market expectations, setting them up for a strong showing next year, analysts said.</p>
      <p>These <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/international-news-companies-1160101.htm">companies </a>mostly beat lowered market expectations as consumer spending remained strong, boosted by Chinese shoppers who opted to buy at home than to travel abroad, as a weaker yuan inflated travel costs.</p>
      <p>Profits at <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/chinese-companies">Chinese </a><a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/international-news-companies-1160101.htm">companies </a>grew 10% in the July-September period, beating the 2% growth rate analysts had predicted, and ahead of China's slowing economic growth rate. Only companies with a market capitalization of over $1 billion and tracked by at least three analysts are covered in this analysis.<br/><br/>Analysts added that earnings growth at Asian companies, excluding Japan, is likely to bounce back in 2020, partly as trade concerns recede.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Below is a report card of the third quarter for Asian companies and expectations for next year</b>
      </p>
      <p>- Online retail giants Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and JD.com Inc posted strong sales as people bought baby products and sports gear. Western luxury and mass-market consumer companies had a good quarter as well.</p>
      <p>- Overall, profitability at 1,625 Asian firms fell 5%, versus an expected 6% decline, according to a Reuters analysis of Refinitiv data. Results outperformed estimates for the first time in five quarters.</p>
      <p>- Hong Kong-listed firms are not included in this analysis, as most of them announce earnings results on a semi-annual basis.</p>
      <p>- Profits at 346 South Korean firms nearly halved, dragged down by lower chip prices and a fluctuation in commodity prices.</p>
      <p>- Profit at Samsung Electronics Co Ltd fell 56%. Smaller rival SK Hynix Inc posted its lowest profit in three years. Steelmaker Posco's earnings plunged by a third as iron ore prices rose.</p>
      <p>- Profits at 201 Indian firms rose 29.5%, led by consumer staples, financial and healthcare firms and helped by a corporate tax cut.</p>
      <p>- Profits at 673 Japanese firms which exclude SoftBank Group Corp, fell 1%, in line with estimates, as the yen firmed and demand fell for export items such as cars and machinery.</p>
      <p>- The top three Japanese steelmakers and carmakers Suzuki Motor Corp and Mitsubishi Motors Corp have reduced their annual profit forecasts.</p>
      <p>- Analysts expect profits at Asian firms to jump 13% in 2020, versus a 5% estimated increase this year, helped partly by recovering global demand as trade worries ease further.</p>
