      <h1>Duke climbs to No. 1 in AP Top 25 following Kentucky’s loss</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T10:27:01+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 10:27</time> by <a rel="author">Associated Press</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/duke-blue-devils">Duke</a> is back at No. 1, moving up a spot following a pair of victories last week.</p>
      <p>The Blue Devils can thank Evansville for the jump.</p>
      <p>Duke moved to No. 1 for the first time this season, receiving 52 first-place votes from a 65-member media panel in <a href="https://apnews.com/APTop25CollegeBasketballPoll">The Associated Press men’s college basketball poll</a> released Monday.</p>
      <p>The Blue Devils climbed a spot after <a href="https://apnews.com/f4e271dfa89d4d49a42fd4a0d23c6ee7">unranked Evansville</a> pulled off the season’s biggest surprise so far by knocking off previous No. 1 <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/kentucky-wildcats">Kentucky.</a></p>
      <p>Duke is ranked No. 1 for the 143rd week, extending its own record, and has the top spot in the AP poll for the 20th season under coach Mike Krzyzewski, also a record.</p>
      <p>“Our sport is more prone to upset than any because there are just five people out there, so there’s age, athleticism, maturity, depth and a lot of things where people can make up differences,” Krzyzewski said. “That’s why there are a lot of so-called upsets in our sport. A lot of people can win and you have to be ready to play all those people.”</p>
      <p>Duke (4-0) crushed Central Arkansas 105-54 last Tuesday and beat Georgia State 74-63 on Friday behind Tre Jones’ career-high 31 points.</p>
      <p>No. 2 Louisville received eight first-place votes and No. 3 Michigan State, the preseason No. 1, had four.</p>
      <p>Kansas and <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/north-carolina-tar-heels">North Carolina</a> rounded out the top five, with No. 7 <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/ncaa/virginia-cavaliers">Virginia</a> receiving the final first-place vote, one spot behind Maryland.</p>
      <p>Kentucky was the overwhelming pick at No. 1 last week, receiving all but one first-place vote after <a href="https://apnews.com/17d908fd9cfb4b75a26466171f73667c">knocking off previous No. 1 Michigan State</a> in its opener.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://apnews.com/ae8d02b0f0174dedb9bd56e634766a01">Wildcats</a> dropped to No. 9 this week with the 67-64 loss to Evansville in Lexington.</p>
      <p>“This was a great lesson for all of us, including me,” Kentucky coach John Calipari said. “I mean, we could say they got outplayed and I could tell you I got out-coached.”</p>
      <p>
        <b>TOP 10 SHUFFLE</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kentucky’s loss caused a shift in the top 10.</p>
      <p>Every team behind the Wildcats moved up a spot except for Gonzaga, which held at No. 8.</p>
      <p>No. 10 Ohio State cracked the top 10 for the first time since reaching No. 8 in 2017-18, coach Chis Holtmann’s first season. The Buckeyes climbed six spots after <a href="https://apnews.com/84f78cdd8b464035811dc4b56889dfea">crushing then-No. 10 Villanova</a>.</p>
      <p>
        <b>RISING</b>
      </p>
      <p>Ohio State had the biggest jump in this week’s poll, followed by No. 14 Arizona’s five-spot climb.</p>
      <p>Auburn moved up three places from No. 22.</p>
      <p>
        <b>FALLING</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kentucky’s eight-place fall was the biggest of the week. Villanova was next, losing seven spots to No. 17 and No. 25 Washington fell five places.</p>
      <p>
        <b>MOVING IN</b>
      </p>
      <p>Three teams moved into the AP Top 25 this week.</p>
      <p>No. 20 Tennessee is ranked for the first time this season after knocking off Washington.</p>
      <p>No. 21 Virginia Commonwealth, the preseason No. 25, is back in the poll following a two-point win over LSU and a rout of Jacksonville State.</p>
      <p>Texas moved in at No. 22 with wins over California Baptist and Prairie View. The Longhorns are ranked for the first time this season.</p>
      <p>
        <b>MOVING OUT</b>
      </p>
      <p>Florida had a <a href="https://apnews.com/1289f913006542f3830eaf84661c7a61">precipitous drop</a> after losing to Connecticut, falling out of the poll from No. 15.</p>
      <p>LSU was out from No. 23 following its <a href="https://apnews.com/b6d02c631dc2499a9fa83905d05294d6">loss to VCU</a> and Saint Mary’s dropped out from No. 18 after losing to Winthrop at home.</p>
