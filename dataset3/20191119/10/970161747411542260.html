      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/jorginho/">Jorginho</a> insists <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/chelsea-fc/">Chelsea</a> are not thinking about challenging for the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> title despite being joint second in the table.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/liverpool-fc/">Liverpool</a> are eight points clear at the top of the league, with Leicester City and Chelsea the sides closest to the high-flying Reds.</p>
      <p>Chelsea’s young guns are <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/paul-merson-picks-three-chelsea-stars-can-end-manchester-citys-title-defence-11089618/">being tipped as this season’s dark horses</a>, but Jorginho claims the Blues are concentrating on securing a Champions League spot.</p>
      <p>‘The first thing we need to think about is top four,’ Jorginho told VBET News.</p>

      <p>Chelsea take on <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/19/eden-hazard-chelsea-manchester-city-premier-league-11179118/">defending champions Manchester City at the Etihad this weekend</a>, with Pep Guardiola’s men aiming to bounce back from a demoralising loss to Liverpool before the international break.</p>
      <p>City are big favourites to beat Chelsea and Jorginho conceded it would be a difficult task to beat the Sky Blues in Manchester.</p>
      <p>‘What can you say about Manchester City? They’re one of the best teams in the world and we know that,’ Jorginho explained.</p>

      <p>‘We have to work hard and try to win, because we do want to win every game. It’ll be hard.’</p>
