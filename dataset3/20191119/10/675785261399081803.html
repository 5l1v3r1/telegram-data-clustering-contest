      <h2>The first of the general election party leader debates takes place on ITV tonight, but which politicians will be taking part in the televised showdown?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T10:38:10+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 10:38</time> by <a rel="author">Lewis Knight, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/lewis-knight/</a></address>
      <p>With the general election fast approaching it is time to hear what the party leaders have to say for themselves.</p>
      <p>The December 12 election will see the political parties such as the Conservatives, Labour, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liberal-democrats">Liberal Democrats</a>, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/snp">SNP</a>, Brexit Party, Plaid Cymru, the Green Party, the DUP, and Sinn Fein look to represent the public in the House of Commons.</p>
      <p>As polling day draws nearer, the leaders of the parties are taking part in television debates to challenge their opponents in front for the public and make their cases to be the next prime minister.</p>
      <p>But when is the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/general-election">general election</a> debate on ITV tonight and who is taking part?</p>
      <h3>General election: What time is the debate on ITV tonight and who is taking part?</h3>
      <p><b>Johnson v Corbyn: The ITV debate</b> is on tonight on ITV and ITV Player at <b>8pm on December 19, 2019.</b></p>
      <p>As described by the title, the debate will take place between current prime minister and leader of the Conservative party <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> party leader and leader of the opposition <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-corbyn">Jeremy Corbyn</a>.</p>
      <p>The programme will be hosted by ITV regular host <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/julie-etchingham">Julie Etchingham</a>, who previously hosted the Conservative party leader debate between Johnson and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/jeremy-hunt">Jeremy Hunt</a>.</p>
      <p>Corbyn and Johnson will each have a minute for opening statements and then 45 seconds for closing statements, but in between they will be asked questions from ITV viewers from varying political beliefs and socio-economic backgrounds.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a>, the NHS, the economy, relations with the US, and each of the pair's own personal leadership troubles will likely be up for debate.</p>
