      <p>Nov. 19, 2019 -- It took months for the cause of a Scottish man's serious respiratory condition to be traced to a feather duvet and feather pillows, a case study says.</p>
      <p>Martin Taylor, 43, first developed symptoms such as difficulty breathing and <a href="https://www.webmd.com/brain/vertigo-symptoms-causes-treatment">dizzy spells</a> triggered by any amount of exertion, according to the study published in the <i>BMJ</i> journal.</p>
      <p>"Two months after the onset of the symptoms, I was unable to stand or walk for more than a few minutes at a time without feeling like I was going to pass out," he wrote in the study, <i>CNN</i> reported.</p>
      <p>"Going upstairs to bed was a 30-minute activity, as I could only manage two stairs at a time and then needed to sit and rest," Taylor added.</p>
      <p>After numerous medical appointments and tests, Taylor still had no answers.</p>
      <p>Finally, Dr. Owen John Dempsey, a consultant chest physician at BMI Albyn Hospital in Aberdeen, determined that Taylor had Feather Duvet <a href="https://www.webmd.com/lung/lung-diseases-overview">Lung disease</a>, a rare <a href="https://www.webmd.com/asthma/types-asthma">type of asthma</a> that's difficult to diagnose, <i>CNN</i> reported.</p>
      <p>Taylor was told to remove the feather bedding from his home and prescribed <a href="https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/ss/slideshow-steroids-101">steroids</a>, which improved his condition within two days.</p>
      <p>"The course of steroids continued ultimately for 12 months, with a gradual reduction in dose over time. I have thankfully been able to stop them completely," Taylor wrote.</p>
      <p>"I have not had any dizzy turns since recovering. It doesn't affect me at all now and my life is pretty much as it was before."</p>
