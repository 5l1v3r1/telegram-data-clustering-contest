      <h1>Committee of judges to examine insurance compensation levels in Ireland</h1>

        <b>A personal injuries committee made up of judges has been selected to examine insurance compensation levels in Ireland.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The announcement was made this morning by Chief Justice Frank Clarke at an insurance fraud conference in Dublin.</p>
      <p>It comes amid ongoing criticism over the level of compensation payouts in Ireland.</p>
      <p>Mr Justice Clarke said the committee will get to work straight away, despite not being formally established by law.</p>
      <p>He explained: "One of the issues that they will have to consider is bench-marking Irish damages by reference to other comparable countries - not just the UK, but other countries as well.</p>
      <blockquote>"If they were to wait until they are formally established before commencing that process, that would take time.</blockquote>
      <p>"But there's no reason why the process of putting in place that research cannot start straight away."</p>
      <p>Concerns have been raised in recent years about the levels of compensation and damages awarded here, as well as the cost of insurance.</p>
      <p>Small and medium businesses <b><a href="https://www.newstalk.com/news/rising-insurance-costs-isme-844693">have previously highlighted</a></b> the difficulty of obtaining public liability insurance due to the spiralling costs.</p>
      <p>Michael D'Arcy, the Minister of State with responsibility for insurance, <b><a href="https://www.newstalk.com/news/insurance-litigious-nature-ireland-829072">has previously suggested</a></b> high insurance payouts are fostering a "litigious nature" among Irish people.</p>
