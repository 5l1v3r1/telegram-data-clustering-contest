        <b>A local gang has murdered a woodworker after raping his wife in Jamalpur.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The incident took place on Friday night, police said.</p>
      <p>The woman has started a case against Sanowar Hossain, Shawon, and Rafiz Uddin over the incident.</p>
      <p>“Police arrested Shawon from Madhupur after the rape victim filed a case against three people,” said Jamalpur Sadar Police Station OC Md Salemuzzaman.</p>
      <p>The housewife told reporters that she was abducted and taken to a nearby jungle by Sanowar, Shawon, and Rafiz at 8pm on Friday while using a tube-well outside her home. The trio then tied her to a tree and raped her.</p>
      <p>When her husband returned from the market, they attacked him. After he died, the criminals hung his body on a tree and called it suicide, locals said.</p>
      <p>Police recovered the body from the murder scene on Saturday morning and sent it to morgue for autopsy. They later filed a case over the incident citing unnatural death.</p>
      <p>The woman was admitted to Sadar Hospital on Monday night.</p>
      <p>A family member has alleged that Sripur UP Chairman Azizul Haque Foni threatened them after the case was filed.</p>
      <p>No statement was available from the UP chairman on the incident.</p>
