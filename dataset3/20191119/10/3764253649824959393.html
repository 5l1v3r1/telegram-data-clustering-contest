        <b>November 29 is the 333rd day of the year, and the day when half of the Earth population goes crazy because of the biggest discounts for the year.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jiji.ng, the most prominent classified in Nigeria, doesn’t stay behind as well. The marketplace with 10 million unique active users has created a separate webpage for those goods with the biggest discounts for Black Friday. Legit.ng found out the details.</p>
      <h3>How it works</h3>
      <p>150,000 is the number of all sellers that place adverts on the marketplace right now. No wonder if they hope to benefit from Black Friday and attract more customers. To set potential buyers free from burdensome searches and help sellers to get on their radars, Jiji.ng offers top offers board.</p>
      <p>The main advantage of this page is that no human being is engaged to select which ad is good enough to be shown on the top offers board. The ads with the hugest discounts are aggregated on the board with the help of computer algorithms. Therefore, all sellers are on equal footing.</p>
