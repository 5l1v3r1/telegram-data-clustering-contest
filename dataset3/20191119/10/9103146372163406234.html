      <p><u>EDUCATION</u><br/><br/>KAMPALA - <b>The National Council of Higher Education (NCHE) has granted ISBAT University a charter that allows it to offer master’s and doctorate programs.  </b> <br/><br/>NCHE chairperson Prof Elly Katunguka on Monday handed over the charter document, certificate, and instruments signed by President Yoweri Museveni to the university chancellor Fred Jachan Omach at NCHE headquarters, Kyambogo in Kampala.<br/><br/>The function was witnessed by NCHE executive director Prof. Mary Okwakol, the university vice-chancellor Dr. K M Mathew, staff and students. <br/><br/>Katunguka implored the university administration to live by the expectation of a chartered university through employing permanent quality staff, qualified students, running accredited programs and quality assurance, among others.<br/><br/>“This success you have attained today comes with huge expectations from the public. Do not compromise on quality. Live by the charter standards. Don’t disappoint the NCHE which recommended you to the President for a charter. I can only advise you that work begins now to maintain that quality,” Katunguka said.<br/><br/>Prof Katunguka, who is also the Kyambogo University vice-chancellor, reiterated the need for higher institutions of learning to remodel the teaching in order to produce graduates fit for the job market.<br/><br/>“The onus is on us to win back public trust and give our students value for money. The public is tired of universities that produce graduates who are on streets to look for jobs,” he advised. <br/><br/>ISBAT vice-chancellor Dr. K M Mathew said, with students from over 26 countries, the university seeks to empower the lives of students into global citizens with internationally acclaimed curricular, global associations and accreditations.<br/><br/>He said their programs are developed along with the global standards, with credit balanced assessments, enabling credit mapping with global institutions of higher learning.<br/><br/>Initially established as a tertiary institution in 2005, moved on to the level of a degree-awarding institution and finally transformed in January 2016 into a fully-fledged university with own state-of-the-art metropolitan campus in Kampala. <br/><br/>A member of the Future Education and Technology Group, ISBAT University is well recognized and respected for imparting high-quality education and training in Uganda as well as in the East African region.</p>
