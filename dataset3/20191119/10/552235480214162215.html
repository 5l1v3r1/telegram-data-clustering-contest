      <h1>Coatbridge conman jailed after posing as tax official and raking in £30k</h1>
      <h2>Ryan Boyle will spend the next 18 months behind bars.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T10:44:28+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 10:44</time> by <a rel="author">Airdrie and Coatbridge Advertiser, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/airdrie-and-coatbridge-advertiser/</a></address>
      <p>A callous Coatbridge conman raked in more than £30,000 after using other people’s personal details to make fraudulent benefit claims.</p>
      <p>Ryan Boyle will spend the next 18 months behind bars for posing as a tax official and calling dozens of unwitting people to get their National Insurance numbers and other information.</p>
      <p>He persuaded Department of Work and Pension (DWP) staff that the applications he made were genuine and proceeded to pick up regular cash sums at pay points throughout Lanarkshire.</p>
      <p>Boyle, 33, of Argyll Gardens, admitted forming a fraudulent scheme to defraud the DWP and North Lanarkshire Council between March 2015 and June the following year.</p>
      <p>This is the second time brazen Boyle fraudulently got his hands on other people’s cash after he withdrew a three-figure sum – and tried to take out a further £1000 – from someone else’s bank account in his home town’s Halifax Bank of Scotland a decade ago; he was then ordered to repay £280 to the bank and fined £250.</p>
      <p>Relating to Boyle’s latest offence, Paula Russell, prosecuting, said the scam came to light when a man who had stopped claiming benefits because he had become self-employed was challenged by tax officials about money being applied for in his name.</p>
      <p>An investigation began and it emerged that Boyle had managed to get personal details from 55 people. He had failed in another 12 cases.</p>
      <p>The scam netted opportunistic Boyle, who was sentenced at Hamilton Sheriff Court last week, a whopping £30,174.71.</p>
      <p>Ms Russell said those involved could face “disastrous” consequences as a result of future benefits being refused because of their apparent involvement in fraudulent claims.</p>
      <p>The fiscal described how Boyle “hijacked” other people’s personal information.</p>
      <p>She explained: “People received phone calls from someone purporting to be from the Department of Work and Pensions.</p>
      <p>“This person cleared security with them and then took their details.</p>
      <p>“A number of similar claims were then made to the DWP; requests were made to have addresses and telephone numbers changed, and a common telephone number was found in relation to the new claims.</p>

      </p>
      <p>“The method of payment was changed to ‘simple payment’.</p>
      <p>“This is used when a claimant doesn’t have a bank account or is unable to obtain one.</p>
      <p>“A code was sent to Boyle, enabling him to withdraw funds at pay points which are found in hundreds of shops nationwide; he used outlets mainly in Lanarkshire.</p>
      <p>“A number of supposedly different callers to the DWP appeared to have the same voice and Boyle was suspected as the department had his voice on file.</p>
      <p>DWP officials spoke to staff at various outlets and a number of them queried the fact that the same man had been coming in using different identities.</p>
      <p>“This man was Boyle, who had a distinctive tattoo between his thumb and forefinger. He was seen on CCTV footage.”</p>
      <p>Defence agent Rowan Myles said that Boyle carried out the fraud to fund his alcohol and gambling addictions.</p>
      <p>The addictions, he explained, were brought on by the disclosure of “devastating” family news.</p>
      <p>Mr Myles said that his client suffers from depression and pointed out that he has not been in trouble since the fraud came to light more than three years ago.</p>
      <p>He added that Boyle is employed and that he has started paying back the DWP.</p>
      <p>But Sheriff David Bicket said only a prison sentence was appropriate, telling Boyle: “This scheme persisted for more than a year and involved a number of vulnerable people.</p>
      <p>“It was carried out in a thorough and determined manner and it involved a significant amount of money.</p>
      <p>“I appreciate there have been changes [in your life] but the offence is so serious that it can be dealt with only by a custodial sentence.”</p>
      <p>Sheriff Bicket reduced the jail term from two years to 18 months to reflect the fact that, by not going to trial, Boyle had saved the court “considerable” time.</p>
