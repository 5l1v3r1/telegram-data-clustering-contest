        <b>UPDATE 10:50 a.m.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A service member with the Canadian Armed Forces who asked not to be identified tells Castanet he has knowledge of one complaint, involving a female subordinate and Sean David Parker that he came across some time ago. </p>
      <p>"He propositioned this woman for sex and when he was rebuffed, her life was made difficult," the person says.</p>
      <p>The Canadian Armed Forces has taken steps to weed out sexual assault and misconduct in its ranks, releasing the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/corporate/reports-publications/sexual-misbehaviour/external-review-2015.html">Deschamps report</a> in 2015 and starting <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/department-national-defence/services/benefits-military/conflict-misconduct/operation-honour.html">Operation Honour</a> the same year.  Operation Honour is intended to empower CAF members to take a stand against sexual misconduct and encourage exemplary conduct.</p>
      <p>The service member Castanet spoke with said he knew the investigation into child pornography charges was underway while Parker was still Brigade Sergeant Major with 39 Brigade.</p>
      <p>"I'm a service member and I do not care for the fact that the military is allowing him to leave quietly," the person said. "It means that he can still put his name down as Chief Warrant Officer, Retired, keep his medals. He can also move wherever he wants, where people don't know he's committed a crime and be able to use his (former rank and medals) for standing in the community.</p>
      <p>"He committed a crime against the most vulnerable members of our society and to me it's unconscionable."</p>

        <b>UPDATE 10:02 a.m.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Sean David Parker, who pleaded guilty to possession of child pornography Monday, was elevated to the position of Brigade Sergeant Major of the <a href="http://www.army-armee.forces.gc.ca/en/39-cbg/index.page">39 Brigade Grou</a>p, and as such, he was the second-highest-ranking non-Commissioned officer in the B.C. army before he resigned his commission in November of 2018.</p>
      <p>The 39 Canadian Brigade Group recruits, trains, and retains soldiers and leaders to support both domestic and expeditionary operations.</p>
      <p>The brigade group is made up of approximately 1,500 soldiers located in reserve units located in communities across British Columbia. Most of the soldiers in 39 CBG are reservists, serving part-time within their communities.</p>
