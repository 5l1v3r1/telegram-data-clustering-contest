        <b>1xBit.com is an online casino founded in 2016 that offers a variety of gambling games like no other e-gaming platform. Depending on the country you are in, you can access different games including sports bets, lotteries, slot machines and a lot more. In addition, there is a 100% bonus on the first cryptocurrency deposit.</b>

      <h3>iGaming</h3>
      <p>The gambling market is one of the most profitable and attractive markets in the world. Some estimates say that approximately 1.6 billion people gamble during any given year with over 4.2 billion having gambled at one time or another.</p>
      <p>People love to get along with online gambling for different reasons such as alternative games, quick and easy approaches to the casinos with no need to travel, secured privacy, as well as diverse payment options. In recent years, online casinos have therefore seen fit to introduce Bitcoin into their payment options or even have created online casinos where only cryptocurrencies are accepted.</p>
      <p>The latter category includes <a href="https://refpaexhil.top/L?tag=d_304145m_1732c_btc3&amp;site=304145&amp;ad=1732&amp;r=crypto_regs/203/">1xBit</a>, a cryptocurrency gambling platform founded in 2016 which offers a myriad of games to bet on.</p>
      <h4>First Steps and Bonuses</h4>
      <p>Creating an account is quick and easy on 1xBit, once you enter your email you will be able to access all the site’s services. Furthermore, there are several bonuses and features for all registered players.</p>
      <p>First of all, users can profit from 125% bonus on the first deposit (use your <b><i>promo code</i></b> <b><i>BTCM1X</i></b> ) after a minimum deposit of at least 5 mBTC has been made, excitingly the bonus can go up to a whopping 7 BTC. Another interesting promotion is the “Accumulator of the Day” which increases the odds automatically 10% from the regular odds listed on their website.</p>
      <p>By activating this option however, users will have some restrictions such as the inability to use the “bonus” funds or use the “Advancebet” promotion. The latter is a type of bet which is based on the evaluation of the potential returns from your unsettled bets. This means that if you have on-going bets, and the total of the potential winnings bets is larger than what you currently have, you are able to place an Advancebet.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, 1xBit often organizes limited-duration promotions that allow you to participate in multiple games by betting on a category specified by the site.<a href="https://refpaexhil.top/L?tag=d_286525m_1732c_btc4&amp;site=286525&amp;ad=1732&amp;r=promotions/cort/"> The Battle on the Court</a> is currently underway which allows users to obtain lottery tickets if tennis bets are placed. The promotion will be active until November 24.</p>
      <h4>Games</h4>
      <p>1xBit offers a range of games beyond imagination. Bets can be made for almost any sport, both live and not (even e-sports are included in the selection) or you can play classic casino games like slot machines and roulette.</p>
      <p>To make the experience easier and more direct for the end-user, 1xBit allows you to divide sports bets by country, so finding your favorite teams will be almost immediate.</p>
      <p>In addition to betting on future events, 1xBit also has a Live function that allows you to bet on events currently in progress. Gaming enthusiasts will find this service awesome as you can bet on very popular videogames including Tekken, Injustice, PES, Angry Birds and many more.</p>
      <p>The Live Casino section is divided according to the gaming service providers, which currently are nine including Evolution Gaming, MEDIALIVE, and Lucky Streak. The games offered are classical live table games such as Roulette, Blackjack, and Baccarat.</p>
      <p>Finally, we find the 1xGames section dedicated to the most classic games that counts a selection of almost 100 games!</p>
      <p>Lottery games can be found under the “More” tab. Here you are able to choose from two different Lotto games, one would be National Lottery Draws from around the world and the other one would be a Lottery within the website itself.</p>
      <h4>Deposits and Customer Support</h4>
      <p>As previously mentioned, 1xBit falls into the category of those online casinos that do not require personal data to access and only accept cryptocurrency deposits (at the moment the website accepts 25 different cryptocurrencies). They also offer good customer support accessible via 24/7 Live Chat button located on the lower right corner of their home screen, and email support in the section “Contacts” at the bottom of the page.</p>
      <p>For up-to-date information on promotions and site offers, you can follow their various social media profiles on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPAFo4OYJGHCxWlENrdRtWA">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/1x_bit">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/1xbit/">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://t.me/s/sportsbook_1xBit">Telegram</a> and <a href="https://refpaexhil.top/L?tag=d_286525m_1732c_btc5&amp;site=286525&amp;ad=1732&amp;r=blog/">Blog</a>.</p>
      <p>As explained earlier, cryptocurrencies offer a range of benefits over fiat transactions. For starters, users don’t have to share personal or banking information in order to initiate such transactions. Also, players can make near-instant deposits and start playing their game of choice on such platforms. In addition to these advantages, 1xBit offers a wide range of games that are almost inimitable, especially when compared to the standard offerings on platforms.</p>
      <p>Considering the developments of 1xBit, it cannot be ruled out that in the near future they will be able to create a series of blockchain-based services to ensure that there is no way for the system to change the outcome of a bet, making the game provably fair.</p>
