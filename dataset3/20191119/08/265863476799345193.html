      <h1>Jax Taylor Says He Doesn’t Like The New Vanderpump Rules Cast Members — Calls Them Thirsty</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T08:23:55+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 08:23</time> by <a rel="author">Ricki Mathers</a></address>
      <p>Jax Taylor is not mincing words when it comes to the <a href="https://celebrityinsider.org/descriptions-are-here-read-about-the-newbies-coming-to-vanderpump-rules-season-8-340943/">group of newbies joining</a> Vanderpump Rules. The Bravolebrity and his co-stars have deemed some of them ‘thirsty.’</p>
      <p>There was a rumor floating around that VPR freshman Dayna Kathan was actually one of the women that attended a party that Jax was at while Brittany Cartwright was away and that somehow caused drama between her and Brittany.</p>
      <p>So, it’s no wonder that Jax may not be Dayna’s biggest fan if it’s true that she caused a rift in his relationship.</p>
      <p>While at Bravocon, Taylor was asked about the new additions to which he very blatantly told US Weekly: ‘I don’t like the new people. Except for Brett and Max, I really like them. They’re really cool. They’re down to earth. They’re not thirsty. We’ve been around for eight years. You can see a thirsty person coming a mile away. There’s some of them. There’s a few of them.’</p>

      <p>The 40-year-old was referring to Brett Caprioni and Max Boyens which leaves Dayna Kathan, Danica Dow, and Charli Burnett as the parched newcomers.</p>
      <p>Lala Kent also chimed in with: ‘Oh, yeah. Throw them some Aquafina, for real. It’s crazy.’</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Ariana Madix defended the fresh faces by saying that they’re all his friends and Jax is the thirsty one.</p>
      <p>It seems that Katie Maloney is playing the neutral card because she claims the OG’s haven’t had much interaction with them.</p>
      <p>‘The thing is we don’t know a lot of them. When we started this show it was our real group of best friends and these are people that have just met at SUR, they didn’t know each other before so it’s kinds of interesting. It’s a different dynamic because they didn’t have the history that we have. So you can’t really compare us to them.’</p>
      <p>Do you think Jax is jealous?</p>
