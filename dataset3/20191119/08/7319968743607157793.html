        <b>Rose Schlossberg who looks just like her grandmother gives a lesson in apocalypse survival for girls</b>
      </p>
      <p>Rose Schlossberg, the granddaughter of <a href="https://www.irishcentral.com/news/jackie-kennedy-blamed-lyndon-b-johnson-for-jfk-murder-127220093-237788131">Jackie Kennedy</a>, launched her comedy web series in March 2016 and the Internet went crazy.</p>
      <p>Not over the series but over the uncanny resemblance the 29-year-old has to her grandmother. Schlossberg is the eldest child of <a href="https://www.irishcentral.com/news/politics/could-caroline-kennedy-be-the-leader-democrats-need-after-clinton-s-loss">Caroline Kennedy</a>, Jackie O and <a href="https://www.irishcentral.com/roots/history/top-facts-about-president-john-f-kennedy-you-never-knew-232985981-237788811">John F Kennedy</a>’s daughter, and her designer husband Edwin Schlossberg.</p>
      <p>The budding comedian has her grandmother’s brunette hair, delicate smile, wide-set eyes, and slender frame.</p>

      <p>While she certainly shares her grandmother’s good looks the iconic glamor and style the Jackie was known for are not readily evident from her onscreen wardrobe where she wears a messy ponytail, t-shirts, and jeans in the series.</p>

      <p>The Jackie O look-alike, Rose Schlossberg, a Harvard graduated co-launched a six-episode web series, called “End Times Girls Club,” with her friend Mara Nelson-Greenberg. The series, which was inspired by her time at graduate school at <a href="https://www.irishcentral.com/topic/new-york">New York</a> University, is a satirical web series teaching women how to survive the apocalypse.</p>

      <p>Speaking to <a href="https://mashable.com/2016/03/09/end-times-girls-club/">Mashable</a>, the up-and-coming comedian said “It came up as a response to seeing the way that <a href="https://www.irishcentral.com/topic/new-york">New York</a> responded to Hurricane Sandy, and how people were grossly underprepared — specifically, girls in damsel in distress mode.</p>
      <p>“I thought it would be interesting to create this world where girls have to be survivalists without compromising their cute factor.”</p>
      <p>In the series Rose and Mara play the roles of Bee and Lara, two vloggers teaching their viewers how to do everything from a “fun new way to start a fire after the apocalypse” to making mascara using nothing but “ashes and plain old auto grease.”</p>
