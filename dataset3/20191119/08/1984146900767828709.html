      <h2>Kyle Lawson turned up a the house in Alnwick acting aggressively and left the victim needing nine stitches by kicking through the front door</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T08:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Rob Kennedy</a></address>
      <p>Raging Kyle Lawson left his former girlfriend's dad injured by kicking his door in when he was standing behind it.</p>
      <p>Lawson turned up at the house, where his then-partner was staying, furious and acting aggressively.</p>
      <p>As the homeowner stood behind his front door contemplating whether to open it or not, Lawson took a run at it and kicked it so hard he knocked out the centre of the door.</p>
      <p>The victim was left with a wound below his knee which went down to the bone and needed nine stitches.</p>
      <p>Now Lawson, 24, has been jailed for six months for assault occasioning actual bodily harm but he will be released imminently due to the time he has spent on remand.</p>
      <p>Sentencing him at <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-crown-court">Newcastle Crown Court</a>, Mr Justice Martin Spencer said: "You went to the victim's property, where his daughter was then residing, and you started shouting about a missing bank card and about child contact, in an aggressive fashion.</p>
      <p>"You then kicked in the door, which caused him to sustain a serious injury to his knee which required nine sutures and left him with a scar.</p>
      <p>"I accept you may not have appreciated at the time you caused this injury but the altercation continued in the garden."</p>
      <p>The court heard trouble flared at the victim's home in Alnwick on August 18.</p>
      <p>The father and daughter were disturbed by a loud bang and saw Lawson in the garden, shouting aggressively and throwing stones at the window.</p>
      <p>Barry Robson, prosecuting, said: "The victim saw the defendant headbutting a window and inviting him outside for a fight.</p>
      <p>"He saw him kicking at the front door and was worried about what was happening and went to stand behind the front door.</p>
      <p>"He was thinking about opening it to confront him and planned on remonstrating with him but before anything further could occur, he described the door as imploding in on him as he stood behind it and he was grabbed by the defendant and thrown outside and there was a further confrontation in the garden, instigated by the defendant, with his then-partner trying to come between them."</p>
      <p>Lawson then ran away from the scene and the victim realised he had a deep wound under his knee.</p>
      <p>He said in a statement read to the court: "This left me feeling worried.</p>
      <p>"Now, when I go out, I come back and check the property in case he is back causing problems and damage, which has had an adverse effect on me."</p>
      <p>Lawson, of no fixed address, admitted assault on the basis he caused the injury by kicking the door and didn't punch or spit on him. As well as the six month sentence, he was given a three year restraining order not to go near the victim's home.</p>
      <p>The court heard he has 31 previous convictions, including for common assault on his ex, a racially aggravated public order offence in which he verbally abused a shopkeeper and harassment.</p>
      <p>Kate Barnes, defending, said: "He expresses a determination to refrain from offending and they are not hollow words.</p>
      <p>"He has written a letter of apology which he has not been able to forward.</p>
      <p>"He was assaulted himself last year and he wants to move forward in a more positive way."</p>
