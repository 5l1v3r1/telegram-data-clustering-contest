      <p><pic src="https://www.guru3d.com/news_teaserimage/14712"/>The LIQMAX III 360mm top model get an upgrade to addressable RGB LEDs and comes with a RGB controller for stand-alone usage. With tree Dual-Convex RGB fans the cooler achives a TDP of 360W, enabling the LIQMAX III 360 ARGB to cool latest multi-core processors.</p>
      <p>With LIQMAX III ARGB, the successful LIQMAX series now finally receives RGB lighting. The water block with its acrylic look is equipped with the Aurabelt design, which provides brilliant lighting effects. LIQMAX III ARGB supports addressable RGB synchronization with motherboards that have 4-pin addressable (5V/Data/-/GND). Thanks to ENERMAX’s patented Dual-Chamber Design, Central Coolant Inlet (CCI) and Shunt-Channel Technology (SCT) the cooler achieves faster heat transfer and an extended life time. The RGB fans with dual-convex blades are optimized for radiators and generate high static pressure to drive heat out of the cooling fins. The LIQMAX III ARGB is an excellent cooler for gaming cases that do not want to miss RGB lighting.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Dual-Chamber Water Block</b>
      </p>
      <p>The patented Dual-Chamber Design isolates the pump from the heated coolant, extending the life of the cooler.<br/>The cold coolant enters the first chamber with the pump inside and is then forced through the cold plate absorbing heat. The heated coolant is collected in the second chamber and then transported to the radiator for cooling.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Central Coolant Inlet Design</b>
      </p>
      <p>The central coolant inlet (CCI) injects coolant at the hottest point of the CPU increasing the cooling performance. The cold plates Shunt-Channel Technology (SCT) shortens the coolant flow path and results in faster heat transfer.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Aurabelt Water Block</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Aurabelt water block of LIQMAX III ARGB is equipped with addressable RGB LEDs. For stand-alone operation the water block displays the rainbow RGB lighting effect.</p>
      <p>
        <b>RGB Sync</b>
      </p>
      <p>Synchronizable RGB lighting via addressable RGB headers of motherboards from Asus, Asrock, MSI and Gigabyte. Programmable lighting effects via motherboards software. Razer Chroma support with compatible motherboards of Asrock and MSI.</p>
      <p>
        <b>RGB Control Box</b>
      </p>
      <p>The integrated RGB control box offers quick setup of 10 pre-set lighting effects without the need of an RGB motherboard or additional software.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Dual-Convex Blade RGB Fan</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Dual-convex fan blade are a result of precision engineering calculating the shape and angles.</p>
      <p>The fan creates down force air pressure and a high-volume air flow.</p>
      <p>The frame is equipped with rubber pads to reduce the vibration and noise.</p>
      <p>Addressable RGB LEDs at the fan hub provide bright illumination.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Compatibility</b>
      </p>
      <p>Quick &amp; user-friendly universal mounting system supporting Intel® and AMD® sockets (excluding TR4/SP3 socket). The pressure adjustment spring system and high conductive Dow-Corning® thermal grease ensures a perfect contact with the CPUs heat spreader.</p>
      <p>LIQMAX III ARGB is compatible with 120mm fan mountings. Please ensure your case offers enough space to install the radiator.</p>
      <p>
