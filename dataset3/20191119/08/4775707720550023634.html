      <p>The community servers for <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Skate-3/achievements">Skate 3</a> have mysteriously come back online making some achievements obtainable again. An eagle-eyed <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/dy2v2j/skate_3_community_servers_are_back_online_making">Redditor</a> spotted that the servers were live, and we've jumped on to confirm that some achievements are unlocking.</p>
      <p>Eight achievements were previously listed as unobtainable on the Skate 3 achievement list. They are as follows: <br/><a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Skate-3/achievements"><pic src="https://static.trueachievements.com/imagestore/0001686900/1686921.jpg" width="64"

href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Skate-3/achievements">Skate 3</a> worth 67 pointsPlay in a 6-player Team Freeskate session<br/><br/>We have tested in the office and found that <b>Gone Viral</b>, <b>Artsy Fartsy</b> and <b>Constructive Criticism</b> are in fact, unlocking. However, we haven't been able to confirm if any of the other achievements are popping. <b>Team Up</b>, <b>Throw Down</b> and <b>Lot Pwners</b> are team-based achievements that need you and two more players in a team to unlock.<b> Talking bout Team Practice </b>needs six people in a team in a free skate session. Sadly, it looks like the ability to create new teams is down — we couldn't access it. Old teams, however, can still be joined. The Sellout! achievement has a couple of recent unlocks as of November 13, although we again can't confirm that it's working. <b>Sellout!</b> requires you create a custom logo using a graphics creator on the Skate website, however that has long disappeared. There is a workaround detailed in the <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/a60765/sellout-achievement">achievement guides</a> where if you import a friends custom skater to your game, the achievement will unlock.</p>
      <p>It's probably worth setting up a <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Skate-3/sessions">Gaming Session</a> with other TA members to see if these achievements are unlocking. The Skate 3 servers are up and down like a yo-yo — they could go down at a moments notice without any warning like they have done in the past, so it's probably a good idea to grab these achievements quickly.</p>
      <p>Skate 3 is currently in EA Access and made it into our <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/n39644/ea-access-games-on-xbox-one">best games in EA Access list</a>. The community-rated the skateboarding sim a 3.9/5. Fans have been yearning for a sequel, but EA has yet to reveal anything about a potential Skate 4 — it's been almost ten years since Skate 3 was released. EA has been <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/n39609/skate-trademark-cancelled">filing trademarks</a> for the franchise, but until something concrete appears, we will all have to wait. That is unless crea-ture Studios' new skateboarding game, <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game/Session">Session</a> can fill the void when it eventually comes to <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/game-preview/games">Xbox Game Preview</a> in either late November or early December.</p>
      <p>If you do manage to unlock any of the above achievements that we haven't confirmed, let us know in the comments.</p>

I'm Sean. I have been writing gaming content for various outlets over the past few years while studying a degree in Journalism.
