      <h1>Millions who never smoked cigarettes are using other tobacco products</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T08:00:09+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">HealthDay News</a></address>
      <p>Adults who have never smoked traditional cigarettes are being lured into tobacco use by a host of other products, including e-cigarettes, new research shows.</p>
      <p>The study found 1 in 5 adults in the U.S. who had never smoked reported trying non-cigarette tobacco products -- with young adults 18 to 39 reporting the highest prevalence of use.</p>
      <p>"In general, cigarette use has decreased," said Dr. Javier Valero-Elizondo, who led the study. He is a research associate in the Heart Research Center at Houston Methodist Research Institute. "But we are now seeing that use of e-cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos, hookahs and other products are on the rise.</p>
      <p>"This study was about shining a light on a potential problem we didn't previously know the size of."</p>
      <p>Valero-Elizondo presented the preliminary findings Monday at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions in Philadelphia. He conducted the research as a postdoctoral associate at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.</p>
      <p>Valero-Elizondo and his colleagues analyzed data collected on 77,623 never-smokers who were 18 and older taking part in the National Health Interview Survey from 2014 to 2018.</p>
      <p>Among those surveyed, 22 percent reported using at least one non-cigarette tobacco product, suggesting 32.7 million U.S. adults have tried these products.</p>
      <p>In addition, 4.8 percent of the adults surveyed reported currently using non-cigarette tobacco products. This translates into 7.3 million U.S. adults annually.</p>
      <p>These findings "raise concerns regarding the high prevalence of tobacco use among never-cigarette-smokers," said Mary Rezk-Hanna, an assistant professor in the School of Nursing at the University of California, Los Angeles, who was not involved with the research.</p>
      <p>Rezk-Hanna said she would like to see research that follows the users of non-cigarette tobacco products over time to determine whether they eventually take up traditional cigarette smoking.</p>
      <p>Tobacco use remains a leading cause of preventable death in the United States and globally. Experts estimate it accounted for 7.1 million deaths worldwide in 2016.</p>
      <p>Smoking is a major cause of cardiovascular disease, which is the leading cause of death in the U.S., killing more than 800,000 people a year. About 1 in 4 of those deaths are from smoking, according to a 2014 surgeon general's report.</p>
      <p>E-cigarettes, most of which contain nicotine that comes from tobacco, heat a liquid into an aerosol that can be inhaled. In addition to nicotine, the liquid usually has other harmful ingredients such as flavorants and heavy metals.</p>
      <p>In August, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the first death from a vaping-related lung injury. Since then, at least 39 deaths from a vaping-related lung injury have occurred. There also have been at least 2,051 cases of e-cigarette or vaping-related lung injuries reported to the CDC.</p>
      <p>The CDC is working with the Food and Drug Administration, public health officials, scientists and others to determine the cause of the lung injuries linked to e-cigarettes.</p>
      <p>"There are many aspects of this study that are timely with respect to current health concerns about these products," said Rezk-Hanna.</p>
      <p>The findings from the new study can help researchers develop effective non-cigarette tobacco prevention and cessation programs.</p>
      <p>"Our study helps us pinpoint population subgroups where more targeted public heath efforts could be focused," said Valero-Elizondo. "By us describing who is at higher risk for using these products and pairing that with national mortality data and other epidemiology studies on smoking use, we can put together a plan to start a conversation to tackle the problem, help those who are using these products quit, and keep those haven't started from using them at all."</p>
