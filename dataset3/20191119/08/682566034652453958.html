      <h1>Elgar's white ball skills 'on another level' - Klaasen</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T08:16:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 08:16</time> by <a rel="author">Lloyd Burnard - Sport24</a></address>
      <p>Cape Town - <b>Dean Elgar</b> has been a mainstay of the <b>Proteas</b> top order for over <b>five</b> years in Test cricket.</p>
      <p>Now 32, he has carved out a reputation for himself as one of the grittiest opening batsmen on the world Test stage with several bulldog-like knocks for the national side in some seriously trying situations. </p>
      <p>On the toughest wickets, Elgar battles through bouncers and bruises and ensures that bowlers must earn his wicket. </p>
      <p>He loves batting for long periods, and that has translated into <b>12 </b>Test centuries, the last of which came in the first Test against India in Visakhapatnam when his <b>160</b> resulted in a standing ovation in a losing cause. </p>
      <p>With Aiden Markram struggling for form, Elgar's role for the upcoming four-Test series against England over the festive period has become crucial.</p>
      <p>His white ball credentials, however, have almost always been overlooked. </p>
      <p>Elgar has always said that he wants to play ODI cricket for his country, but since making his debut in the format back in 2012 he has notched up just <b>8 </b>caps.</p>
      <p>He was given a brief window in 2018 to make a play at the 2019 World Cup squad, but scores of <b>2 </b>and <b>4</b> against Zimbabwe saw that experiment ditched immediately by Proteas management. </p>
      <p>On Sunday in Paarl, though, Elgar provided a glimpse of what could have been with a superb <b>88* (60)</b> to help the Tshwane Spartans chase down the 186 they needed for victory against the Paarl Rocks in the Mzansi Super League (MSL). </p>
      <p>Elgar was brilliant from start to finish, showing that you don't need to be the longest hitter to score quickly in T20 cricket. </p>
      <p>He was innovative, moving around the crease to manufacture space for himself, and he never once looked flustered under the pressures of the chase. </p>
      <p>Elgar displayed the same composure he does in Test cricket and he proved that he is more than capable of getting the job done in ODIs and T20s too.</p>
      <p>"I saw before the tournament started that he was my guy that everyone needed to look out for," Spartans captain Heinrich Klaasen said of Elgar after Sunday's match.</p>
      <p>"Everyone has pigeonholed him as a Test player, but his white ball skills are on a different level as well.</p>
      <p>"He has just never had the opportunity to play a lot of white ball cricket in South Africa. I'm very happy for him. He deserves it and it couldn't have happened to a better person.</p>
      <p>"Hopefully he can continue it for us for the next seven games."</p>
      <p>Elgar and the Spartans are next in action when they host the Durban Heat at Centurion on Thursday night. </p>
