      <p>Kirksville, Mo. — November 16 was the start of Missouri’s firearms deer season and one health care provider wants you to stay safe this season.</p>
      <p>Speaking with Dr. Jacob Quick, trauma surgeon for MU Health Care, he’s seen an average of 30 major hunting accidents happen every year.</p>
      <p>But some key precautions can limit a hunter’s risk of injury.</p>
      <p>Quick is a hunter and says gunshot injuries are rare. We wanted to know what the injuries he sees the most.</p>
      <blockquote>“We see everything from orthopedic injuries like broken legs and arms to intra-abdominal injuries – injuries to the bowel, liver, spleen, kidneys, those kinds of things - to chest injuries. You name it, it can happen," said Quick.</blockquote>
      <p>Most of the injuries occur after a hunter falls from a tree stand and according to Quick, 30% of all hunters will fall and suffer a serious injury at some point.</p>
      <p>That can be easily avoided, as 80% of those falls come from hunters who don’t wear a harness.</p>
      <p>Other than wearing a full body harness, Quick says hunters should keep 3 limbs in contact with the ladder at all times, make sure someone knows your location and always carry your cellphone.</p>
      <p>Missouri firearms deer season runs through November 26. For more tips, <a href="https://www.muhealth.org/our-stories/tips-staying-safe-while-hunting">click here</a>.</p>
