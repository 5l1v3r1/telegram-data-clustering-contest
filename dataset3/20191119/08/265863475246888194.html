      <h1>Taylor Swift Can Perform Her Oldies At AMA’s Says Big Machine Label Group And Dick Clark Productions</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T08:47:33+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 08:47</time> by <a rel="author">Ricki Mathers</a></address>
      <p>Taylor Swift may have a long fight ahead of her, but for now, she has won a small battle. The pop singer is free and clear to perform whatever songs she pleases according to Big Machine Records — and the law.</p>
      <p>Taylor’s raging feud with Scooter Braun and Scott Borcheta caused the 29-year-old to <a href="https://celebrityinsider.org/taylor-swift-blasts-scooter-braun-and-scott-borchata-for-blocking-her-ama-performance-and-netflix-documentary-source-claims-she-owes-them-7-million-340997/">call on her Swifties for support</a> after she revealed that she was told that she couldn’t perform any of her old music from her albums before Lover at the American Music Awards nor could she use them in an upcoming Netflix special.</p>
      <p>Her fans, along with many other people in the music industry, publicly urged Big Machine Label Group to do the right thing.</p>
      <p>However, many people pointed out that as far as live performances — Big Machine could not ban her from doing them unless she was planning to record and distribute them before her contract is up.</p>

      <p>But if that’s not enough reassurance, Big Machine Label Group and Dick Clark Productions released a joint statement that read: ‘The Big Machine Label Group and Dick Clark Productions announce that they have come to terms on a licensing agreement that approves their artists’ performances to stream post show and for re-broadcast on mutually approved platforms. This includes the upcoming American Music Awards performances for Thomas Rhett and former Big Machine Records recording artist Taylor Swift.’</p>
      <p>They went on to say that it should be noted that no artist needs label approval for a live performance or any other live media.</p>
      <p>The statement also read: ‘Record label approval is only needed for contracted artists’ audio and visual recordings and in determining how those works are distributed.’</p>
      <p>There is still some confusion as to if this is true or not according to sources close to Taylor’s camp.</p>
      <p>An insider claims that the songwriter has completely changed her planned set due to this dispute.</p>
