      <h2>Walsall winger Wes McDonald has insisted he wants to earn a new contract to stay at Saddlers.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T08:32:25+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 08:32</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/liam-keen/" target="_blank">Liam Keen</a></address>
      <p>The 22-year-old joined in the summer on a short-term deal until January.</p>
      <p>After a slow start, his recent scintillating performances have made him a fan-favourite as he fights to earn a new deal.</p>
      <p>“I’m taking it day by day, training hard and every time I get on the pitch on a match day I want to try and impress the gaffer and the club and show what I can do,” he said. “Of course (I want to stay). I like the club, it’s a great club, a family club and I want to keep going and pushing.</p>
      <p>“I just want to get on the pitch as much as possible. I’m glad the gaffer has shown faith in me.</p>
      <p>“I tried to be positive all the time when I have the ball.”</p>
      <p>McDonald is one of three players on deals until January, alongside Luke Little and Jack Kiersey.</p>
      <p>At the beginning of the month the club were still mulling over their future.</p>
      <p>Now, manager Darrell Clarke has said he is ‘pleased’ with McDonald, but didn’t indicate whether a new deal was likely.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been really pleased with Wes, really pleased with him,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I think he’s done well and did well the other night.</p>
      <p>“We want to make him better though, like all of our players.</p>
      <p>“There’s times where he looks so dangerous going forward, taking players on, and there’s times where he’s got two or three men on him and he’s got to pass the ball and make other players available to get on the ball.</p>
      <p>“But really pleased, he’s a great lad with a great attitude.</p>
      <p>“No problems with him.”</p>
      <p>After a goal and assist away to Crawley in September, fans were quick to identify McDonald as one of their most exciting forwards.</p>
      <p>After a spell out of the team, McDonald has put in two excellent performances against Forest Green Rovers and Cambridge and has thanks fans for their support.</p>
      <p>“I really appreciate all the support,” he added.</p>
      <p>“The fans, home and away, are always giving me support every time I get on the pitch.</p>
      <p>“They’re shouting my name, always giving me great encouragement, it’s very appreciated.”</p>
