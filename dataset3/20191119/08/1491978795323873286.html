      <p>The merger between the owners of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/newzealand">New Zealand</a> Herald and the country’s most popular news website Stuff is back on the table two years after it was rejected by the high court.</p>
      <p>New Zealand Herald publisher NZME has confirmed it is in talks with <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/channel-nine">Nine Entertainment</a>, which put Stuff up for sale after it took control of Fairfax Media last year.</p>
      <p>Stuff <a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/117534515/kiwishare-model-mooted-to-protect-journalism-in-new-nzmestuff-takeover-bid?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">reported that a “Kiwishare” model</a>, which would purportedly protect New Zealand journalism and jobs by keeping the media properties separate, may be the key to getting the merger across the line this time.</p>
      <p>NZME, or New Zealand Media and Entertainment, is a large media company with radio, digital, e-commerce and print brands which reaches an audience of 3.2m.</p>

      <p>Nine Entertainment <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/apr/30/nine-sells-160-former-fairfax-regional-newspapers-for-115m">sold 160 former Fairfax regional papers</a>, including the Canberra Times and the Illawarra Mercury, to the former Domain boss Antony Catalano and investors for $115m in April, but has been unable to offload Stuff, which does not form part of its national strategy.</p>
      <p>Nine Entertainment declined to comment on reports it was in talks with NZME.</p>
      <p>NZME, which owns the Herald newspaper as well as a slew of local papers and radio stations, told the NZX/ASX it had put a proposal to the government regarding a possible transaction but cautioned it was early days.</p>
      <p>“NZME confirms that it is in discussions with Stuff’s owners Nine and has put a proposal to the government regarding a possible transaction,” <a href="https://www.nzx.com/announcements/344538">the note said</a>.</p>
      <p>“However, NZME notes that these discussions are preliminary and stresses that no decision has been made in relation to any potential transaction.</p>
      <p>“There can be no certainty at this stage that these discussions will result in any transaction.</p>
      <p>“NZME remains in compliance with its continuous disclosure obligations and will provide further information to the market as required.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/19/new-zealand-merger-print-media-companies-blocked-high-court">The high court rejected</a> the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/11/new-zealand-one-major-newspaper-group-merger-talks-revealed">proposed merger</a> in 2017, saying it would have concentrated media ownership to such a degree that it threatened the country’s democracy. The two media companies would have controlled 90% of the nation’s media.</p>
      <p>The high court knockback followed a rejection by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2017/may/03/new-zealand-media-merger-watchdog-blocks-tie-up-of-biggest-print-companies">the Commerce Commission</a> of the proposed merger on similar grounds. The commission said it would have threatened media plurality.</p>
      <p>“We consider that it is appropriate to attribute material importance to maintaining media plurality,” Justice Robert Dobson said.</p>
      <p>“It can claim status as a fundamental value in a modern democratic society … The risk is clearly a meaningful one and, if it occurred, it would have major ramifications for the quality of <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/newzealand">New Zealand</a> democracy.”</p>
      <p>A combined media company would include a number of print titles, the country’s biggest digital news site and several radio stations.</p>
