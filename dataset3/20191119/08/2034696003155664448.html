      <p>Rapper <a href="https://www.nme.com/artists/lil-reese">Lil Reese</a> has given fans an update on his health following a shooting incident which left him in a “critical condition.”</p>
      <p>As first reported by <a href="https://abc7chicago.com/chicago-rapper-lil-reese-shot-critically-injured-in-county-club-hills/5691163/">ABC News Chicago</a>, the rapper, real name Tavares Taylor, was shot in the neck last week (November 11) when his vehicle stopped at an intersection in the County Club Hills, Illinois.</p>
      <p>Witnesses reported seeing a male suspect exit a separate vehicle and then shoot Taylor with “a small rifle” before fleeing, according to <a href="https://abc7chicago.com/chicago-rapper-lil-reese-shot-critically-injured-in-county-club-hills/5691163/"><i>Consequence of Sound.</i></a></p>
