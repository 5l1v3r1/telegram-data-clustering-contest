      <h1>Emre Can takes strange swipe at Italian youngsters who make him ‘angry’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T08:51:36+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 08:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/jordanchamberlain/" target="_blank">Jordan Chamberlain</a></address>
      <p>Emre Can is not enjoying life in Italy, especially since Maurizio Sarri took over in the summer.</p>
      <p>The German has fallen down the pecking order since the arrival of Aaron Ramsey and Adrien Rabiot on Bosman deals not dissimilar to his the year previous.</p>
      <p>In total, Can has played 151 minutes of Serie A football and zero in the Champions League – a very poor return from a German international who aged 25 – should be in his prime.</p>
      <p>And in an odd interview, Can has criticised Juventus youngsters who get the chance to train with the first-team, stating their attitudes are poor.</p>
      <p>
        <b>“They have the chance of a lifetime if they are allowed to practice with the professionals,” he told German outlet Kicker, translated by the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/emre-can-liverpool-juventus-news-17275588">Echo</a>.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“However, some of them sometimes have a body language that almost makes me angry.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“I often go to these players at Juventus, talk to them, try to show them what they can do when they try hard and show themselves. But some don’t understand it.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>It must be frustrating to see talented youth players not displaying appropriate respect or effort – but it seems a strange thing to air in the press.</p>
      <p>Can will surely seek an exit soon unless his situation doesn’t improve, with Manchester United recently credited with an interest by the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/emre-can-speaks-out-juventus-20906625">Mirror</a>.</p>
      <p>It will be a tad uncomfortable seeing Can line up for our bitter rivals, but in reality – it shouldn’t bother us. His exit meant we signed Fabinho, a far, far better player who has improved our midfield tenfold.</p>
      <p>The only person who should regret the departure is Can himself.</p>
