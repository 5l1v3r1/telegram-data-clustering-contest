      <p>The Lagos State Government has sealed off 10 buildings in  Ikoyi and Lekki  for allegedly violating the building control laws of the state.</p>
      <p>Officials of the Lagos State Building Control Agency led by the General Manager, Abiola Kosegbe, stormed the areas at the weekend to effect the closure of the structures.</p>
      <p>Five buildings under construction were sealed off at Osborne Foreshore, Phase II Estate in Ikoyi for not allegedly having building permits and other documents. Others were sealed off  in Lekki for the same reasons..</p>
      <p>Kosegbe said the  state government would not spare any owners of unapproved  structures.</p>
      <p>She said the buildings contravened the urban and regional planning laws of the state and that the owners must get the right  documents before they would be reopened.</p>
      <p>Kosegbe warned that any worker found working on a building sealed off by the agency would be prosecuted.</p>
      <p>The GM, however, appealed to the public, especially  developers, to support the agency in achieving the policy thrust of the Babajide Sanwo-Olu  government.</p>
