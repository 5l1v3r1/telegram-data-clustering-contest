        <b>Jada Pinkett Smith was overwhelmed with emotion while recalling how her close friend, Tupac Shakur, felt ‘threatened’ by the thought of their friendship breaking down.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It’s no secret that the Girls Trip actress had a very close friendship with Tupac, who died in September 1996 at the age of 25 following a drive-by shooting.</p>
      <p>They were the best of friends while studying at Baltimore <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/school/">School</a> of the Arts before finding fame separately.</p>
      <p>According to Jada, the California Love rapper feared they would drift apart as he found ‘stability’ in their friendship.</p>
      <p>Jada, 47, tearfully opened up about Tupac in the episode of Red Table Talk featuring Whitney Houston’s lover Robyn Crawford.</p>
      <p>‘I understood because of the complex relationship I’ve had with ‘Pac and those moments of “Who’s that?” Knowing damn well there ain’t nothing like that between us.</p>

      <p>‘Him feeling like, “You’re the only stability I got, I can’t afford for you to put that attention elsewhere”,’ Jada explained.</p>
      <p>‘For him, it was, we were an anchor for each other. Anytime he felt like that anchor was threatened, oh my God.’</p>

      <p>When Robyn mentioned Whitney’s death in 2012, Jada said of her guest’s new memoir: ‘When you said [the book is] a love letter to Whitney, that resonated as so powerful. It was so healing for me in so many different ways.</p>
      <p>‘It’s hard to live with someone who has had a legacy at the level she has had and then to lose them under tragic circumstances. I have a very similar situation.’</p>

      <p>The Gotham star said: ‘If ‘Pac was still alive, we would probably talk about everything.</p>
      <p>‘He would probably live on that show. I know him. He would be like, “Yo, we gotta talk about this, this week, did you see what happened? We gotta go to Sweden, did you see A$AP [Rocky]? They got him all locked up, we got to go”.’</p>
      <p>She added: ‘I’d probably have to do a Red Table Talk specifically for ‘Pac.</p>

      <p>‘I’d probably do a male version of Red Table Talk with ‘Pac. I would have done that with him because he would have just been so great for something like that.</p>
      <p>‘So maybe we would do the Red Table and the Blue Table for him.’</p>
