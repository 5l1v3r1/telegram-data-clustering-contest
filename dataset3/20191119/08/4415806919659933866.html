      <h1>'Any authoritative figure could pose a threat' - Call for pathway to residency for undocumented immigrants</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T08:51:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 08:51</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>The Government is being called on to provide a pathway to residency for the thousands of undocumented young people in Ireland.</p>
      <p>The Migrant Rights Centre says up to 3,000 people are missing out on travel, an education, and a career because of the issue.</p>
      <p>The group is presenting an open letter signed by 4,000 people to Justice Minister Charlie Flanagan today in an effort to highlight the problem.</p>
      <p>Youth worker with MRCI, Mairead McDevitt, says their human rights are being denied:</p>
      <p>"If they are the victims of a crime or abuse, they feel they can't report it.</p>
      <blockquote>The fear of deportation over their shoulders is too heavy that they don't seek help because any authoritative figure could pose a potential threat.</blockquote>
      <p>"Their lives are quite clandestine," she added.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Immigrant Council of Ireland has described Verona Murphy's comments on asylum seekers as "outrageous."</p>
      <p>The Wexford by-election candidate has apologised twice after remarks made in separate interviews about asylum seekers.</p>
      <p>She described her statement that asylum seekers may need to be "de-programmed" as a poor choice of words.</p>
      <p>Ms Murphy has since visited a Direct Provision centre in Waterford, to gain a better understanding of asylum and refugee issues.</p>
