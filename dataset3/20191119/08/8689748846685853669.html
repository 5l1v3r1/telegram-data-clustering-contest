      <h1>Rev. Obofour invokes generational curse on the editor who doctored his blasphemous viral footage</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T08:20:04+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 08:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.ghbase.com/author/adu/" target="_blank">Adu Sarpeah</a></address>
      <p>Yesterday, November 18, 2019, your favorite entertainment portal, <a href="http://ghbase.com/">ghbase.com</a> reported that <b>Kwaku Agyei Antwi </b>popularly known as Rev. Obofour <a href="http://www.ghbase.com/video-never-in-my-pastoral-job-will-i-work-for-god-to-take-the-glory-rev-obofour-vows/">has stated categorically that never in his pastoral job will he work for God to take the glory.</a></p>
      <p>In the publication, we stated that it’s not clear what triggered Obofour’s outburst against God but taking into consideration <b>his demeanour in the viral footage</b>, he seems serious with his weird or better still blasphemous proclamation.</p>

      <p>But the truth is, most ardent followers of Rev. Obofour affectionately called <a href="http://www.ghbase.com/obofour-episode-4-avram-moshe-gives-a-strict-warning-to-rev-obofour-over-his-new-moniker-iron-boy/">“Iron Boy”</a> were a bit skeptical in reference to the truth or whatsoever of the viral video as the content is nothing but blasphemous.</p>
      <p>Lo and behold, <a href="http://www.ghbase.com/rev-obofour-paid-me-gh%c2%a25000-for-performing-in-his-church-fameye/">Rev. Obofour </a>has added his voice to the ongoing buzz and his reaction is brutally uncensored as he has cursed the entire generation of the editor who doctored his blasphemous viral footage just to taint his reputation.</p>
      <p>In the voice of Rev. Obofour, the viral video has been doctored or better still edited by the anonymous editor who was perhaps hired by his colleague man of God to bring him down.</p>
