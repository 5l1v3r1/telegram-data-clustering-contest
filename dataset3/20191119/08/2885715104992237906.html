      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T08:24:52+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 08:24</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/agency/pti/" target="_blank">PTI</a></address>
      <p>Two IIT-Madras students, who had embarked on an indefinite ‘hunger strike’ following the <a href="https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/chennai/class-topper-in-all-subjects-but-one-iit-madras-student-kills-self-6116836/"><b>death of a girl student</b></a> announced withdrawal of their protest on Tuesday following assurance from the management to meet their key demands.</p>
      <p>“We have called off the (hunger) strike,” Azhar Moideen, a final year Humanities student, told PTI.</p>
      <p>They had launched the indefinite fast on the campus, demanding an internal inquiry into the conduct of faculty as sought by the family of a woman student who committed suicide recently.</p>
      <p>The fast was called off following assurance from the Dean that two of their demands would be implemented “at the earliest,” while that for a probe into the conduct of faculty would be discussed with the Director later, he said.</p>

      <p>The Director was currently not in town and this subject came under his jurisdiction, Moideen said quoting the Dean.</p>
      <p>Moideen said the Dean has sent a mail to all the students, assuring their demands for setting up complaints and redressal system in every department would be implemented “at the earliest”, besides a study on external issues faced by the students at the premier technical varsity.</p>
      <p>Moideen and another student had embarked on an indefinite fast on Monday, following the alleged suicide of Fathima Latheef, a first-year Humanities student hailing from Kerala.</p>
