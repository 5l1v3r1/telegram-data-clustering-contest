      <h1>Thailand is expected to expand less than expected in 2019 – UOB</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T08:53:56+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 08:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/pablo-piovano" target="_blank">Pablo Piovano</a></address>
      <p>UOB Group’s Economist Barnabas Gan reviewed the recent GDP figures in Thailand.</p>
      <h3>Key Quotes</h3>
      <p>“Thailand’s economy expanded at 2.4% y/y in 3Q19, up from 2.3% in 2Q19 but below what markets were expecting. The gain has been led by an acceleration in government consumption and gross fixed capital formation, as well as a widening trade surplus”.</p>
      <p>“Agriculture production led the advance with a 1.5% y/y growth, while the services cluster has expanded further by 3.8% in 3Q19. However, the sustained contraction in the manufacturing space caused the overall industrial cluster to contract 0.3% y/y, the first negative print since 1Q14”.</p>
      <p>“<b>We downgrade our full-year growth outlook to 2.6% (from a previous 2.8% expectation)</b>, in line with the growth downgrade penciled by the National Economic and Social Development Council (NESDC) to the above-mentioned pace. While we find comfort in the improving trade balance, the contraction in the manufacturing and trade clusters seen to-date remain to be key drags to overall growth into the quarters ahead”.</p>
