      <h1>Piers Morgan hints he'll quit Good Morning Britain at end of year</h1>
      <h2>But is he really on the way out?</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T08:11:32+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 08:11</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Leigh</a></address>
      <p>Good Morning Britain host <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/piers-morgan/">Piers Morgan</a> has hinted yet again he could be soon leaving the ITV breakfast show.</p>
      <p>Last week the 54-year-old indicated his future on <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/good-morning-britain/">GMB</a> should not be taken for granted after he suggested contract negotiations might be necessary to extend his stay.</p>
      <p>Discussing <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/jeremy-kyle-show/itv-finally-confirms-the-jeremy-kyle-show-replacement/">the new changes to ITV's daytime schedule</a> with fellow host Susanna Reid on Monday, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/good-morning-britain/piers-morgan-admits-future-on-gmb-isnt-certain-as-itv-extends-show/">he teased his professional services had not been secured to accommodate an extra half hour on the box every morning</a>.</p>
      <p>"The show has been extended until 9 o’clock and let’s just say I haven’t been secured for that period yet," Piers said.</p>

      <p>Susanna replied: "This is when you do your contract negotiations live on air."</p>
      <p>And Piers continued: "I prefer to be honest. So, we'll see."</p>
      <aside>They voted for the one they think might still be here in January.</aside>
      <p>However, Piers seemingly upped the ante by giving a sign he may not be around in 2020.</p>
      <p>After Susanna claimed she had the backing of the show's production team in a debate about which of them would make the better Prime Minister, Piers sulkily implied he'll be off.</p>

      <p>"They voted for the one they think might still be here in January," he fired back.</p>
      <p>"They always think long term on this show. Always looking after each other."</p>
      <p>But Susanna jubilantly responded: "[They want] Someone who’s a stayer! Someone who’s got stamina! Someone who’s not going to leave at the drop of a hat!"</p>
      <p>In October, <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/piers-morgan/piers-morgan-mocks-petition-to-have-him-sacked-from-good-morning-britain/">a petition demanding the former newspaper editor's sacking</a> racked up thousands of signatures.</p>
