      <h3>Why it’s interesting</h3>
      <p>Homeserve cited a strong performance in its membership businesses, such as heating, ventilation and air conditioning services.</p>
      <p>It saw strong profit growth in the US, where customer numbers have hit 4.2m, as well as the UK, where operating profit rose 38 per cent to £14m, over its half-year.</p>
      <p>Revenue from trade review site Checkatrade also grew 34 per cent, with a 28 per cent jump in website visitors to 11.5m.</p>
      <p>The firm also agreed to buy 79 per cent of eLocal for around $140m as a way to expand its presence in the US.</p>
      <p>Homeserve has also appointed a new senior independent director in Katrina Cliffe to replace outgoing non-executive director Stella David.</p>
      <p>Cliffe is currently a non-executive director of Cembra Money Bank, London and Country Mortgages Limited and Majestic Wine.</p>
      <h3>What Homeserve said</h3>
      <p>Richard Harpin, founder and group chief executive, said:</p>
      <blockquote>I am very pleased with our financial performance and strategic progress in the first half of this year. All of our Membership businesses performed well, with North America continuing to deliver strong growth, and interesting opportunities in all our European businesses to develop new partnerships, harness new technology and continue to improve customer service and efficiency. Our buy-and-build approach to HVAC added five profitable new acquisitions and will become a significant business line for us for the first time this year. In Home Experts, we have another business line with global appeal. Checkatrade and Habitissimo are both market leaders and in eLocal, we have agreed to acquire a majority stake in a high growth business which gives us a profitable entry into Home Experts in North America.</blockquote>
