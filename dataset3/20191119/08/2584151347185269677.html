      <h1>EU holds firm on West Bank settlements as US eases stance</h1>
      <h2>Federica Mogherini says the bloc’s position on Israel’s settlement policy ‘remains unchanged.’</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T08:16:05+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 08:16</time> by <a rel="author">Zoya Sheftalovich</a></address>
      <p>The EU's position on Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank has not changed, the bloc's foreign policy chief said on Monday, after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2019/11/18/pompeo-israel-policy-settlements-071382">announced</a> the Trump administration would ease its stance toward Israel.</p>
      <p>Federica Mogherini, the EU’s high representative for foreign affairs, said in a statement: “The European Union’s position on Israeli settlement policy in the occupied Palestinian territory is clear and remains unchanged: all settlement activity is illegal under international law and it erodes the viability of the two-state solution and the prospects for a lasting peace.”</p>
      <p>Mogherini continued: "The EU calls on Israel to end all settlement activity, in line with its obligations as an occupying power," adding that the bloc "will continue to support a resumption of a meaningful process towards a negotiated two-state solution, the only realistic and viable way to fulfill the legitimate aspirations of both parties."</p>
      <p>The EU's statement came after Pompeo said the U.S. was rejecting a 1978 State Department legal opinion that called Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank “inconsistent with international law.”</p>
      <p>"The conclusion that we will no longer recognize as per se inconsistent with international law is based on the unique facts, history, and circumstances prevented by the establishment of civilian settlements in the West Bank," Pompeo said on Monday.</p>
      <p>He added that Israeli courts were capable of resolving disputes on the legality of individual settlements, but warned the policy shift should not be viewed as America "prejudging the ultimate status of the West Bank."</p>
