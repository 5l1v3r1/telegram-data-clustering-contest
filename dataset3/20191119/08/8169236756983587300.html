        <b>A neutral fan tried an experiment on his YouTube channel, and his findings were pretty shocking.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Watch below as this fan goes on stadium tours at both Celtic and Rangers, but each time wearing the colours of their fierce rivals.</p>

      <p>Next, he dons a Rangers shirt and goes for a stadium tour at Celtic, who are far more welcoming and actually let him into the ground!</p>
      <p>The difference here could not be more stark, and it’s pretty damning just how he was treated by club officials at Rangers.</p>
