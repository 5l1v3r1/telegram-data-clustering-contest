      <h3>Glen Johnson has been impressed with Reece James’ recent performances in the Chelsea FC team.</h3>
      <p>The Blues youngster has been given a chance to shine in the Blues first-team over the past couple of weeks.</p>
      <p>James scored Chelsea FC’s equaliser in a 4-4 draw with 10-man Ajax in the Champions League at Stamford Bridge.</p>
      <p>The 19-year-old’s finish was his first Champions League goal after being promoted to first-team affairs by Frank Lampard.</p>
      <p>The Chelsea FC boss placed his faith in James by giving him a starting spot against Crystal Palace in their last Premier League game.</p>
      <p>James impressed as he kept Wilfried Zaha at bay to contribute to the west London side’s 2-0 win against Chelsea FC.</p>
      <p>Johnson arrived at Chelsea FC at the age of 19 following a big-money move from West Ham United in 2003.</p>
      <p>He struggled to make the right-back spot his own amid competition from Paulo Ferreira, who arrived a year later.</p>
      <p>Former Chelsea FC right-back Johnson is expecting big things from James.</p>
      <p>“I know people speak very highly of Reece James at Chelsea and I saw his goal against Ajax,” Johnson told the <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/1204059/Liverpool-news-Trent-Alexander-Arnold-Aaron-Wan-Bissaka-Reece-James-Glen-Johnson">Daily Express</a>.</p>
      <p>“He wouldn’t be in the team if he wasn’t living up to his potential and I hear he’s a great lad as well.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully he can continue his form and keep the shirt.”</p>
      <p>James scored three times in 46 games in all competitions during a season-long loan at Wigan Athletic last term.</p>
      <p>The Blues defender has netted two goals in nine games so far this term after the teenager netted in a resounding League Cup win over Grimsby Town.</p>
