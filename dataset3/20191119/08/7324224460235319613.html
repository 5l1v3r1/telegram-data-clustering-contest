      <h1>Nathan Ferguson is playing West Brom waiting game</h1>
      <h2>He joined the club when he was just eight years old and has enjoyed an outstanding start to the campaign.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T08:54:25+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 08:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/joseph-masi/" target="_blank">Joseph Masi</a></address>
      <p>But it’s difficult to know where Nathan Ferguson will be playing his football next season – despite a new five-year-deal being on the table at The Hawthorns.</p>
      <p>When news first broke the 19-year-old had been offered fresh terms, it seemed it would only be a matter of time before he signed.</p>
      <p>That was back in September – and since then it’s all gone very quiet.</p>
      <p>Tottenham, Crystal Palace, Juventus and Atletico Madrid have all been linked with the defender, who is out of contract in the summer.</p>
      <p>The two Premier League sides certainly need a right-back.</p>
      <p>But it’s the interest of the two foreign clubs that is particularly interesting – and is the reason why a host of other promising youngsters at Albion have also been linked with moves away.</p>
      <p>Fifa compensation tariffs mean teenagers can move abroad for very little.</p>
      <p>Albion have already had it with Louie Barry who – as a 16-year-old – left to join Barcelona for just £235,000.</p>
      <p>And if Ferguson moves abroad, the Baggies will again receive less than £300,000.</p>
      <p>Those fees – minimal in football terms – make the players very attractive to European clubs.</p>
      <p>Not only are they cheap, the buying clubs also know there are huge margins to be made selling the player back to an English club in the future.</p>
      <p>But the fees also make it very easy for an agent to move their client on.</p>
      <p>Agents tend to earn more in fees when the transfer fee is low. They also know if their client doesn’t settle or isn’t a success abroad, it is highly likely an English club will bring them back to these shores.</p>
      <p>It is possible of course that a player – Ferguson or otherwise – may just want to play abroad.</p>
      <p>Jadon Sancho has certainly been a huge success since leaving Manchester City for Borussia Dortmund.</p>
      <p>But using Ferguson’s case as an example, the fact he has been linked with Juventus and Atletico Madrid also helps Tottenham and Palace.</p>
      <p>The reality is Albion have to sell the defender in January if he doesn’t sign a new deal. They cannot simply let a multi-million pound asset walk out the door.</p>
      <p>But clubs can use that interest to drive down the price knowing full well the Baggies won’t want to settle for Fifa’s compensation figure.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, the decision is Ferguson’s. And if he believes he will develop into a better playing by moving on, he has that right.</p>
      <p>But at Albion, he has a manager in Slaven Bilic who trusts him. He has a lucrative contract on the table.</p>
      <p>He is also likely to be playing first-team football and can continue to be surrounded by his friends and family who live in the West Midlands.</p>
      <p>It should have to be a heck of an offer to get him to leave.</p>
      <p>Sadly, though, money talks in football.</p>
      <p>And Fifa’s compensation rule means he is likely to be offered a huge amount of money to move on.</p>
