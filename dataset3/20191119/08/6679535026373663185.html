      <h2>A video explainer on why students are protesting at Jawaharlal Nehru University and what their demands are</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T08:18:35+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 08:18</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/The-Hindu-Net-Desk-248/" target="_blank">The Hindu Net Desk</a></address>
      <p>Students of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) have been protesting for nearly three weeks against the draft hostel manual, which has provisions for hostel fee hike, dress code and curfew timings.</p>
      <p>The JNU Students’ Union (JNUSU) has demanded a complete rollback of the hostel manual.</p>
      <p>The JNU administration’s rationale for the hike is that the fee hasn’t been revised for 19 years. While the JNUSU has cited the university’s annual reports to suggest that more than 40% of the students come from lower-income groups and cannot afford the hike.</p>
      <p>The new hostel charges require students to pay a service charge of Rs. 1,700 per month which previously did not exist. Rent for a single room has been increased from Rs. 20 per month to Rs. 600 per month. Rent for a double-sharing room has increased from Rs. 10 per month to Rs. 300 per month.</p>
      <p>On November 11 protestors reached just outside the convocation hall where Vice-President Venkaiah Naidu was the chief guest. The students also attempted to march to the Parliament on November 18 where the first Winter Parliament session was held.</p>
