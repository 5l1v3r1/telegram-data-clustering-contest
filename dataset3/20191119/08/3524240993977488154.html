      <p>Okechukwu Nnodim, Abuja</p>
      <p>The current open market price for Premium Motor Spirit, popularly known as petrol is N163.68 per litre, the Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency stated on Monday.</p>
      <p>PPPRA stated on its website that the price of PMS as of November 15, 2019 was N163.68/litre, in contrast to the regulated pump price of N145/litre for which the commodity is sold at filling stations.</p>
      <p>This implies that the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, which currently is the sole importer of petrol into Nigeria, might be subsidising the commodity by N18.68/litre.</p>
      <p>In its Petroleum Products Pricing Template released on Monday, the PPPRA explained that the landing cost of petrol was N147.95 per litre.</p>
      <p>It put total distribution margins for the product at N19.37 per litre, making the total cost of the open market price of petrol to be N163.68 per litre.</p>
