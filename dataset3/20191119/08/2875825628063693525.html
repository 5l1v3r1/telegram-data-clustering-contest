      <p>Caitlyn Jenner can be the first American winner of I'm A Celebrity, according to her friend and former campmate Brian Friendman.</p>
      <p>But Brian says reality veteran Jenner, who appeared in the US version in 2003, will be mentally tested like never before in her life.</p>
      <p>Asked if the 70-year-old - father of ten has a chance at winning, Friedman said: "Of course she does. Americans don’t always do that well. Ashley did great on the show, but Americans don’t always do that well. I mean I did it. But I think Caitlyn’s got a chance. Caitlyn is our version of the royal family here, so I think she has a shot. People love her.”</p>
      <p>But Friedman feels that the challenges of being in I'm A Celebrity are far tougher when the series was in its early years - last time she competed.</p>

      <p>Friedman added: '“Caitlyn has already been through a lot on her journey, so I think that she’s tough and she’ll be able to handle what is thrown at her socially. I think what happens to you physically and mentally is something you can’t be ready for. You can’t prepare for it.</p>
      <p>“I spoke to some friends of mine who had been on the show prior to going in the jungle and asked them what to be ready for and they couldn’t really give any advice.</p>
      <p>“They said you just have to go in and figure it out yourself. I figured it out. It was definitely the hardest thing I’ve ever gone through. Day two is where you realize, ‘I’m good. I can go home now.’ But then the competitor in you wants to fight it out and stay there, but it’s definitely a challenge and I give it up to Caitlyn for accepting that challenge, but she’s in for a ride.”</p>
      <p>Caitlyn biggest issue may be missing her luxury life.</p>

      <p>Speaking at the 9th Annual World Choreography Awards, Brian added: “The Olympics are nothing like having to stick your hands into snakes, and monitor lizards, and scorpions, and all of these different things that you encounter. And swimming in pig faeces and pig semen. It’s the most vile thing I’ve ever done in my life, but you come out of it feeling like a warrior.”</p>
      <p>“No, you don’t think about the cameras. The cameras disappear after the first 20 minutes. It’s the bugs, it’s the heat, it’s the exhaustion, it’s the hunger, it’s just being uncomfortable at all times of the day and then being separated from your family, being separated from every ounce of luxury that you knew. You are not pampered out there, you are not taken care of in the least.</p>
      <p>“Safety, yeah, there are safety precautions that have been taken, but I called it celebrity torture camp. That was my name for it while I was out there. It is the worst and best experience I’ve ever done in my life.”</p>
