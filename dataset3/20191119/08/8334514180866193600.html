      <p>BEIRUT (Reuters) - Queues built as Lebanese banks reopened on Tuesday after a one-week closure, with police deployed at branches and banks imposing tight restrictions on hard currency withdrawals and transfers abroad.</p>
      <p>Banks have mostly been closed since protests erupted against Lebanon’s ruling elite on Oct. 17. They reopened after a two-week closure on Nov. 1, but shut again a week later because of a strike by staff who complained of intimidation from clients demanding their cash.</p>
      <p>Seeking to avoid capital flight, the Association of Banks in Lebanon announced on Sunday that cash withdrawals would be limited to $1,000 a week and transfers abroad would be restricted to urgent personal spending only.</p>
      <p>The central bank has said deposits are safe and that it has the capacity to maintain the value of the Lebanese pound, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar.</p>
      <p>In Beirut’s Hamra area, around 50 people were waiting at a branch of Blom Bank shortly after it opened, a witness said.</p>
      <p>In the Sodeco area of the capital, about 20 people each were waiting at another branch of Blom Bank and at a branch of Bank Audi, a witness said.</p>
      <p>“Everyone has a lack of trust, there’s a state of panic, and people’s feelings are justifiable because no one is giving them any trust,” said a customer at the bank, who declined to give his name.</p>
      <p>In the southern city of Sidon, around 50 people were waiting at a branch of Blom Bank ahead of opening, a witness said.</p>
