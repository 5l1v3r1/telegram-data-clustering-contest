        <b>THE beast who launched a vicious machete attack on a teenage girl holding a baby sliced so deep that her lung was cut open.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Geraldine Maughan, 13, was struck on the legs and back when three men burst into her family home in Lisnaskea, Co Fermanagh on Saturday night.</p>

        <figcaption>The horror incident took place on Saturday night</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>She threw herself on top of her 11-month-old nephew as a “laughing” middle aged man belted her with the blade. Another man, believed to be one of his sons, hacked at her legs with the machete while recording the obscene attack on a mobile phone.</p>
      <p>Slightly-built Geraldine, who had been cuddling godson John Joyce, is being treated for a range of wounds, including the deep, six inch gash.</p>
      <p>Her sister Pauline, 20, the child’s mother, told how air was leaking from her back as she tried to breathe after the savage assault.</p>

      <p>She said: “Her lung collapsed right away. The way she has been cut means she can’t walk now and has to learn to walk again.</p>
      <p>“She’ll be in hospital for weeks. Her back won’t be the same for about 12 months.</p>
      <p>“She’s very frightened from what happened. She was just sitting there and they just walked in and two of them started hitting at her.</p>
      <p>“It’s disgraceful, grown men doing that to a girl and baby.”</p>
      <p>Police are treating the bloody assault as attempted murder.</p>
      <p>Lizzy Joyce, the boy’s grandmother, appealed for “no retaliation”, saying she was looking forward to “smiling when they go to jail”.</p>

        <figcaption>The 41-year-old was also wounded in the vicious onslaught</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>She said her sons had left the house in Trasna Way just minutes before the machete mob arrived at around 9.15pm.</p>
      <p>The 41-year-old was also wounded in the vicious onslaught, but managed to strike one attacker in the face with a picture frame.</p>
      <p>She said: “I think they waited and saw my lads going out of the estate and then they came.</p>

      <p>“They thought my husband would be here and came for him but he wasn’t here either.”</p>
      <p>The mum-of-six, who has four sons, went on: “They came through the door and two of them were attacking at a 13-year-old girl, my daughter-in-law’s sister.</p>
      <p>“All of them had the machetes. I’ll never forget because that man, a grown man, was laughing as he hit that girl.</p>
      <p>"One of them came at me and I stood up because I knew they would be slicing me up.</p>
      <p>“I got up to stop him getting any proper hits at me. I started fighting back because the instinct for survival got in my head.</p>
      <p>"When I started fighting back I grabbed for a picture frame and hit him hard in the face.”</p>
      <p>She added: “He pulled his mask up then, a balaclava, and I could see who he was. He was backing away to the door.</p>
      <p>“The other two had black hats but I could see their faces.”</p>

        <figcaption>Lizzy shows some of her injuries</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>She said the men “ran out” to where they had left their blue car at the top of a hill.</p>
      <p>Lizzy gave chase but the men, who had taped over their car’s registration number, sped off.</p>
      <p>She said of Geraldine: “She’s a legend, she’s a hero, a fighter.</p>
      <p>“When I came back to the house I grabbed the little fella first and checked him over and he was fine.</p>
      <p>“Then I checked Geraldine and she was destroyed. You could see the blood spitting out of the back of the girl where her lung was split.</p>
      <p>“I got on the phone to the boys and said ‘we’re cut up’ and called an ambulance.”</p>
      <p>Her husband Gramsey Joyce, a bare knuckle boxer with a fearsome reputation in the Travelling community, was a distance away in the estate — but told how he “heard the screams.”</p>
      <p>Mr Joyce, who is recovering from a cancer operation, ran to the house.</p>
      <p>He said: “They were already gone when I got here. I came in and I was just thinking it was the smell of death.</p>
      <p>“It made me think of a car crash we were in and there had been blood and it was like that, blood everywhere and I could smell death.</p>
      <p>“But thankfully no one was killed.”</p>
      <p>He said he believed that the attackers “came to kill me”.</p>
      <p>Lizzy said: “The PSNI are working with the Gardai and they have promised me faithfully these men will be caught.</p>
      <p>“They would be better off to just hand themselves in instead of hiding because it’s only going to be a matter of weeks before the police come and get them.”</p>
      <p>She added: “We want no retaliation. We want justice, the best retaliation will be in the court when I’m smiling as they go to jail.</p>
      <p>“And I have my boys told that. That will be the best retaliation.”</p>
      <p>She said that brave Geraldine is “only a little skinny one, about seven stone weight six, six”, and continued: “If men like that do that to her, they’d do that to anyone.</p>
      <p>“I’m not bothered about the wounds I have but that’s a girl in the hospital who is sitting up and trying to sleep because they can’t even lie her down on her back.</p>
      <p>"It’ll be a long recovery for a little girl.”</p>
      <p>It’s understood that the men suspected of involvement in the attack have told pals they have an alibi from the night.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, police are in possession of the video recording made by the attackers as they made their way to the house and began their brutal assault.</p>
      <p>Det Sgt Keith Monaghan said the incident was a terrifying ordeal for those involved.</p>
      <p>He said: “We are determined to find the men responsible.”</p>
      <p>He added detectives were investigating several lines of inquiry.</p>
