      <p>James Van Der Beek has revealed his wife Kimberly has suffered a miscarriage with the couple’s sixth child.</p>
      <p>The former Dawson’s Creek star, 42, revealed the tragic news during his appearance on Dancing With The Stars this week after he had originally planned to miss the semi-final.</p>
      <p>He said on his VT: ‘My wife Kimberly and I went through every expecting parent’s worst nightmare. We lost the baby.</p>
      <p>‘The little soul that we had expected to welcome into our family took a shortcut to whatever lies beyond.</p>
      <p>‘You never know why these things happen, that’s what I’ve been telling my kids. All you know is that it brings you closer together, it breaks you open, it opens up your heart, it deepens your appreciation. It makes you more human.’</p>
      <p>James hadn’t planned to dance on the show, but says his wife convinced him to go ahead with the performance.</p>

      <p>He told the rest of his followers about what happened, posting on Instagram: ‘Wrecked. Devastated. In shock. That’s how we’re feeling right now after the soul we thought were going to welcome into our family in April… has taken a short cut to whatever lies beyond this life.</p>

      <p>‘We’ve been through this before, but never this late in the pregnancy, and never accompanied by such a scary, horrific threat to @vanderkimberly and her well-being.</p>
      <p>‘Grateful that she’s now recovering, but we’ve only just begun unpacking the layers of this one. Thank you to all of our friends and co-workers (and dance partners) who have shown up for us so beautifully during this time.</p>

      <p>‘As many of you have said, “There are no words…” and it’s true. Which is why in a time like this it’s enough to know that you’re there. Grieving AND counting our blessings today.’</p>
      <p>James and Kimberly married in 2010 and share Olivia, nine, seven-year old Joshua, Annabel Leah, five, three-year-old Emilia and 16-month-old Gwendolyn.</p>
      <p>They had announced they were expecting their sixth child in October, which was due to be born in April.</p>
