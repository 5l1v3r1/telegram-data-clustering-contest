      <h1>Wayne Rooney, Jimmy Carr and other stars win £263m HMRC battle over North Tyneside developments</h1>
      <h2>As a result of the ruling, some of the investors will be able to claim money back</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T08:24:54+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 08:24</time> by <a rel="author">Kieran Murray, Jeremy Armstrong</a></address>
      <p>Wayne Rooney is among a host of stars who have beaten HMRC in a fight over a £263million investment scheme which built developments in Tyneside.</p>
      <p>The taxman argued the England legend and hundreds of celebrities had benefited excessively from tax relief for the project to build two data centres at Cobalt Business Park in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/north-tyneside">North Tyneside</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/wayne-rooney-jimmy-carr-stars-20910288">the Mirror reports.</a></p>
      <p>The centres are now trading under the name Stellium Datacenters.</p>
      <p>But the High Court ruled against HMRC so some of the investors who have already paid tax demands will be able to claim money back.</p>

      <p>Rooney is among 675 investors, including comedian Jimmy Carr, Arsene Wenger, Roy Hodgson, the late Status Quo guitarist Rick Parfitt, and Lady Elizabeth-Ann Redgrave, wife of Olympic legend Sir Steve.</p>
      <p>In 2011 they put in £79m – an average of £117,000 each – towards the £263m Cobalt Data Centres 2 and 3 in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/north-tyneside">North Tyneside</a> , which were unused for years.</p>
      <p>But they got back £131m in tax relief via the scheme to start economic growth in deprived areas.</p>
      <p>It is not clear how much each celebrity put in.</p>
      <p>There was no suggestion of wrongdoing by any of the investors.</p>
      <p>An HMRC spokesman said: “We are disappointed with the decision and are considering an appeal.”</p>
      <p>Carr’s tax affairs were scrutinised after he was named among investors in a tax avoidance scheme.</p>
      <p>In 2012, he admitted making a “terrible error of judgement”.</p>
      <p>In 2016, according to Companies House, he resigned from the Cobalt investment.</p>

      <p>That year, some investors received accelerated payment notices, which meant they had to pay HMRC first. Some then appealed to a tax tribunal.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Hodgson and Wenger said then they were “pleased to invest in ­Government-backed programmes which will hopefully help to generate new jobs.”</p>
      <p>Lady Redgrave also said she had done so “in good faith on advice of my financial adviser through an investment scheme”.</p>
      <p>Last year Rooney’s spokesman said he always paid “all UK taxes in full and in accordance with the law of the time”.</p>
      <p>On Monday he declined to comment on the ruling but scheme backer Harcourt Capital LLP was said to be “very pleased.”</p>
      <p>A spokesman said it showed, based on the law and custom and practice, that the HMRC had been wrong to deny enterprise zone ­allowances to their investors.</p>
