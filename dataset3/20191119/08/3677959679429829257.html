      <p><a href="https://amzn.to/2KzbAAl">Need for Speed Heat</a> launched earlier this month on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, about two years after the previous installment in the arcade racing series, the much-dreaded Need for Speed Payback.</p>
      <p>As it turns out, this time the developers at Ghost Games are enjoying a more positive reception from the community of fans. Earlier today, they <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/GhostGamesEA/status/1196443336539824129">revealed</a> Need for Speed Heat to have just set a franchise record for most launch week players in this console generation.</p>

      <p>Nathan <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/need-for-speed-heat/">just posted our review</a> and it's not exactly a ringing endorsement, though, as you can easily glean from the final summary quoted below.</p>
      <blockquote>Need for Speed Heat ditching its predecessor’s heavy-handed microtransactions and live-service nonsense is commendable, but in most other ways, this is actually a step back for the series. The game provides some solid arcade thrills, but a limited map, so-so visuals, slapdash action, and irritating cops weigh the experience down. If you’re desperate for a new open-world racer, Need for Speed Heat may be worth a spin, but most will want to wait until this one hits the used car lot.</blockquote>
