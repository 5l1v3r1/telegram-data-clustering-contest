      <p>Cape Town - Despite sporting revenues of £135.4 million for the first quarter of 2019/20, <b>Manchester United</b> have seen their net debt increase by 55.5%.</p>
      <p>The figures represent a £400 000 increase on the same period for the previous year.</p>
      <p>Commercial revenue was £80.4 million, a 5.9% increase on the previous year, the club said in a financial statement.</p>
      <p>United are expecting 2020 annual revenue to be down this year to somewhere between £560-580 million, compared to £627.1 million for the year ending June 30, 2019.</p>
      <p>In part that will be due to the club's lack of Champions League football this season.</p>
      <p>Broadcasting revenue for the quarter was £32.9 million, a 23.1% and £9.9 million drop on the same quarter the year before.</p>
      <p>The figures published on Monday cover the period July 1, 2019, to September 30 of this year.</p>
      <p>One of the most eye-catching points on the balance sheet is the increase of net debt, from £247.2 million to £384.5 million, a rise of 55.5% or £137.3 million.</p>
      <p>The club's wage bill has dropped by 8.8% "primarily due to reductions in player salaries as a result of non-participation in the UEFA Champions League", the statement said.</p>
      <p>United's executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward said: "We have a clear vision in terms of football philosophy and recruitment.</p>
      <p>"The significant investments that we have made in recent years in areas such as transfers, recruitment infrastructure, analytics and our academy are already beginning to bear fruit.</p>
      <p>"We are very proud to be shortly approaching a milestone 4 000th game featuring an academy player, and we are particularly optimistic regarding the considerable young talent currently coming through.</p>
      <p>"Our ultimate goal is to win trophies by playing exciting football with a team that fuses graduates from our academy with world-class acquisitions."</p>
      <p>United's on-field fortunes have improved in recent weeks after pressure had been growing on manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.</p>
      <p>The team have won five of their last six matches in all competitions, and prior to that claimed a 1-1 draw at league leaders Liverpool.</p>
      <p>They are seventh in the Premier League, nine points adrift of the Champions League qualification places.</p>
