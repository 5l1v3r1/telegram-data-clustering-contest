      <h2>Furious residents condemned "daft" plans to build six shops, now the developer is having its say</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T08:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Herbert Soden</a></address>
      <p>A developer has defended controversial plans to build shops near a roundabout.</p>
      <p>As previously reported furious residents condemned "daft" plans to build six shops next to a <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/shiremoor">Shiremoor </a>roundabout raising pollution and traffic fears.</p>
      <p>Northumberland Estates have submitted a scheme to the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/north-tyneside-council">council</a> that would see the stores built on land next to the Holystone roundabout.</p>
      <p>But locals are not happy and have submitted 25 objections to the council's planning portal, sharing fears about HGVs, traffic, polution, the safety of local kids, and congregating louts.</p>
      <p>But, Northumberland Estates has defended the plans saying that the small rank of shops would become a "valuable community asset".</p>
      <p>Anthony Cape, asset manager at Northumberland Estates, said: “The scheme has been designed as a small neighbourhood amenity to serve local residents"</p>
      <p>A lot of the objectors were concerned about traffic with one writing: "The roads surrounding the estate are already congested and the proposed development will only add to this."</p>
      <p>But Mr Cape claims that the shops are in walking distance and would encourage people out of their cars.</p>
      <p>He continued: "This is something which is currently missing in the area and we hope this would encourage people to walk to the shops rather than drive to the local supermarket on the Eastern side of the Holystone roundabout.</p>
      <p>"The shops would provide convenience, particularly for parents walking to collect children from the local primary school and locals wanting items such as a newspaper or pint of milk. "</p>
      <p>Another objector raised fears about the safety of children, they said: "There is already a large volume of traffic with LGV, Taxis, Coaches, Service vehicles for a busy hotel and restaurant. The hotel already has plans to extend the hotel so this will also add to the traffic.</p>
      <p>"There is only going to be one exit route for the development this is down Edmund Road this is not acceptable as this is a private estate with already a large volume of traffic from a busy hotel and restaurant and will be very dangerous for the residents and children playing."</p>
      <p>One didn't mince their words saying that it was "a daft idea", and raising fears about noise.</p>
      <p>"The proposed plan has obviously not been thought through.</p>
      <p>"It is such a daft idea to have retails units that close to residential areas.</p>
      <p>"It will increase the level of noise and pollution going through Edmund road into the estate.</p>
      <p>"It will be unsafe for residents to have the increased level of traffic coming in."</p>
      <p>Mr Cape said that lorries wouldn't be visiting the shops often.</p>
      <p>He added: "The main basis for objection appears to centre on traffic concerns.</p>
      <p>"The scheme is limited on parking and we do not expect it to have an adverse impact; that said, we have instructed an independent traffic consultant to ensure we minimise the effect on traffic flows."</p>
      <p>"The proposed retail units are relatively small in size, therefore large delivery lorries should be a rare event. All in all this small retail parade designed to be a valuable community asset.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/north-tyneside-council">North Tyneside Council's</a> planning committee will decide on the application by mid November.</p>
