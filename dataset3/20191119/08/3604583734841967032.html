      <p>The timeline has been set for George Pell's High Court appeal with dates set for written submissions by Pell's lawyers to be submitted by early in the new year.</p>
      <p>Indicative dates published on the High Court's website shows that the applicant (Pell) has until January 8 to file a submission.</p>
      <p>The Victorian Director of Public Prosecutions, Kerri Judd QC, then has three days short of a month to respond with the respondent's submission due on February 5.</p>
      <p>A reply is then scheduled for February 26 leaving March as the earlier court date available.</p>
      <p>The High Court has indicated it will hear an appeal against his five sexual abuse convictions, referring his application for special leave to a full bench of the court.</p>
      <p>Pell is serving a maximum six-year jail term for the abuse of two choirboys in the 1990s.</p>
