      <p>TV actors Akanksha Puri is on cloud 9 as her Tamil film, Action is in theatres. The film, directed by Sundar C and also starring Vishal and Tammannah Bhatia, released last Friday (Nov 15). The actress has been getting good reviews for her work in the film and is elated about the same.  </p>
      <p>We got in touch with Akanksha to know how she is celebrating the moment of success and the actress bowled us over with her oh-so-sweet reply, which has a mention of her boyfriend, Paras Chhabra, who is currently locked inside the Bigg Boss 13 house.</p>

      <p>“Not without Paras. I will wait for him to come out and hopefully with a trophy in his hand, so that we have two reasons to celebrate,” Akanksha replied and we could sense from her voice that the actress was indeed blushing.</p>
      <p>Well, while the lady is waiting for her lover to come out, Paras is making a lot of noise inside the house. Just yesterday, we told you how he spoke shabbily about his ex-girlfriend Pavitra Punia, inside the BB house in a gathering, by saying that she hid his name’s tattoo by converting the design into a flower after they broke up. But SpotboyE.com found out that the tattoo was connected to Pavitra’s ex-fiancé, Sumit and not Paras and that Pavitra is extremely upset about him telling people lie inside the house.</p>
