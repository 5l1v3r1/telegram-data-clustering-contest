      <p>Ayushmann Khurrana, Bhumi Pednekar and Yami Gautam starrer Bala not only impressed the critics but also managed to entertain the audience with their content, hence, bringing in moolah at the box-office. On its opening day, Bala earned Rs. 10.15 crore and since then the film has been growing slowly and steadily due to good word of mouth. Just a few days ago,<a href="https://www.spotboye.com/bollywood/box-office-collections/bala-box-office-collection-day-7-ayushmann-khurrana-starrer-crosses-100-crore-mark-actor-says-people-equate-my-kind-of-cinema-to-good-cinema/5dce558a87fb571eff7e3e69"> Bala crossed the 100 crore mark at International markets</a>, for the same, the makers even shared a tweet on this happy occasion, tweeting, “Aapke dher saare pyaar ka nateeja hai yeh. Tahe dil se shukriya..”</p>
      <p>After crossing the 100 crore mark worldwide, the film is now aiming to score a 100 at the domestic markets as well. So far, on its second week, the film has collected Rs. 3.76 cr on Friday, Rs. 6.73 cr on Saturday, Rs. 8.01 cr on Sunday and Rs. 2.25 cr on Monday, making the grand total to Rs. 92.99 crores at the domestic markets. The film is just a few crores behind to achieve the 100 crore mark feat which will be achieved in the next 2-3 days. With Bala, Ayushmann has delivered 7 hits back-to-back, namely, Dream Girl, Article 15, Badhaai Ho, Andhadhun, Shubh Mangal Saavdhan and Bareilly Ki Barfi</p>
