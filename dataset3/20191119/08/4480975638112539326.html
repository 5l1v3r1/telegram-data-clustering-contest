      <h3>Gold Technical Analysis: 100-day SMA, 11-week-old trendline, cap immediate recovery</h3>
      <p>Prices are likely to revisit the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of April-September upside movement, at $1,445. However, a downward sloping trend-line since August 13, at $1,429, followed by a 50% <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance/fibonacci">Fibonacci</a> retracement level of $1,410 limits the bullion’s further declines. <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/news/gold-technical-analysis-100-day-sma-11-week-old-trendline-cap-immediate-rise-201911190530">Read more…</a></p>

      <h3>Gold consolidates the New York rally in $1,470s, bulls look to a 61.8% Fibo target</h3>
      <p>Spot <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/markets/commodities/metals/gold">gold</a> is currently trading between a range of $1471.56 and $1475.43, buoyed by a slightly risk-off session overnight following Sino/US trade deal headlines and pessimism as well as a weakening in the greenback and US yields. <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/news/gold-consolidates-the-new-york-session-bid-in-1-470s-bulls-look-to-a-618-fibo-target-201911190150">Read more...</a></p>

      <h3>Gold: Supported by the risk tone</h3>
      <p>The mind boggles, but I would say $1,557 (high for this year) will be challenged. Let’s not make assumptions or get too far down the road before we check the rearview mirror because the <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/events/brexit">Brexit</a> &amp; HK issues are still clouding things at the same time as we seem so far yet so near a trade deal (finally) being inked between the US &amp; China. <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/analysis/gold-supported-by-the-risk-tone-201911190211">Read more...</a></p>
