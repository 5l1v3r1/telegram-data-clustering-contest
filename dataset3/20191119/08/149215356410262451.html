      <h1>California says it won't buy vehicles from automakers siding with Trump against state emission standards</h1>

      <p>The California Department of General Services <a href="https://www.dgs.ca.gov/Press-Releases/Page-Content/News-List-Folder/State-Announces-New-Purchasing-Policies-to-Reduce-Greenhouse-Gas-Emissions">announced late Friday</a> that the state will only purchase hybrids and electric cars and trucks, with an exception for some public safety vehicles. In the statement, the department also said California will only buy state vehicles from companies that "recognize the California Air Resources Board (CARB)'s authority to set greenhouse gas and zero emission vehicle standards."</p>
      <p>Essentially, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/18/climate/california-automakers-trump.html"><i>The New York Times</i> reported Monday</a>, California announced it won't buy state vehicles from GM, Fiat Chrysler, Toyota, and some smaller automakers that <a href="https://theweek.com/speedreads/874940/toyota-gm-chrysler-back-trump-legal-fight-over-california-emissions-regulations">sided with the Trump administration</a> last month in its fight to strip California of its right to set its own tailpipe emission standards. Ford, Honda, Volkswagen, and BMW of North America reached agreement with California over the summer to make more fuel-efficient vehicles through 2025.</p>
      <p>"Carmakers that have chosen to be on the wrong side of history will be on the losing end of California's buying power," <a href="https://www.axios.com/california-ban-on-automakers-who-backed-trump-86d2cbd7-8824-401e-9ad1-81d5b5f45ff6.html">Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) said in a statement</a>. GM told the <i>Times</i> that California is undermining its own "goal of minimizing the state government's carbon footprint" by refusing to buy "vehicles like the Chevy Bolt." California seems to think it has enough other hybrid and electric vehicles to choose from.</p>
