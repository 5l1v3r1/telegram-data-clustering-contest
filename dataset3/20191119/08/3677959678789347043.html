      <p>Fortnite patch 11.20 will add support for DX12 to increase the game’s performance on high-end GPUs, Epic Games has announced.</p>
      <p>Epic announced the news on its official Fortnite blog. At the moment of writing, it hasn’t been confirmed when Fortnite patch 11.20 will be released but as AMD has already released its new Adrenalin 19.11.3 driver with support for the DX12 API in Fortnite, we’re pretty sure that Epic Games intends to release this update shortly.</p>

      <p>“By using DX12, PC players with high-end GPUs may experience a higher and steadier frame rate”, Epic Games <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/microsoft-directx-12-coming-to-fortnite">writes</a>. “This is because DX12 delivers better CPU performance and allows for the distribution of rendering jobs across multiple cores.”</p>
      <p>“In the future, we plan on adding features to Fortnite that are made possible by DX12. Allowing players to opt into DX12 before these features are added will give us valuable information in our development efforts and help us shake out any bugs.”</p>
      <p>As said, AMD has already released its new Radeon Software Adrenalin 2019 Edition 19.11.3 driver which adds Fortnite DX12 support. We’ve included the release notes for the new AMD Adrenalin 19.11.3 driver down below:</p>
