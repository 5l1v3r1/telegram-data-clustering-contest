      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T08:43:28+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 08:43</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/sampada-sharma/" target="_blank">Sampada Sharma</a></address>
      <p>The trailer of Tanhaji, starring Ajay Devgn in the titular role, is out. The film is set in 1670 when the Marathas fought against the Mughals to get back the fort at Kondana. Here, Ajay plays the titular character who has to fight against <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/saif-ali-khan/">Saif Ali Khan</a>’s Udaybhan as he protects the Mughal control over the fort.</p>
      <p>This movie season looks like it belongs to the Marathas. After the recently released trailer of Ashutosh Gowariker’s Panipat, Tanhaji too looks like it will celebrate Maratha courage. What’s extremely jarring here is the CGI that takes away from the experience of watching the three-and-a-half-minute trailer.</p>

      <p>The film is based on a historic event when Chhatrapati Shivaji’s mother vowed to stay barefoot until the Marathas took control of their fort at Kondana. Luke Kenny plays Aurangzeb, the ruler of the Mughal empire who appoints Saif Ali Khan’s character to do his dirty work. Saif’s character is painted as evil here. Sharad Kelkar plays the role of Chhatrapati Shivaji. <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/kajol/">Kajol</a> appears as Tanhaji’s wife Savitribai Malusare.</p>
      <p>Ajay Devgn and Saif Ali Khan were last seen together in Vishal Bhardwaj’s film Omkara. Much like Omkara, here too, they stand on opposite sides.</p>
      <p>In the past, Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s Bajirao Mastani left a strong impression on the audience with its depiction of Maratha glory. It is yet to be seen if those standards can be revised with Tanhaji.</p>
      <p>Directed by Om Raut, Tanhaji releases on January 10.</p>
