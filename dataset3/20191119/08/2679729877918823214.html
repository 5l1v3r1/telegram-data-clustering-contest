        <b>The African Development Bank (AfDB) has signed an unfunded $250-million Risk Participation Agreement (RPA) facility with ABSA bank.</b>
      </p>
      <p>In a statement, AfDB explains that the 3-year RPA facility was signed on November 12, on the sidelines of the Africa Investment Form through its trade finance operations. Under this 3-year RPA facility, the Bank and ABSA will share default risk on a portfolio of eligible trade transactions originated by African Issuing Banks (IBs) and confirmed by ABSA.</p>

      <p>Leveraging the Bank’s  AAA rating, ABSA will underwrite trade transactions issued by African issuing banks across key sectors like agriculture, energy, and light-manufacturing with a special focus on small and medium-sized enterprises (SME’s)  in fragile and low-income African countries.</p>
      <p>The Bank’s commitment under the RPA is to assume up to 50% (and 75% in special cases) of every underlying transaction issued by the IBs, while ABSA will confirm such a transaction and bear not less than 50% of its underlying risk.</p>
      <p>Working with strategic partners like ABSA, the Bank’s trade finance operations aim to facilitate inter and intra-Africa trade by reducing the trade financing gap on the continent. Since 2013, the Bank’s RPA programme has supported over 16 issuing banks with about $650 million limits in Southern Africa alone, with special focus on SMEs and local corporates in manufacturing, agribusiness, import/export and energy sectors.</p>

      <p>In the same period, the programme supported over $4 billion in trade volumes across Africa, with $938 million of that being intra-Africa trade. Other trade finance instruments employed by the Bank include: (i) <a href="https://www.afdb.org/en/topics-and-sectors/initiatives-partnerships/trade-finance-program/">Trade Finance Line of Credit (TFLoC)</a> – funded line provided to banks for the financing of exclusively trade-related transactions in Africa; and (ii) <a href="https://www.afdb.org/en/topics-and-sectors/initiatives-partnerships/trade-finance-program/">Soft Commodity Finance Facility (SCFF)</a> – funded instrument meant to support the financing of exports of soft commodities across the continent.</p>
      <p>“The RPA facility is one of the tools employed by the African Development Bank to alleviate poverty and achieve robust economic growth and sustainable development on the continent through: increased trade facilitation of import-export activities of African local corporates and SMEs; enhanced inter and intra-Africa trade; and regional integration,” said Pierre Guislain, Bank Vice President for Infrastructure, Private Sector and Industrialisation.</p>
      <p>“This is consistent with the Bank’s High 5s focus to Industrialise Africa, Light up Africa, Integrate Africa, Feed Africa and improve the living standards of Africans,” he added.</p>
