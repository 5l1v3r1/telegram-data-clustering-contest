      <h1>John McDonnell: ‘No one needs to be a billionaire’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T08:03:09+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 08:03</time> by <a rel="author">Anna Menin</a></address>
      <p>Shadow chancellor John McDonnell is set to take aim at billionaires today, describing their wealth as “obscene” as Labour releases research showing almost a third of Britain’s billionaires have donated money to the Tories.</p>
      <p>McDonnell is expected to say he wants to “rewrite the rules of our economy” in a speech in central London later today, presenting the election as a chance for voters to change a system where billionaires can buy access to power.</p>

      <p>Labour said that almost a third of the UK’s 151 billionaires have donated over £50m to the Conservatives since 2005, while the government is set to hand out £100bn of tax breaks for wealthy individuals and corporations by 2023/24.</p>
      <p>“Someone on the national minimum wage would have to work 69,000 years to get paid £1bn and a newly qualified nurse would have to wait 50,000 years,” McDonnell will say.</p>
      <p>“No one needs or deserves to have that much money, it is obscene.”</p>
      <p>“It is also obscene that these billionaires are buying access and tax breaks to Boris Johnson’s Conservative Party.”</p>
      <p>Labour is pledging to redistribute wealth “to the many, not the few” if it wins the upcoming general election on 12 December.</p>
      <p>Its economic policies include the nationalisation of rail, utility and water companies, moving towards a four-day working week, and higher taxes for the wealthy.</p>
      <p>Labour’s plan to nationalise parts of BT to provide free full-fibre broadband to every UK household, announced last week, have been condemned by broadband providers as showing a “fundamental misunderstanding” of how the industry works.</p>

      <p>The Conservatives have hit back at Labour’s tax plans, saying they would hurt hard-pressed families instead of billionaires.</p>
      <p>“Labour will massively ramp up spending and would hammer ordinary people with an extra £2,400 [in] taxes every year,” said Treasury minister Simon Clarke.</p>
