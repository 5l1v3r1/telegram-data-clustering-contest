      <p>Per Mertesacker has issued praise to former Arsenal team-mate Mikel Arteta and has revealed he would love to work with the Spaniard again in the future.</p>
      <p>The former <a href="https://www.football.london/arsenal-fc/">Gunners </a>defender, who now runs the club's academy, played alongside Arteta for five years at the Emirates Stadium after they both arrived in the summer of 2011.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/mikel-arteta">Arteta </a>then retired in 2016 and left to join Manchester City, working as Pep Guardiola's assistant and playing a key role in the club's back-to-back Premier League triumphs.</p>
      <p>He was also touted as a candidate to succeed Arsene Wenger in North London in 2018 and, with pressure upon Unai Emery rising, has been mentioned as a candidate to be the next manager at the Emirates Stadium.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.football.london/all-about/per-mertesacker">Mertesacker </a>has now thrown his weight behind Arteta, praising his former colleague colleague and admitting he would love to work alongside him in the future.</p>
      <p>"I was his vice-captain at Arsenal and he trusted me. I was by his side during team meetings and we had a great bond. I’d love to work with him again, a top guy," he told FourFourTwo.</p>

      <p>Mertesacker also praised former Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger, who was appointed last week as the new Head of Football Development at Fifa.</p>
      <p>"He has an aura – it’s difficult to explain. He demands a lot, but makes you feel comfortable, too. It’s about trust. In hard times, he was a rock protecting us. I’ll always be very grateful to him."</p>
