      <p>A lot of people think current politics stink but this Democratic Congressman has denied it’s his fault.</p>
      <p>Eric Swalwell rejected a claim he had farted live on TV after viewers heard a loud noise during his interview on MSNBC’s Hardball yesterday night.</p>
      <p>The Californian Rep was replying to host Chris Matthews when in mid-sentence it sounded like he had let one rip.</p>
      <p>But Mr Swalwell, who had been talking about US President Donald Trump’s impeachment hearings, later denied he had let off a buttock bassoon or fired a stink torpedo.</p>

      <p>In a <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/addybaird/eric-swalwell-denies-fart-msnbc-chris-matthews">text to Buzzfeed News</a> yesterday night, he wrote: ‘It was not me!!!!!</p>
      <p>‘Ha. And I didn’t hear it when I was speaking.’</p>

      <p>In the message, Mr Swalwell, who is a member of the House Intelligence Committee, did admit he had found the noise funny when he watched his interview back but claimed he hadn’t heard anything during the broadcast.</p>
      <p>MSNBC’s Hardball later attributed the noise to a ‘mug scraping across the desk’.</p>
      <p>Yeah, right.</p>
      <p>It definitely sounded like a mug scraping across the desk and not a huge acid-rain maker.</p>
      <p>Many people are not buying the explanation and a #fartgate hashtag is currently trending on Twitter.</p>
      <p>Give the video a watch and decide for yourselves.</p>
