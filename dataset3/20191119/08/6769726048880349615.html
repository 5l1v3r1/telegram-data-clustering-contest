      <p>PERTH’S Outback Splash celebrated the launch of its latest water slide attraction for thrill-seekers on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Paul Woodcock, who owns the Bullsbrook business with Phil Dixon, said it was an exciting day launching the tower with two tube slides, a thrill slide and Australia’s fastest body slide.</p>
      <p>“The <a href="https://www.communitynews.com.au/the-advocate/business/perths-outback-splash-take-thrillseekers-to-new-heights/">water slide tower</a> is the largest capital investment that our family has ever made,” he said.</p>
      <p>“In future we are hoping to put in a pool – there’s big demand from guests for that.”</p>

      <p>The 20m-high tower, designed and built by Polin Waterparks and Swimplex Aquatics, features four fibreglass waterslides totalling 489m for thrill seekers.</p>
      <p>Those include two raft slides called ‘The Wall’ and ‘Blackout’, an enclosed golden speed slide called ‘Gold Rush’ and WA’s fastest body slide, named ‘The Wedgie’, which sees riders plunge downward at speeds of up to 75km/h.</p>

      <p>Mr Woodcock and Mr Dixon went down ‘The Wall’ tube slide together, both agreeing on their favourites.</p>
      <p>“I’ve done it a few times and it’s still scary,” Mr Woodcock said.</p>
      <p>“The Wall would be my favourite followed by the Gold Rush.”</p>

      <p>Mr Dixon said the facility offered a greater variety of experiences for a bigger demographic of visitors, with the older water slides more suited to families with children under 12.</p>
      <p>For safety reasons, people have to be at least 1.2m tall to use the new slides.</p>
      <p>The maximum weight on the body slide is 120kg while on double rafts it is 180kg, with scales at the top of the tower to ensure visitors comply.</p>

      <p>The additional attractions have created about 10 extra jobs, with the venue employing about 70 to 80 people this summer.</p>
      <p>Tourism Council of WA chief executive Evan Hall and Tourism Minister Paul Papalia attended the <a href="https://www.communitynews.com.au/the-advocate/business/perths-outback-splash-in-countdown-to-open-waterslides/">ribbon-cutting ceremony on November 19</a>.</p>
      <p>Mr Hall praised the owners’ “passion, patience and persistence” to create a new attraction in Perth, which he said would be popular with families as well as visitors to the State.</p>

      <p>Mr Woodcock said they expected visitor numbers to increase when North Link opened, with large signs on the road to help people find the site.</p>
      <p>Guests included family, friends, Moore MHR Ian Goodenough, Swan Hills MLA Jessica Shaw, Swan Mayor Kevin Bailey and councillor Patty Jones, and Joondalup Mayor Albert Jacob.</p>
      <p>Mr Woodcock thanked everyone who had helped with the project and supported the business, including their families, employees and industry.</p>
