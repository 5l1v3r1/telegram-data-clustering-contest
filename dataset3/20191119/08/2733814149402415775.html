      <h1>Valve Announces Half-Life: Alyx, Its First Flagship VR Game</h1>

      <p>Yesterday, Valve <a href="https://twitter.com/valvesoftware/status/1196566870360387584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1196566870360387584&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fajax%2Finset%2Fiframe%3Fid%3Dtwitter-1196566870360387584%26autosize%3D1">announced</a> Half-Life: Alyx, the first new game in the acclaimed Half-Life series in well over a decade. And unlike the previous Half-Life installments, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/18/20971514/valve-announces-half-life-alyx-its-first-flagship-vr-game">this game will be playable exclusively in virtual reality</a>. The Verge reports: <i>We don't currently have any details beyond the tweet from Valve above, which appears to be the first tweet from a new, Twitter-verified Valve Software account established in June. But clearly, we'll be learning more on Thursday, presumably from this social media account, at 10am PT. Despite being some of the most influential and critically acclaimed PC games ever made, Valve has famously never finished either of its Half-Life supposed trilogies of games. After Half-Life and Half-Life 2, the company created Half-Life: Episode 1 and Half-Life: Episode 2, but no third game in the series. The closest we've come to knowing anything about where Half-Life was headed was <a href="https://games.slashdot.org/story/17/08/25/2220258/ex-valve-writer-reveals-what-might-have-been-half-life-2-episode-3s-story">this thinly veiled fanfic from former Valve writer Marc Laidlaw</a>.</i></p>
