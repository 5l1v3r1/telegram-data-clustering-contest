      <p>A FUNDRAISER in Tuart Hill aims to help WA babies enjoy the best possible start to life.</p>
      <p>Charity Little Things for Tiny Tots is holding a morning tea on December 3, which is also the international day of generosity known as Giving Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Local businesses will be providing sweet treats, beverages, a parent pamper station and children’s activities at Tuart Hill Community Centre from 9.30am to 11am.</p>
      <p>Funds raised will go towards the charity’s operational costs for 2020 so it can continue working towards its goal of ensuring every baby in WA has the support, care and essentials they need to grow and thrive.</p>
      <p>The volunteer-run organisation provides new and pre-loved essential baby items to Perth families in need, including people impacted by domestic violence, homelessness, mental illness, drug or alcohol addiction and bereavement.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.eventbrite.com.au/e/little-things-for-tiny-tots-givingtuesday-morning-tea-tickets-77702776095">Tickets to the fundraiser</a> cost $15 for one adult and one child.</p>
