      <p>In the latest instance, investment firm Platinum Victory has once again failed to increase its stake, Vinamilk said Monday.</p>
      <p>The Singapore-based company has been unable to increase its stake from 10.62 percent to 11.62 percent as of November 15 "due to unfavorable market conditions," the Vinamilk statement said.</p>
      <p>Platinum Victory, a unit of Singapore’s leading diversified conglomerate Jardine Cycle &amp; Carriage, has immediately registered again to buy the 1 percent stake between November 21 and December 20, Vinamilk added.</p>
      <p>Since early last year, another Singapore-based company, F&amp;N Dairy Investments, which is the largest foreign investor in Vinamilk at 17.31 percent, has also been unsuccessful in repeated attempts to raise its stake by one percent.</p>
      <p>Vinamilk is among the largest listed companies in the country with a market cap of VND208.96 trillion ($9 billion). From January to September, the company’s after-tax profit rose 5.8 percent year-on-year to VND7.92 trillion ($341.5 million). The state is its largest stakeholder at 36 percent.</p>
      <p>Platinum Victory had last month proposed to spend $60 million on <a href="https://e.vnexpress.net/news/business/companies/singapore-firm-to-invest-60-mln-in-vietnam-appliance-maker-4004766.html">increasing its stake</a> in Vietnam’s industrial appliance maker REE from 24.9 percent to 35.01 percent.</p>
