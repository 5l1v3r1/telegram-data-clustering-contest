      <p>Dancehall artiste Shatta Wale who has been beefing his colleague in the industry Bhim Nations President Stonebwoy last Saturday at the 4Syte Tv Video Music Awards did the unthinkable by gifting his award to Stonebwoy.</p>
      <p>After this move, his former right-hand partner Pope Skinny sent out a warning to Stonebwoy to be careful with Shatta Wale because he has something hidden up his sleeves.</p>
      <p>Pope Skinny continued that, the act by Shatta Wale at the awards night was just a movie he(Shatta) was acting because he can’t be trusted.</p>
      <p>Well, Shatta Wale has responded to Pope Skinny by sharing a photo of himself and Stonebwoy hugging with the caption ‘Real Blood’ indicating that what Pope Skinny said was never coming to pass.</p>
      <p>See screenshot below:</p>

      <p>We wait to see how this newfound friendship between the two former enemies would go since not just Pope Skinny but a lot of other music lovers have hinted that their friendship wouldn’t last forever.</p>
