      <p>More than £1,000,000 worth of jewellery has been stolen from a mansion in Haringey, North London.</p>
      <p>Police were called to Hampstead Lane on November 14 after an unknown number of burglars broke into the property while a woman, in her 30s, and children were inside.</p>
      <p>The suspects are believed to have scaled the side of the building, before forcing their way inside at around 5pm.</p>
      <p>They then grabbed various items, including jewellery, designer clothing and a substantial sum of money, before escaping out of the first floor window.</p>
      <p>Detective Inspector Paul Ridley, who is leading the investigation, is now calling on anyone with information to come forward.</p>

      <p>He said: ‘Burglary is an extremely intrusive crime and the effect is often compounded further when the occupants are at home.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘This is an aggravating feature of this case as the victim was present with her young children when the burglars have forced entry, scaling the wall of the mansion and brazenly ransacking the premises.</p>
      <p>‘I am today releasing images of some of the items that were stolen and are of huge sentimental value to the victim.</p>
      <p>‘Many of of these are very distinctive and rare including the necklace, ring and earrings.</p>
      <p>‘I would ask anyone who has been offered this jewellery, including private collectors or jeweller’s; or seen these items for sale anywhere, to report it to us immediately.</p>
