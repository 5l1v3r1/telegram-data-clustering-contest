      <p>India vice-captain Ajinkya Rahane says he is already “dreaming” about the first-ever Day-Night Test in the country, which is starting from Friday against Bangladesh at Eden Gardens here.</p>
      <p>“Already dreaming about the historic pink ball test,” Rahane said in a Twitter post along with a picture of him sleeping and a pink ball lying next to him.</p>

      <p>The Mumbai batsman is scheduled to land in the city on Tuesday morning along with skipper Virat Kohli.</p>
      <p>India thrashed Bangladesh by an innings and 130 runs in the first Test and will look to whitewash it here as they start their pink ball Test campaign.</p>
      <p>The Kohli-led side are already top of the ICC World Test Championship chart with 300 points from six matches, recording wins in all six of them.</p>
      <h3>Dhawan, Kohli react</h3>
      <p>Dhawan replied: “Sapney mein pic khich gayi (picture was clicked in dream).”</p>
      <p>Skipper Kohli too joined in the fun and he lauded Rahane for his pose and said: “Nice pose jinksy.”</p>
