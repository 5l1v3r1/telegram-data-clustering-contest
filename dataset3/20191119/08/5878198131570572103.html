      <p>A delegation from Barbados to Ghana has handed over for burial, the remains of an unknown slave who died in the 19th century on the island during the period of the Transatlantic Slave Trade.</p>
      <p>The delegation, led by Barbados’ prime minister, Mia Motley, took the remains to the coastal town of Assin Manso, where they were received by the town’s traditional elders and people.</p>
      <p>Assin Manso, a town more than 300 years old, is home to what is known as the Ancestral River Site, a small river where historians say slaves were made to take final baths.</p>
      <p>This is where the remains of the Barbadian slave will be laid to final rest.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/NewsArchive/Remains-of-unknown-enslaved-African-to-be-buried-in-Assin-Manso-slave-river-site-799150">reports</a>, this will bring to three, the number of African slave remains buried at the site in Assin Manso in recent years.</p>
      <p>The Barbadian delegation also paid visits to some of Ghana’s most historic places including the mausoleum of the famous pan-African and first president, <a href="https://face2faceafrica.com/article/several-times-they-tried-most-of-the-time-they-escaped-these-african-leaders-survived-deadly-assassination-attempts">Kwame Nkrumah</a>.</p>
      <p>Motley and her team announced plans to open a diplomatic mission in Ghana, the first in Africa, before the end of the year.</p>
      <p>Of Barbados’ over 90% black population, the majority are thought to be descendants of slaves taken from the Gold Coast (presently Ghana) and the West African region.</p>
