      <p>I was crying in the bike storage area of Westfield Stratford on the phone to my Mum, when a woman almost bumped into me. She looked up, saw my tears and then, holding eye contact, backed away slowly as if they were catching.</p>
      <p>I was crying surrounded by locked up push bikes, so perhaps she thought I'd got a flat tire or that I just <i>really</i> cared about sustainable transport. Actually, I had just been told — aged 30 — that I needed a hearing aid and it was a bit of a shock.</p>
      <p>It all started at the <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/edinburgh-fringe">Edinburgh Fringe Festival</a> in 2016. Comedian Felicity Ward was DJing; she is a great DJ and I was so excited I was standing right next to the speaker. That was the first time I heard a strange noise coming from inside my ear. It was like a whirring noise or a tiny animal rustling around (yes, I thought I had a spider living in my ear because I have anxiety and we've all seen those scary YouTube videos: "woman pops a spot and ten spiders crawl out of the cavity"). Following months of anxiety I went to the Doctor and was told I had <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/tinnitus">tinnitus</a>.</p>
      <p>I was sent for a hearing test just as a precaution – so it was a complete shock when the audiologist told me I had hearing loss on one side and recommended I use a hearing aid for the rest of my life. To add insult to injury, I was sent for an MRI to ensure that my one-sided hearing loss was nothing more sinister.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, it wasn’t, but being told you need to wear a hearing aid at 30 is still a bit of a shock. I thought my life was changed forever and that my job as a comedian and actor — starring in series like <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/the-crown"><i>The Crown</i></a> and <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/call-the-midwife"><i>Call the Midwife</i></a> — would be over. How could I wear a modern hearing aid in period dramas? Who is going to book a comedian who can't hear and interact with the audience?</p>
      <p>If I’m honest, my own preconceptions about hearing loss played a part. I didn’t hear much about young women who had any sort of hearing loss and the havoc it wreaks on your self-confidence. In my eyes hearing aids were for people with grey hair who had Werther's Originals in their pockets: I thought that my days of feeling young were behind me.</p>
      <p>That’s why I wrote a children’s book about a little girl with a hearing aid. <i>Harriet Versus the Galaxy </i>sees the young protagonist bolstered by her disability. Harriet’s hearing aid doesn't hold her back: it translates alien languages and helps her save the world.</p>
      <p>My own hearing aid has been a bit of a personal superpower – it has actually been one of the best things that has ever happened to me. I still act and perform comedy but it has also helped push me to do more and opened up some amazing opportunities.</p>
      <p>Through my work with the <a href="https://www.tinnitus.org.uk/">British Tinnitus Association</a> and <a href="https://www.actiononhearingloss.org.uk/">Action on Hearing Loss</a> charities I have met such incredible people with similar experiences and there isn’t a grey hair or Werther’s Original in sight. I am now proud to be an Ambassador for both charities to continue raising awareness.</p>
      <p><i>Harriet Versus the Galaxy </i>was released this October and I have already received so many messages from children and parents who have read the book and feel less alone. Some even think hearing aids are cool.</p>

      <p>I think it’s so important that every child sees themselves represented in children’s books and there aren’t enough books with disabled heroes. I hope that my book can start conversations around hearing loss and disability and make people realise that sometimes the hardest times in our lives can bring the greatest rewards.</p>
