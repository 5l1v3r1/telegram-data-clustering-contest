      <p>Bristol City midfielder Adam Nagy is one game away from European Championship qualification with Hungary.</p>
      <p>His side will face Wales tonight and a win will see them finish second in the group and, ahead of the game, Nagy has been speaking about how he made his injury worse, playing against club teammate Ashley Williams and <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-fc">Bristol City's</a> aims for the season.</p>
      <p>Nagy has only managed three appearances in the Championship this season after picking up an ankle ligament injury earlier in the season.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/a-superb-display-player-ratings-3222270">He impressed in his first two games for the Robins</a> and in his first game back against Cardiff on November 10, but admits he could have been back sooner had he not pushed himself too hard during a previous international fixture.</p>
      <p><a href="https://en.mlsz.hu/hir/exciting-times-for-adam-nagy-at-home-and-abroad">He made the admission in an interview for the Hungarian Football Federation</a>, but admits he's now feeling back to full fitness.</p>
      <p>Nagy picked up the injury after a match against QPR on August 17, but was called up to the Hungarian national squad for a game against Slovakia despite not being fit.</p>
      <p>He played and aggravated the injury, <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/bristol-citys-lee-johnson-blasts-3334317">leaving Robins boss Lee Johnson furious.</a> After the Slovakia game, Johnson said: "It was annoying really, he comes back from Hungary and I wasn't happy with that situation at all.</p>
      <p>"But it is what it is. International takes precedence, even though we pay the wages, and it's a classic argument."</p>
      <h3>Aggravating the injury</h3>
      <p>Nagy said: "There's no pain or discomfort.</p>
      <p>"The interior and anterior ligaments in the ankle were damaged but unfortunately there was also an extra bit of bone left in there from an earlier, childhood injury and this slowed the regeneration and recovery.</p>
      <p>"Unfortunately, for several reasons, I think I was out for longer than I needed to be, but now I feel I've totally recovered and I can play without any complaints.</p>
      <p>"Obviously the final decision (to play against Slovakia in September) was absolutely mine and I took that decision because I wanted to play and because I knew just how crucial, how important a game, awaited us.</p>
      <p>"However, the decision I made set my rehabilitation, my recovery, back. It was a decision I took on my own and I'm just happy that I can put it all behind me now.</p>

      <p>"It's something a person can learn from, so if I find myself in a similar situation in years to come, I'll know what decision to make. At the same time, I still need a little time - such as Friday's 25-30 minutes on the pitch - for my body and mind to get up to speed so that in my head I can think quickly, and make the right decisions when I'm playing, and this will come with matches.</p>
      <p>"I'm very happy that I was able to play for my club last weekend too, so now I feel that I'm back on track".</p>
      <h3>Hoping to 'tease' Ashley Williams</h3>
      <p>Nagy, who joined <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/sport/football/lee-johnsons-tinkering-works-bristol-3548591">City</a> in the summer from Bologna, said he is looking forward to the prospect of facing fellow Robin Ashley Williams when Hungary face Wales tonight.</p>
      <p>Both teams need a win to qualify for the European Championships after Wales won against Azerbaijan on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Williams has been in fine form for City this season, but Nagy says he hopes to be able to take the bragging rights.</p>
      <p>He said: "Of course, I've spoken with Ashley about it and interestingly our last club match was away in the Cardiff City Stadium, so after the match we said to each other in the dressing room that we'd meet at the stadium again in ten days' time, but on opposing sides this time, not in the same team.</p>
      <p>"I very much hope I'll be the one smiling at the end and that I'll be able to tease him a bit about us beating them".</p>
      <h3>Aiming for promotion with City</h3>
      <p>Following his return from injury, Nagy is looking to play his part in getting the Robins promoted.</p>
      <p>He admits it's tight at the top, but says promotion has been the aim since the start of the season and nothing has changed.</p>

      <p>He said: "At the beginning of the year, the club said it was aiming for promotion and finished just outside the play-off places. That is obviously the aim this season too, ideally automatically via a top-two finish or via the play-offs.</p>
      <p>"It's very tight at the top of the Championship with five points separating the leaders and us in sixth place, so I'm very much hoping for a successful year ahead with both my club and my national team".</p>
