      <p>A woman kidnapped by her stepfather at the age of 11 has revealed how she managed to escape by befriending a couple in the supermarket.</p>
      <p>Rosalynn McGinnis, now 33, was abducted from school by Henri Piette, 65, and taken to Mexico, where he then forced her to ‘marry’ him and fathered nine children with her.</p>
      <p>For almost two decades, she was repeatedly physically and sexually abused while living in a filthy tent, undetected by US authorities.</p>
      <p>It wasn’t until 2016 when she met married couple, Lisa and Ian, living in Oaxaca, Mexico, that she managed to make her escape, as the pair realised ‘something’ wasn’t right with the family.</p>

      <p>During a new interview on The Dr Oz Show, Rosalynn described how she and Piette had stood in front of the couple at a supermarket with their ‘bunch of kids’.</p>

      <p>She said: ‘[They noticed] the age difference and all the children. Actually, we were short on the bill to pay for the groceries and they paid it for us.</p>
      <p>‘They asked where we lived. It started like that. Henri was the type that always kept people away. But they knew something wasn’t right.’</p>
      <p>The couple befriended Rosalynn and when Piette later forced the family to move location, they made sure to find out where she’d gone.</p>
      <p>Rosalynn said: ‘We moved and they found out where we were and she’s like I know there’s something wrong. If you can ever get away, I’ll help you.’</p>
      <p>Lisa previously described how the children had been ‘skinny as rakes’ and were all living in ‘three cubicles that were little more than walk-in closet size’.</p>

      <p>The children also told her that Piette ‘didn’t love any of them’, she said.</p>

      <p>Lisa then worked out how old Rosalynn must have been when she had her oldest child with Piette and alarm bells started ringing.</p>
      <p>She later found a missing person’s poster from 1997 with Rosalynn’s name on it.</p>
      <p>This caused her to offer to help, resulting in the mum-of-nine later fleeing to her house with eight of her children, as the eldest boy had already run away.</p>
      <p>During The Dr Oz Show, Rosalynn explained how she only told the children the ‘truth’ about her abuse when they escaped from Mexico.</p>

      <p>She said: ‘They were really shocked. They’ve been through [a lot], especially my older children.</p>
      <p>‘The reason I didn’t tell them, of course, was because what I knew inside was how much it’s damaged me. I didn’t want them to grow up knowing that.’</p>
      <p>She continued: ‘[Piette] would tell them they’re animals. He would treat them like animals. That the only reason that they’re alive is because your mother’s here.</p>
      <p>‘Otherwise, if she wasn’t there, I’d kill all of you. He would hit them and then I would step in and it would just be horrible.’</p>
      <p>Piette abducted Rosalynn as a form of revenge on her mum, who he had abused in their marriage.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year he was found guilty of kidnapping and travel with intent to engage in a sexual act with a juvenile.</p>

      <p>He has also been charged with lewd molestation, child abuse and first-degree rape.</p>
      <p>If found guilty, he is likely to face life in prison.</p>
