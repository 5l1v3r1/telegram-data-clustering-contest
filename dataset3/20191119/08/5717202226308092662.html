      <h1>Harry Redknapp backs Dele Alli to come good and defends his work rate</h1>
      <h2>Alli has two goals to his name this season and has faced criticism.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T08:15:56+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 08:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/sam-preston/" target="_blank">Sam Preston</a></address>
      <p>Former Tottenham manager Harry Redknapp has defended midfielder Dele Alli after a slow start to the season cost him his England place.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10364282/harry-redknapp-dele-alli-tottenham-top-four/">In the Sun</a>, Redknapp hit back at critics of the playmaker, who were at their most vocal after Tottenham’s 2-1 loss at Anfield last month.</p>
      <p>He <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10364282/harry-redknapp-dele-alli-tottenham-top-four/">said</a>: “Dele is striking a bit of form again. He is a key player for me, I’m such a fan of his. They tell me he is a great lad as well. He got badly criticised for his performance at Liverpool but he covered more yards than any other player by so much it was ridiculous. And yet he got criticised for not running or working hard after the game.</p>
      <p>“When you looked at it he had certainly put a shift in. It’s not gone well but I think he’s a good kid and a good trainer. His form has dipped. He hit such high standards a year or two before. If he can get back to that form again then that would be a major boost.”</p>

      <h3>TBR’s View – Plenty of criticism of Alli is lazy</h3>
      <p>When a young player like Alli suffers a drop-off, plenty of pundits tend to reach for their lazy stereotypes; the fame went to his head, he lost his hunger, he believed his own hype and so on.</p>
      <p>Perhaps there’s an element of that with Alli but as Redknapp says, he is putting in the effort during tough games and a tough period for Tottenham.</p>
      <p>He is showing plenty more than Christian Eriksen, who is playing like a man who doesn’t want to be there, and if Mauricio Pochettino needs a creator to reinvigorate his attack, Alli should be the man.</p>
