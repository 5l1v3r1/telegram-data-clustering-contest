      <h1>Riders chase new adrenaline thrill at Pondarosa</h1>
      <h2>At Pondarosa Ranch this weekend, a great turnout of riders were chasing a new adrenalin rush called stadium eventing.</h2>

      <p>Eventing is the only sport where you wear your medical information strapped to your arm. Not even racing drivers do that.</p>

      <p>This is a compacted version of the normal cross-country phase of eventing. It might be a shorter version, but it still showcases all the action and adrenalin of the real thing.</p>

      <p>Cross-country obstacles such as logs, bushes, steps and even boats, in all shapes and sizes, tested riders’ ability to guide their horses over or through safely.</p>

      <p>It was a great opportunity for equestrians to pit themselves against these unusual obstacles on uneven ground that can test the nerves far more than standard arena jumps. This was as exciting for spectators as it was for the riders competing.</p>

      <p>Show organiser, Sean Eggersglusz, said he was very happy and grateful for the support received from riders of the province, and even a handful of riders that travelled all the way from Hoedspruit to attend the two-day show.</p>

      <p>The show kicked off on Saturday morning with dressage. Judge Alayne MaClayne was impressed with the overall level of riding and performances.</p>

      <p>She is a strict judge and her scores reflected this. Although there were no outstanding scores, the average was good and the comments received from her showed that the Lowveld has great potential with regards to dressage horses and riders.</p>

      <p>The showjumping classes followed shortly after the dressage. Eggersglusz put hard work into the jumping arena and the going was very good, especially after the rain the previous day. Technical courses forced the riders to think on their feet.</p>

      <p>The first class consisted of the grassroots riders, with the youngest rider not even two years old yet.<br/>As these tiny tots trotted proudly around, with the ponies being led by handlers over poles on the ground, the crowd showed its appreciation for the little ones’ courage.</p>
      <p>The jumping ended at a spectacular height of 1,3 metres. Natasha Whyte on White Waters Only You effortlessly flew around these high courses. On Sunday the show concluded with the action-packed stadium eventing classes.</p>

      <p>After that, would- be eventing riders had the opportunity to try their hand at the real cross-country courses that were set up on the property.</p>
