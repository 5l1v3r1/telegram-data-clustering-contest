      <p>Juventus are also likely to part ways with veteran striker Mario Mandzukic in exchange for the Frenchman – and as Mandzukic and United have expressed a mutual liking for each other, it seems likely that they will arrange a deal for both players during the January transfer window.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Real Madrid manager Zinedine Zidane has also not yet given up on the chase for the 26-year-old, after failing to sign him during the summer transfer window. Back then, the Red Devils’ boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was not really inclined to sell his best player, which is why he named an asking price of €180million for him – a price which was considered very high by Real Madrid President Florentino Perez, who then pulled the plug on a potential deal.</p>
