      <p>We lost. The gadgets won.</p>
      <p>I'm saying that facetiously, I admit. I'm an avid tech user and see the benefits of using these tools for work. The irony is that, when they become more than tools, I get a little nervous. When <a href="https://www.inc.com/john-brandon/forget-smartphone-addiction-heres-what-experts-are-really-worried-about.html">I wrote about screen addiction not long ago</a>, quite a few readers noted how they are hopelessly hooked as well. The main finding in that article was that there is a trigger. We really like getting micro-feedback. It fuels our gadget obsessions.</p>
      <p>Recently, I came across a few sobering stats that made me wonder if the problem is getting worse. As you look these over, think about which ones resonate with you the most--and more importantly, what we can do about it.</p>
