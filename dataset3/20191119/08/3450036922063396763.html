      <p>Kirksville, Mo. — For the second year in a row, the Kirksville Menards is teaming up with the <a href="https://www.nmcaa.org/">Community Action Partnership of Northeast Missouri </a>for a Christmas Toy Drive.</p>
      <p>The Menards store in Kirksville will act as a drop off location for any toy donations, while CAPNEMO will be responsible for finding the less fortunate families from the community who the donations will go to.</p>
      <p>They’re looking for toys for kids of all ages and hope to give out 450 to 500 toys to children around the Kirksville community.</p>
      <p>We spoke with Menards manager Kirt Marshall about the drive.</p>
      <blockquote>"We hope to be able to collect these for the less fortunate children, and make them a happy Christmas."</blockquote>
      <p>This year the drive will last until December 9 and the drop box is located at the front of the Menards store in Kirksville.</p>
      <p>While it’s only the second year this toy drive has been held at the Kirksville location, Kirt told us that the drive has been going on at other locations for over a decade.</p>
      <p>Kirt also said that toys for teenagers are usually the hardest to give out so he’s asking that people keep the teenagers in mind if they want to donate this year.</p>
