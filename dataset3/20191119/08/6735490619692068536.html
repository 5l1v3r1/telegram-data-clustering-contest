      <p>It was a late-night crossover event for the ages.</p>
      <p>On Monday night, “Late Night” host Seth Meyers appeared as a guest on “The Tonight Show”, where he and Jimmy Fallon played a game of “Think Fast!”.</p>

      <p>Each TV host had to ask the other a series of rapid-fire questions, with the other person responding with the first thing to pop in their head.</p>
      <p>Things got very silly, very fast, of course.</p>

      <p>Later during their interview, Meyers talked about his once-in-a-lifetime experience of going day drinking with Rihanna.</p>
      <p>“Is there one thing that she doesn’t do well?” Fallon asked him.</p>

      <p>There was one thing, Meyers said, revealing, “She, at one point, took my phone and took a bunch of pictures while we were day drinking. And then, when I went through them and looked at them, I’m like, ‘Rihanna’s bad at taking pictures.'”</p>
      <p>Fallon then showed off one of those pictures, a very blurry one of Meyers looking at something and smiling.</p>
