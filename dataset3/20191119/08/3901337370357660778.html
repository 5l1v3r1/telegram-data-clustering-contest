      <p>Belgium goalkeeper Simon Mignolet spent six years at Anfield after his arrival from Sunderland in 2013.</p>
      <p>The 31-year-old made 204 appearances for the club, 100 of which came under Klopp, but he appears to have a bitter taste in his mouth regarding his last season in England.</p>
      <p>Mignolet played just twice for the Reds in the 2018/19 campaign following the big-money signing of Brazil goalkeeper Alisson, and the Belgian seemingly feels that Klopp was never going to give him a fair chance to compete with the former Roma shot-stopper for the No. 1 spot. Â </p>
      <p>"If I could really fight for my place, I might have stayed," he told Belgian newspaper <i>Het Belang van Limburg.</i></p>
      <p>"But if I had ended up in goal if Alisson picked up injury, I would be allowed to push 10 shots out of the box.</p>
      <p>"Then Alisson could immediately claim his place again. And even if he pushed the ball into his own goal, he would still retain (his place in the starting XI).</p>
      <p>"What sense did it make for me?"</p>

      </p>
      <p>The Belgian also explained why he does not regret leaving Liverpool.</p>
      <p>"No, because I knew that the opportunity existed," Mignolet conitnued.</p>
      <p>"I haven't thought once: 'S**t, now Liverpool is in the Premier League race and I'm gone.'</p>
      <p>"Of course, I could have stayed with Liverpool to earn my money, challenge for the league title and the Champions League.</p>
      <p>"However, as long as you are not on the starting XI yourself, a price feels different. So I would rather play as a starter at Club Brugge than grabbing the English title as a substitute at Liverpool."</p>
