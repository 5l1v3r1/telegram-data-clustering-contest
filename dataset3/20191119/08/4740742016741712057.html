      <p>A distraught owner has issued a desperate appeal to find her three kittens after they were 'stolen' from her stables.</p>
      <p>Amber Clark, from <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/hanham">Hanham</a>, took in the tabby cats from a friend and was keeping them in her stables based in <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/thornbury">Thornbury.</a></p>
      <p>But to her horror, when she arrived on Saturday (November 16) to feed her new pets they had vanished.</p>
      <p>Amber fears the worst after learning other animals have been mutilated in the area over the past month.</p>

      <p>And her six-year-old autistic son has been left extremely anxious and distressed by their disappearence.</p>
      <p>"We just want to know they are OK," said Amber. "They were so young we didn't even know what gender they were.</p>
      <p>"We were waiting until they were a bit older to take them to the vets.</p>
      <p>"My son wakes up every morning and asks if the kittens are back yet and every night he says before bed I hope the kittens come back tonight.</p>
      <p>"They were staying in our stables where they had fresh hay, lots of water - you name it they had it.</p>
      <p>"They were amazing and then some cruel person entered private property and stole them.</p>

      <p>"I'm worried sick, obviously I want them home but mostly I want to know they are safe.</p>
      <p>"I also want to warn other people that this happened in case whoever did it does it again."</p>
      <p>Amber last saw the kittens at lunchtime on Friday.</p>
      <p>She has reported the incident to police and anyone with information should call 101 quoting crime reference 5219265415 or email minx3741@gmail.com.</p>
