      <h1>Albanian teen trafficked into UK must answer bail on Christmas Day</h1>
      <h2>The petition to keep the young Bristol City fan here is now past 162,000</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T08:27:47+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 08:27</time> by <a rel="author">Tristan Cork</a></address>
      <p>The foster father of a teenager who is fighting to be allowed to stay in Britain has been told he has to take him to answer bail on Christmas Day.</p>
      <p>Foster carer John Stokes has said his family’s Christmas plans will now revolve around taking his foster son Samet from their home in <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/yate">Yate </a>to Patchway police centre on Christmas Day, to report to immigration authorities.</p>
      <p>And that will include the uncertainty of not knowing whether <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/christmas">Christmas Day</a> could be the day the Home Office decide to detain the 18-year-old, with a view to deporting him back to his native Albania.</p>
      <p>Samet has become the subject of unprecedented support, with the <a href="https://www.change.org/p/save-my-foster-son-samet-he-is-family?recruiter=1010398873">number of people signing a petition</a> demanding he should be allowed to remain in Britain <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/bristol-city-sanet-petition-signatures-3493695">now soaring above 162,000</a>.</p>
      <p>When <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/want-save-samet-people-traffickers-3450925">Bristol Live first told Samet’s story</a>, only a couple of hundred John’s family, friends and supporters had signed.</p>
      <p>But with backing from the likes of <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/tv-star-joe-backs-young-3483916">local actor and TV star Joe Sims</a>, the Mayor of Bristol <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/marvin-rees">Marvin Rees</a>, and supporters and <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/update-case-trafficked-teen-samet-3513138">former players at Bristol City</a>, where Samet is a fan, tens of thousands of people have signed up to the petition asking for a rethink.</p>

      <p>Samet was trafficked into this country alone at the age of 15, and ended up in the care of John Stokes, a <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/south-gloucestershire">South Gloucestershire</a> foster carer, who has taken in more than 60 children in a carer career spanning three decades.</p>
      <p>Samet, who suffers from PTSD as a result of his childhood experiences, went to school and now attends SGS College in <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/filton">Filton</a>, where he is training to become a carpenter, and hopes to settle down with John and his family.</p>
      <p>But when Samet turned 18, the Home Office ruled he could not have leave to remain in Britain, and told him he had to return to Albania.</p>
      <p>“Samet’s childhood was stolen by beatings and abuse he faced,” said John.</p>
      <p>“He ended up being forced to beg on the streets of Albania at 11 years of age, before he was sold into slavery and trafficked into the UK at 15. He has now restarted his life with us in the UK - we are a family. But now the Home Office are trying to deport him. We are trying to reverse this decision,” he added.</p>
      <p>Samet has now been instructed to report at regular intervals to the reporting centre at Filton police station, and each time it could be the time when he is detained. The family lost an appeal recently, but are challenging that decision in the Court of Appeal in London.</p>

      <p>Mr Stokes said the campaign for Samet highlighted the plight of many boys who were trafficked into this country as children, often from Albania, allowed to stay, settle down and build lives in Britain, and then told to return to Albania as soon as they turn 18.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, more than 100,000 people signed a petition to call for another Albanian teenager, Stiven Bregu, to stay after he turned 18, and <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/news/bristol-news/stiven-bregu-bristol-petition-deportation-3151057">that was successful</a>.</p>
      <p>“We’re having to arrange Christmas Day around taking Samet to answer bail at lunchtime,” he said.</p>
      <p>“Happy Christmas from the Home Office - sadly they have already destroyed many similar young lives and many more fear becoming 18,” added Mr Stokes. “I hope that with growing awareness more people try and put an end to these awful and dehumanising Home Office procedures.</p>
      <p>"We have been told he has to answer bail every fourth Wednesday - and in December that's Christmas Day - or face arrest for breach of bail. It does not say any alternatives," he added</p>
      <p>The Home Office have been contacted about Samet’s case and said they were not able to comment while the legal process was continuing.</p>
