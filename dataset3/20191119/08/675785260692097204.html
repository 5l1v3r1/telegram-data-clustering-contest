      <h1>Juventus 'to raise Paul Pogba transfer' during Mario Mandzukic talks with Man Utd</h1>
      <h2>Juventus are aware of Paul Pogba's interest in returning and will discuss his future when they meet with Man Utd to resolve Mario Mandzukic's transfer</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T08:53:42+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 08:53</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Meade</a></address>
      <p>Juventus will discuss the possibility of bringing Paul Pogba back to Turin when they hold talks with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> over a deal for Mario Mandzukic.</p>
      <p>The Frenchman has made it clear that he sees his future away from Old Trafford having expressed his desire to seek a new challenge in the summer.</p>
      <p>United stood firm as they maintained their record signing would not be sold despite mounting interest from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a>.</p>
      <p>Pogba has since been seen in Dubai With Zinedine Zidane in a meeting that, according to the pair, was complete coincidence.</p>
      <p>But despite Madrid readying another bid it now looks as if Pogba would prefer a return to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> rather than joining up with the La Liga giants.</p>

      <p>United, meanwhile, are looking to add a striker in January with veteran frontman Mandzukic ready to leave Juventus having been marginalised by Maurizio Sarri.</p>
      <p>And the Serie A champions, who are aware of Pogba's interest in returning, are ready to begin testing United's resolve when they meet according to the <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7700773/Juventus-test-Man-United-stance-selling-Paul-Pogba-talks-Mario-Mandzukic-move.html">Daily Mail</a> .</p>
      <p>Reports in Italy understand that the World Cup winner is desperate to leave Old Trafford and would not shun Los Blancos were they his only option.</p>

      <p>But his preference is to return to the side with whom he spent four years with and helped guide to a Champions League final in 2015.</p>
      <p>Current United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has, despite Pogba's outspoken comments, maintained he has no issue with his star midfielder and refused to be drawn on the idea he could quit the club.</p>
      <p>Pogba is currently sidelined with an ankle injury meaning he has made just six appearances this term.</p>
      <p>United were languishing in the bottom half of the Premier League until two recent wins, but qualifying for the Champions League already looks a tall order.</p>
