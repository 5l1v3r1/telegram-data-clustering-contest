      <p>A Moscow City Court has upheld a court decision to prolong the pretrial detention of Paul Whelan, a U.S. citizen charged in Russia with espionage, until December 29.</p>
      <p>Lawyers for the detained former U.S. Marine, who has rejected the charges, had argued at an appeal hearing on November 19 that Whelan should be subjected to a less restrictive detention, such as house arrest.</p>
      <p>"The resolution of the Moscow Lefortovo district court is upheld, and the appeal is dismissed," the Moscow City Court said in its ruling, according to Interfax.</p>
      <p>Whelan, who also holds Canadian, Irish, and British citizenship, has accused prison guards of abuse during his incarceration.</p>
      <p>The 49-year-old was arrested in a hotel room in Moscow in December 2018 and accused of receiving classified information.</p>
      <p>He was charged with espionage, which carries a sentence of up to 20 years in prison. Whelan's family said he was in Moscow at the time for a wedding.</p>
      <p>Whelan in the past has complained of poor conditions in prison and of abuse and his lawyer has said that his client needs surgery.</p>
      <p>The U.S. Embassy in Moscow on July 1 said its request for an independent medical examination of Whelan had been denied, noting that his condition had deteriorated.</p>
      <p>In April, the embassy called on Russia to "stop playing games" and provide proof of Whelan's alleged espionage.</p>
