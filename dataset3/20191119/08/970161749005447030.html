        <b><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/mohamed-salah/">Mohamed Salah</a> and Andrew Robertson are injury doubts for Liverpoolâ€™s trip to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/crystal-palace-fc/">Crystal Palace</a> in the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> this weekend as both are still recovering from ankle problems.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Egyptian and the Scot both sat out of international fixtures over the last week as they dealt with their respective ankle issues.</p>
      <p>However, while they are both nearing returns to fitness, they have not yet been passed fit for the visit to Selhurst Park on Saturday afternoon, reports the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/mohamed-salah-andy-robertson-injury-17274638?fbclid=IwAR3inSkkz1J1M4c0P1MMkpqAexptf9m1K_YpZPKroeYH__w8yfcO0fEOBo0">Liverpool Echo.</a></p>
      <p>Both Salah and Robertson have been dealing with their ankle problems for a number of week, and both saw their issues worsen in the win over Manchester City on 10 November.</p>
      <p>Robertson made it through the full 90 minutes of that contest, with Salah being substituted near the conclusion of the match as a precaution.</p>
      <p>With just under two weeks of rest, both men are pushing to be available for the trip to south London, but may be saved for the Champions League clash with Napoli at Anfield the following Wednesday.</p>

      <p>There is better news over Joe Gomez, who withdrew from the England squad due to a knee injury, but scans show there is no lasting damage from the problem.</p>

      <p>The defender is almost certainly available for the Crystal Palace game and could be asked to fill in at left-back if Robertson is not back to fitness, or in central defence with Joel Matip still out with a knee problem.</p>
      <p>Midfielders Jordan Henderson and Goerginio Wijnaldum have both been struggling with illness but neither is expected to miss the Eagles clash.</p>
      <p>Xherdan Shaqiri is also expected to be available to Jurgen Klopp again after injury, although the Swiss is yet to start a Premier League game this season.</p>
