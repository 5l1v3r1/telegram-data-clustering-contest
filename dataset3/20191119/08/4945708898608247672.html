      <p>Snap on Monday confirmed that it checks political ads at Snapchat to make sure they are not deceptive or misleading and thus enforce its ban on such material.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/strategy/">strategy</a> seems to be a middle ground between Facebook's controversial tolerance of proven lies in political ads and Twitter's decision to ban them all together.</p>
      <p>"We subject all <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/advertising/">advertising</a> to review, including <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/political+advertising/">political advertising</a>," Snap chief executive Evan Spiegel said in a story published by CNBC.</p>
      <p>"And I think what we try to do is create a place for political ads on our platform, especially because we reach so many <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/young+people/">young people</a> and first-time voters we want them to be able to engage with the political conversation, but we don't allow things like misinformation to appear in that advertising."</p>
      <p>Snap policies prohibit political ads that are deceptive or misleading, with an in-house team reviewing such paid messages to make sure they don't break the rules.</p>
      <p>Twitter last week said its ban on political ads will exempt "caused-based" messages on topics related to social or environmental issues.</p>
      <p>The San Francisco-based messaging platform plans to bar all paid political messages starting November 22, while addressing concerns expressed by activists for social causes.</p>
      <p>"Ads that educate, raise awareness, and/or call for people to take action in connection with civic engagement, economic growth, environmental stewardship, or social equity causes are allowed," Twitter said in its new policy.</p>
      <p>"However, they may not reference prohibited political advertisers or political content."</p>
      <p>Twitter announced the political ad ban on October 30, saying the move was aimed at countering the spread of misinformation by politicians.</p>
      <p>The political ban has drawn mixed reactions: some argue it puts pressure on Facebook to follow suit or take other steps to curb the spread of misinformation from politicians; others say a ban will be difficult to enforce.</p>
      <p>Social media platforms have been challenged by President Donald Trump's campaign and its use of ads that contain claims which critics say have been debunked by independent fact-checkers.</p>
      <p>Some analysts point out that the ban will not affect "organic" content, or <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/messages/">messages</a> from politicians that are shared or retweeted by supporters, and that it could encourage the use of "bots" or paid users to amplify the tweets.</p>
      <p>Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said political advertising is not a major source of revenue but adds that he believes it is important to allow everyone a "voice," and that banning <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/political+ads/">political ads</a> would favor incumbents.</p>
