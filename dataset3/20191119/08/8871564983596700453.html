      <h1>Court of Appeals rejects plea to have activist released after being arrested without warrant</h1>

      <p>The Court of Appeals (CA) has rejected an appeal by Arnulfo Pacalda to have his daughter, 23-year-old activist Alexandrea Pacalda, released from the Philippine Military’s custody, despite her having been arrested without a warrant in September.</p>
      <p>In a decision yesterday, the CA’s Third Division said Alexandrea cannot be released because she is facing criminal charges that were filed by the authorities in Catanuan town, Quezon province. A member of the feminist group Gabriela Youth, <a href="https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/news/nation/715926/ca-junks-activist-dad-s-plea-to-release-his-daughter-alexandrea-from-military-custody/story/">she was charged</a> with violating Republic Act 9516, or the illegal possession, manufacture, and sale of firearms.</p>

      <p>“Once the person detained is duly charged in court, he may no longer question his detention by a petition for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus,” <a href="https://news.mb.com.ph/2019/11/19/ca-junks-release-of-student-suspected-as-npa-member/">the court said</a>. “In fine, the petition praying for the release of Alexandrea from detention loses legal mooring and is rendered moot and academic by the subsequent information [or criminal charges] filed against her before the regional trial court Branch 96 of Catanuan, Quezon…. It thus becomes unnecessary to pass upon the other issues raised in the petition.”</p>
      <p>The concept of habeas corpus is meant to ensure that those detained have a right to appear before a judge to determine whether they are being lawfully detained.</p>

      <p>Alexandrea, a former student journalist at the Manuel Enverga University in  Lucena City, <a href="https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/11/19/19/ca-rejects-fathers-plea-for-release-of-activist-arrested-without-warrant">was arrested without a warrant</a> in September from the town of General Luna in Quezon by six armed men wearing civilian clothing. The men were later identified to be members of the Army, <i>ABS-CBN </i>reported.</p>
      <p>Arnulfo alleged that his daughter was tortured by his abductors, while the military claims she was a member of the rebel group New People’s Army who had chosen to surrender. However, in a video that Alexandrea sent to <i>The Philippine Daily Inquirer, </i>she said <a href="https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1166959/detained-activist-says-she-was-deprived-of-sleep-food-for-up-to-30-hours">she was deprived of food</a> and sleep for up to 30 hours by the military, and that the soldiers allegedly forced her to sign a false affidavit in which she confessed to being an NPA rebel.</p>
      <p>According to Arnulfo, his daughter remains in detention at the headquarters of the 201st Brigade in Calauag, Quezon.</p>
