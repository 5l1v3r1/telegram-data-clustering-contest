      <p>Richmond premiership player Jacob Townsend looks poised to join Essendon.</p>
      <p>Industry sources have confirmed Townsend, 26, is in the sights of the Bombers, having visited the club's Tullamarine base earlier this month.</p>
      <p>The 2017 premiership forward played just one senior game for the Tigers this year but was part of their VFL premiership.</p>

      <p>The Dons would be Townsend's third AFL club after he spent four seasons at Greater Western Sydney.</p>
      <p>Essendon delisted Mitch Brown last month, while <a href="https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/link/follow-20170101-p53b2b.html">Michael Hartley walked from the club</a> and is set to join Hawthorn.</p>
      <p>Brown will meanwhile train with Melbourne in a bid to keep his AFL career alive.</p>
