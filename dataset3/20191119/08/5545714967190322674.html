      <p>You can't keep a good dog down. After a stint on Xbox One and PC, this year's <i>Blair Witch </i>game from Bloober Team is coming to PlayStation 4 on December 3. It's once again hitting that $30 sweet spot.</p>

      <p>What's new on PS4? A few things, actually.</p>
      <p>Bloober Team is promising gameplay and technical enhancements for this belated port – you love to see it – along with some cosmetic options for <i>Blair Witch</i>'s canine buddy, Bullet. The appropriately named if slightly groan-worthy "Good Boy Pack" will be available on Xbox One and Steam as well.</p>
      <p>As for the quality of the game itself, I put it off because I'm not into <i>Blair Witch</i>, but Patrick, our reviewer, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../review-blair-witch-567600.phtml">thought it turned out well</a> despite its pacing issues. In short: "the amazing set pieces and psychological horror do a great job of raising the heart rate of anyone willing to venture through the forest."</p>
      <p>Keep your dog safe, find a missing boy in the woods, and don't let your imagination spook you.</p>
