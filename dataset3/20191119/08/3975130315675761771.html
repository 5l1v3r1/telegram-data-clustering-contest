The presenter states that computer scientists are very interested in holograms because the future of digital data storage may lie in them. This was 35 years ago. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holographic_data_storage">Holographic data storage</a> for PCs, smartphones, etc. still is not available commercially. Why is this? Are data storage holograms too difficult to create? Or did nobody do enough research on the subject, getting us all stuck with mechanical hard disks and SSDs instead? Where are the hologram drives that appeared "so promising" three decades ago?</i></p>
