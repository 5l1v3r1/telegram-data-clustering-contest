      <p>Coldplay are celebrating <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/19/coldplay-tease-new-music-fans-cant-wait-new-era-band-10947151/">the release of their new album</a>, Everyday Life, by performing at London’s Natural History Museum next week.</p>
      <p>And fans are absolutely beside themselves at the news.</p>
      <p>The Fix You singers will be blessing us with their eighth album on 22 November, before whacking out some of their biggest hits at the prestigious museum.</p>
      <p>Not only that, but the proceeds will be going towards environmental charity Client Earth.</p>
      <p>Your favourites could never.</p>
      <p>The band announced the gig on social media, telling fans: ‘Coldplay, Live at the Natural History Museum, London 25 November, 2019.</p>
      <p>‘Exclusive ticket access to UK fans who pre-order (or have already pre-ordered) Everyday Life from the Official Coldplay Store, before Friday, 22 November.</p>

      <p>‘All proceeds from the Natural History Museum show on 25 November will go towards the work of @ClientEarth, an environmental charity which uses the power of the law to protect the planet and its people.’</p>

      <p>Right on cue, fans went into total meltdown at the news, with one replying: ‘So exciting, thank you for this. Just got to try and get a ticket now.’</p>
      <p>‘This makes so much sense! Art playing in a museum,’ another commented.</p>
      <p>While one screamed: ‘OMG YES THANK YOU I’VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR YEARS.’</p>
      <p>And many, many more begged the band to perform in their home towns.</p>

      <p>The news comes after Chris Martin broke all our hearts when <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/cleared-coldplay-isnt-playing-glastonbury-festival-2020-11091560/">he confirmed that Coldplay would not be playing at Glastonbury 2020</a> – and we are utterly devastated.</p>
      <p>The 42-year-old frontman appeared on Australian radio breakfast show Nova 96.6 when he told listeners: ‘We won’t be playing at Glastonbury 50 – although, I’ll probably be there because I love going.</p>
      <p>‘It’s like our home…but we won’t be playing.’</p>
      <p>So if you were lucky enough to snag tickets, you still might be able to see the band – just not on stage.</p>
      <p>While Coldplay won’t be performing next June, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/paul-mccartney-basically-confirms-headlining-glastonbury-2020-rather-cryptic-message-11175429/">Glastonbury-goers will be watching Paul McCartney headline the festival</a> at Worthy Farm.</p>
      <p>Emily Eavis shared the news on Twitter, after months of speculation, telling fans the Beatles legend will be performing on the Saturday night.</p>
      <p>‘IT’S REAL!! So excited.. Having Paul McCartney coming back to headline the Pyramid next year is an absolute dream come true,’ she wrote on Instagram</p>

      <p>‘There really was no one that we wanted more for the 50th anniversary @ Glastonbury Festival.’</p>
      <p>Bring. It. On.</p>
