      <p>The lovebirds have been going steady for some time and had always planned on being parents.</p>
      <p>Chloe divulged the couple decided to try for a baby sooner because she wanted to have the "best chance" of becoming a mum.</p>
      <p>She added: "I knew I needed to get rid of the abnormal cells and have the op but it was stressful because I worried I wouldn't be able to carry a child full-term. It sparked me into trying sooner to give myself the best chance."</p>

      <p>She had been with her former partner Jordan Clarke at the time.</p>
