      <p>Diego Maradona, Argentine idol, is reportedly set to quit Gimnasia as manager barely two months he took over the affairs of the club.</p>
      <p>Maradona, who has not coached any team in his homeland since 1995, was <a href="https://www.legit.ng/1258650-diego-maradona-unveiled-manager-argentine-club-club-de-gimnasia.html">unveiled as the new manager of the club</a> in an emotional ceremony held at the club's stadium.</p>
      <p>But the 59-year-old is reported to have met with family members and friends on his future with the Argentine top-flight.</p>

      <p>According to UK Sun quoting local report from Argentina, Maradona has begun his resignation process but he is being held down by the club's last three matches of 2019.</p>
      <p>The Argentine legend's decision is attributed to a rumour that current Gimnasia President Gabriel Pellegrino will seek not re-election in the coming poll.</p>
