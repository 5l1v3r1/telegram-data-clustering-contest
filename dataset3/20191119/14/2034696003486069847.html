        <b>"I literally had to learn how to walk again. I was extremely sick."</b>
      </p>
      <p><a href="http://nme.com/artists/elton-john">Elton John</a> has said he had to learn to walk again after contracting a serious infection following surgery for prostate cancer surgery.</p>
      <p>The music icon previously revealed how <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/elton-john-prostate-cancer-infection-2554201">he underwent the successful operation two years ago</a>, but came close to death after falling ill on tour in South America.</p>
      <p>He said he was “24 hours from snuffing it” in 2017 and was rushed back to the UK to be treated in intensive care.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Graham Norton for new BBC programme <i>Elton John: Uncensored</i>, he revealed: “I had to learn to walk again. I was extremely sick.”</p>
      <p>Elton also explained how a show in Las Vegas after the operation saw him being forced to wear nappies.</p>
      <p>“I was on stage in Vegas in a lot of pain, fluid had built up under my colon. I did the show and was wearing nappies shortly after the operation. I thought ‘If only they knew right now that I’m pissing myself’.”</p>

      <p>He joked that he was “like the Bionic Woman” as he has had his tonsils, colon and appendix removed.</p>
      <p>He said: “I literally had to learn how to walk again. I was extremely sick. All I could think about when I was lying in my hospital bed was ‘please don’t let me die, I want to see my children’, and luckily I survived it.</p>
      <p>“Now I’m fine but there’s very few bits of me left. There’s no hair, there’s a pacemaker, there’s no tonsils, there’s no prostate, there’s no appendix, I’ve had kidney stones. I like the Bionic Woman.”</p>
      <p>This comes after Elton discussed his battles with drugs and alcohol in recent memoir ‘Me’. The book sees him recalling the time he hijacked<a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/elton-john-hijacked-rolling-stones-gig-while-high-on-cocaine-2555067"> a Rolling Stones show while high on cocaine</a>, as well as the moment when he <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/elton-john-tried-to-give-scruffy-bob-dylan-a-makeover-after-mistaking-him-for-his-gardener-2555242">mistook Bob Dylan for his gardener while high</a> – describing him as “scruffy”.</p>
      <p>He also discussed his fears that he would<a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/elton-john-feared-he-wouldnt-be-able-to-perform-sober-after-addiction-treatment-2564999"> not be able to perform sober after undergoing treatment for addiction issues. </a></p>
      <p>Last month, it was seemingly confirmed that <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/elton-john-not-playing-glastonbury-2020-after-all-2560143">Elton will not play Glastonbury next year</a>, after newly announced farewell tour dates in the US seemingly clashed with the Worthy Farm festival.</p>
