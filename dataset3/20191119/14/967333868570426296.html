        <b>In April 2019 Patrick Carlineo, of upstate New York, was charged with threatening to kill Rep. Ilhan Omar, after allegedly calling the Minnesota Congresswoman’s office in March and telling a staffer Omar was a “terrorist”.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Patrick Carlineo, a resident of Addison, New York, who called<a href="https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201907311076419814-civil-rights-group-asks-jerusalem-court-to-ban-rep-ilhan-omar-from-entering-israel--report/"> Rep. Ilhan Omar’s office</a> and threatened to shoot her after calling her a “terrorist” pleaded guilty to the crime on 18 November, reported <i>AP</i>.</p>
      <blockquote>“He has taken responsibility for using threatening and inappropriate language to express [his] beliefs in this instance,” his lawyer Sonya Zoghlin said in a statement.</blockquote>
      <p>Zoghlin said Carlineo was passionate about his beliefs and has “taken responsibility for using threatening language to express them”, but never intended to harm Omar.</p>
      <p>Patrick Carlineo, 55, now faces up to 10 years in prison for the 21 March threat and is scheduled to be sentenced on 13 February.</p>
      <h3>Expletive-laden threat</h3>
      <p>Carlineo, 55, reportedly called Omar's Washington, DC, office on 21 March and told a staffer:</p>
      <blockquote>"Do you work for the Muslim Brotherhood? Why are you working for her, she's a f***ing terrorist. I'll put a bullet in her f***ing skull," according to a press release from the US Attorney’s office.</blockquote>
      <p>Carlineo had proceeded to give the staffer his name and contact information.</p>
      <p>After the call, Omar’s office alerted US Capitol Police, who launched a joint investigation with the FBI.</p>
      <p>Carlineo initially denied to FBI agents that he had threatened to shoot the Minnesota Democrat, reported <i>CBS Rochester</i>.</p>
      <p>He told investigators his exact words on the occasion had been "if our forefathers were still alive, they'd put a bullet in her head."</p>
      <blockquote>However, investigators told Carlineo that there was a recording of the phone call, prompting the man to backtrack and claim he could not remember exactly what he said.</blockquote>
      <p>The suspect also confessed to agents that he had a .22 caliber firearm and a shotgun in his home.</p>
      <p>The suspect later told federal investigators that he was a “patriot” and hated radical Muslims who are critical of President Trump.</p>
      <p>Before his call to Omar’s office, Carlineo had made frequent social media posts about what he saw as a danger posed to the US by the Muslim Brotherhood and alluding to violence against Muslims and US officials including former president Barack Obama, according to a <i>Guardian</i> report in April 2019.</p>
      <p>Rep. Ilhan Omar’s office has not commented on Carlineo’s admission.</p>

      <p>Omar, who represents Minnesota's 5th Congressional district and was among the first two Muslim women to serve in Congress, is Somali-American and wears a hijab.</p>
      <p>She has been <a href="https://sputniknews.com/radio_fault_lines/201908161076567640-rep-ilhan-omar-not-welcome-in-israel-rashida-tlaib-allowed-to-visit-family/">on the receiving end of harsh criticism</a> for remarks she made in recent months about Israel, Jewish influence in Washington, and 9/11.</p>
      <p>Omar subsequently apologised for suggesting that lawmakers support Israel for money, and has said that criticising the Israeli government is not anti-Semitic.</p>
