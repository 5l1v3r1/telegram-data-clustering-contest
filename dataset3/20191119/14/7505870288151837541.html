      <h1>Sale slashes popular Roborock robot vacuums as low as $240 for one day only</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T14:49:01+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 14:49</time> by <a rel="author">Maren Estrada</a></address>
      <p>Roborock made a name for itself by offering robot vacuums that are just as powerful as Roombas with even more features, but for slightly less money. Today, “slightly less” becomes “a whole heck of a lot less.” For one day only on Tuesday, Amazon is offering the lowest prices ever on two different popular Roborock models. The $350 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Roborock-E35-Robot-Vacuum-Mop/dp/B07PTP8GJ5?tag=b0c55-20">Roborock E35 Robot Vacuum and Mop</a> is down to just $239.99, while the high-end $600 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Roborock-Robotic-Connectivity-Navigating-Capacity/dp/B0792BWMV4?tag=b0c55-20">Roborock S5 Robotic Vacuum and Mop</a> gets a massive discount to $359.99. There’s a good chance one or both of these deals will sell out, so definitely hurry and grab one!</p>
      <h3>Roborock E35</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Efficient and Intelligent: Clean fast, with no random bumping. Using a dual-gyro system together with motion tracking sensors, cleaning is carried out logically and efficiently in every room. Thirteen types of sensors combine to offer cliff sensing, collision avoidance, mid-clean charging, and minimize the likelihood of entrapment.</li>
        <li>Large battery capacity: A large 5200mAh battery offers 2.5hours of non-stop cleaning. A generous dustbin means even big homes can be cleaned in one go.</li>
        <li>Thorough cleaning: 2000Pa of intense suction pulls dirt easily off hard floors, and drags it from deep inside carpet fibers.</li>
        <li>Vacuum and mop: Vacuum and mop simultaneously for sparklingly clean floors. The mop sucks in water evenly as it cleans, so it cleans without leaving puddles.</li>
        <li>App control: use the Mi Home APP to start, stop, schedule, customize, charge, check accessory status, control movement direction and more. A 2.4GHz Wi-Fi network is required.</li>
      </ul>
