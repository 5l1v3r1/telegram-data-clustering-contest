      <p><b>MEXICO CITY —</b> Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs took advantage of an error-strewn Los Angeles Chargers display to claim a 24-17 victory in Mexico City on Monday.<br/><br/>Mahomes overcame a sluggish start and a slippery surface at the Azteca Stadium as the Chiefs maintained their place atop the AFC West at 7-4.<br/><br/>The Chargers, meanwhile, were left ruing another uneven display from veteran quarterback Philip Rivers, who threw four interceptions after tossing three picks in his previous outing.<br/><br/>The 37-year-old's night ended on a miserable note as the Chargers chased a game-tying touchdown in the dying seconds.<br/><br/>After marching the Chargers upfield on a 77-yard drive inside the final two minutes, Rivers lofted a pass deep into the end zone intended for running back Austin Ekeler with 18 seconds left.<br/><br/>Chiefs safety Daniel Sorensen read the play however and darted in to snatch the interception, sealing victory for Andy Reid's side.<br/><br/>Rivers slumped to the turf in despair as the Chargers digested their seventh defeat of the season – all of them coming by margins of one score or less.<br/><br/>Rivers finished with 353 passing yards from 28 completions – almost double the 182 yards accumulated by opposite number Mahomes.<br/><br/>However, while it was far from a vintage display from reigning NFL MVP Mahomes, the Chiefs quarterback converted crucial scoring opportunities when they arose.<br/><br/>Mahomes finished the first half with just 63 passing yards against Rivers' 237, yet somehow had managed to shepherd the Chiefs into a 10-9 half-time lead in front of 76,000 fans.<br/><br/>Although much had been made beforehand of Mahomes long-range passing ability in the thin air of Mexico City, the Chiefs quarterback surprisingly excelled with the ball in hand. Mahomes rushed for 59 yards from five carries.<br/><br/>The decisive period came early in the third quarter, when Mahomes led the Chiefs on a nine-play 75-yard drive which culminated in a six-yard run from Darrel Williams for the touchdown to put Kansas City 17-9 ahead.<br/><br/>Mahomes then found tight end Travis Kelce with a 23-yard pass for the Chiefs' third touchdown and a 24-9 lead.<br/><br/>The Chargers rallied with Rivers finding Keenan Allen with a seven-yard pass for a touchdown, followed by a successful two-point conversion.<br/><br/>But the Chargers' hopes of a comeback ended with Rivers fourth interception of the game on the final drive. — AFP</p>
