      <p>Nov. 19 (UPI) -- Celine Dion said on <i>Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen</i> that she originally wasn't interested in singing her signature song "My Heart Will Go On" from the <i>Titanic</i> soundtrack.</p>
      <p>"It didn't appeal to me. I was probably very tired that day," <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=conBmLdtUEw">Dion said</a> Monday about why she at first rejected the song.</p>
      <p>The singer revisited the track and recorded a demo for it following advice from her late husband and former manager Rene Angelil.</p>
      <p>"I sang the song once and they build the orchestra around it. I never re-sang it for the recording," she continued about creating the hit song.</p>
      <p>"So the demo is the actual recording, but after that, I've sang it about three gazillion times," Dion said.</p>
      <p>Dion was asked by a fan on the show about her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zosJxbl2aY">love life</a> following Angelil's death and if she is currently dating anyone.</p>
      <p>"I don't date. I don't have a boyfriend and you know it doesn't mean that I will not find someone in my life. If I do that would be great, if I don't that would be great because I'm still in love," the 51-year-old said.</p>
      <p>"I've been living all my life with Renee. He's still within me. I see him through the eyes of my children everyday," she continued.</p>
