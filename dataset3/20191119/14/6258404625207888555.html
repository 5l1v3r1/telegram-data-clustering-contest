      <p>NVIDIA has already unleashed a "SUPER" refresh of its GeForce Turing family of desktop graphics processors across RTX and <a href="https://hothardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-gtx-1660-super-turing-review">GTX product ranges</a>. However, according to a new leak, NVIDIA is looking to extend the SUPER loving to its mobility GPUs in the opening months of 2020.</p>
      <p>AMD announced its <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/amd-radeon-rx-5500-rx-5500m-navi">Navi-based Radeon RX 5500M</a> GPUs for notebooks back in early October, and it's expected that there will be RX 5700M and RX 5300M offerings flanking it. To counter the threat from AMD, <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/nvidia">NVIDIA</a>'s SUPER refresh on the mobility side is expected to keep it in the driver's seat with respect to performance.</p>

      <p>Inside information on this new GPU lineup comes from <i>NotebookCheck</i>, which indicates that there will be five SKUs available to its OEM partners:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>N18E-G3R -- NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080M SUPER (8GB of GDDR6)</li>
        <li>N18E-G2R -- NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070M SUPER (8GB of GDDR6)</li>
        <li>N18E-G1R -- NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060M SUPER (8GB of GDDR6)</li>
        <li>N18P-G62 -- NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660M SUPER (4GB of GDDR6)</li>
        <li>N18P-G61 -- NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650M SUPER (4GB of GDDR6)            </li>
      </ul>
      <p>According to the leaked specs, all of the GPUs will feature GDDR6 memory along with slightly enhanced clock speeds compared to their "standard" counterparts and will ship by March 2020.</p>

      <p><a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/amd">AMD</a> is expected to have an upper hand with respect to pricing, and potentially with power efficiency with its 7nm <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/navi">Navi</a> mobile processors, so this move was no doubt expected from NVIDIA. The first notebooks with the <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/radeon-rx-5500m">Radeon RX 5500M</a> started shipping late last month, but we don't have any idea at the moment when its RX 5700M and RX 5300M counterparts will start shipping.</p>
      <p>As for NVIDIA, it's quite possible that we may see the company talk about these new mobile GPUs at CES 2020, which is fast approaching in early January.</p>
