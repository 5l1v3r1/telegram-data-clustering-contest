      <p>We're guessing there were tantrums in the Cambridge household as <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/prince-william/">Prince William</a> and his wife Kate headed out for a date night last night.</p>
      <p>The couple enjoyed some time off from parenting duties and headed to the London Palladium to watch the Royal Variety Performance in London.</p>
      <p>William and Kate left their three children – Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis – at home for the night with their nanny.</p>
