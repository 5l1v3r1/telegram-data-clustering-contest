      <p>Luh Kel broke out this year with the success of his single, "Wrong." It made serious waves, eventually landing on Billboard's Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart earlier this year. The single received a Gold certification from the RIAA but that was solely the success of a song. Without a full project underneath his belt, people have been wondering what he's capable of. Over the weekend, he unleashed his debut project, <i>Mixed Emotions. </i>Strapped up with twelve songs in total, the St. Louis native showcased his potential to be the next breakout R&amp;B star. Luh Kel holds down the entirety of the project on his own but he does enlist some help from <a href="http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/pnb-rock/profile">PnB Rock</a>, Jay Gwuapo, and IV Jay.</p>
