      <p>The Enugu State Police Command, Tuesday, paraded a self-acclaimed pastor, Sunday Egbo over his alleged involvement in the rape of a female member of his Church.</p>
      <p>He was paraded by the Enugu State Commissioner of Police, Ahmad Abdur-Rahman, alongside 36 other suspects by the Enugu State Police Command.</p>
      <p>Samuel is the General Overseer and founder of Christ Mercy Ministry, Ajuonu, Obukpa, Nsukka Local Government Area of Enugu State.</p>
      <p>The alleged rape led to his arrest and subsequent recovery of a small coffin, multiple female pants and braziers from his house.</p>
      <p>It was gathered that the victim, name withheld, had gone for prayers, during which the pastor had forceful carnal knowledge of her, after keeping her for several hours.</p>

      <p>The Police Commissioner said Samuel returned “at about 2300 hrs and dragged her to his room, brought out a magic stone and threatened to kill her if she raises alarm.”</p>
      <p>He further stated that after the rape, “he seized her pant; brazier and brought small bottle and wanted to insert it into her private part. She struggled and ran out naked.”</p>
      <p>Speaking to journalists, the pastor said that he procurred the coffin and other items from a native doctor in Kogi State, with the hope of making money and attracting favour.</p>
      <p>While admitting to raping the female member, the pastor said.</p>

      <p>“I wanted to have sex with her but she refused. So, I raped her.</p>
      <p>“I paid the native doctor N200,000, to get the coffin and the flute. He told me to do certain things, after which I will get a Ghana-Must-Go bag full of money in my room.</p>
      <p>“But after two weeks, the money did not come as the native doctor told me.”</p>
      <p>He left advice for Nigerians and other men of God.</p>
      <p>“I believe I was deceived. So, I’m advising other men of God to follow the ways of God. There is no need seeking power and favour from wrong ways.</p>
      <p>“I also advice Christians to be mindful of the places they go for prayers,” he said.</p>
      <p>Also paraded was an Inspector of Police, Maaling Peter of Rijana Police Station, Kaduna State, and two others for alleged kidnapping.</p>
      <p>The CP assured residents of the Coal City State of adequate security, with a warning on all criminals to turn a new leaf or leave the State.</p>
