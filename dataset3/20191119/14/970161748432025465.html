      <p>A ‘healthy’ foal has been found dead with a giant hole in its stomach – sparking fears that a big cat could be the culprit.</p>
      <p>The four-month-old horse was discovered lying on its side in a field in Greenhithe, Kent, last week on November 10.</p>
      <p>He was last seen alive the day before and had been in good health, his owner said.</p>
      <p>Rik Snook, formerly of Big <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/cats-movie/">Cats</a> of Britain, has now said he believes the horse was probably killed and eaten by a big cat, due to a series of sightings in the county.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘It is definitely possible a big cat is responsible. There have been reported sightings in the area.</p>

      <p>‘It is pretty common a big cat would want to go after a young horse. It would be the upper size of what the cat would go after, but it’s definitely not unusual.’</p>

      <p>The RSPCA was alerted to the piebald foal’s death, and said they could find ‘no obvious signs of ill health’.</p>
      <p>Inspector Kirsten Ormerod said: ‘From what I could see [he] looked in good body condition.</p>
      <p>‘It’s possible he died from natural causes and then was unfortunately scavenged on but his owner is understandably concerned so we are appealing for anyone with information to come forward.</p>
      <p>‘We urge anyone with information to contact our appeals line in complete confidence.’</p>

      <p>Britain only has one wild member of the cat family – but it bears more resemblance to a domestic tabby cat and can only be found in Scotland.</p>
      <p>However, there have been several ‘sightings’ of pumas and panthers over the years.</p>
      <p>In April, a cat the ‘size of an Alsatian’ was spotted in Cornwall, while a couple said their dog was injured by a large feline in Rutland, East Midlands, last month.</p>
      <p>Kent has had a fair share of big cat sightings, with four instances this year alone.</p>
