      <p>Gareth Thomas has <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/14/celebrity-big-brothers-gareth-thomas-reveals-living-hiv-trolls-threatened-expose-secret-10744616/">opened up about being diagnosed with HIV</a>, explaining he has taken the ‘power’ over his condition.</p>
      <p>The former rugby player told the world of his diagnosis back in September, sharing a video on his Twitter account explaining a tabloid newspaper had found out about his status and revealed the news to his parents.</p>
      <p>And, during an appearance on Loose Women, the 45-year-old explained that he is hoping to educate everyone else in a bid to end the stigma.</p>

      <p>‘When I was told that my parents knew I had HIV, and I hadn’t had the opportunity to tell them… I love my parents more than anything and I didn’t want to worry them, I didn’t want them to think I was going to die like I thought,’ he told the panel.</p>
      <p>‘I had to try and calm them all down, I had to try and get them to understand what living with HIV was. And at that point, I learnt to live with it but I hadn’t learnt to accept it myself.</p>
      <p>‘It was a struggle for me to expect someone else to accept it when I was struggling to accept it myself.</p>
      <p>‘I had to take control, and by taking control, I had to take the power. To have power, you have to have knowledge,’ he continued. ‘I did my own research. I spoke to other people who were living with HIV, I spoke to my doctors, I listened to my doctors.</p>

      <p>‘I realised that, through having all this knowledge, I’m okay with it.’</p>
      <p>The athlete <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/31/gareth-thomas-admits-wants-prove-hiv-not-frail-weak-11016255/">revealed that he is living with HIV in a video on social media</a>, shared back in September.</p>
      <p>In the clip, he explained: ‘Now you have that information, that makes me extremely vulnerable but it does not make me weak.</p>
      <p>‘Even though I have been forced to tell you this, I choose to fight to educate and break the stigma around this subject.’</p>

      <p>Now that Gareth has come to terms with the news, he is doing whatever he can to educate everyone else on the truth about his condition.</p>

      <p>‘Now what I have to do is educate everybody else, so everybody else will be okay with it. Not for me, this is bigger than me – HIV, the stigma, education, it’s bigger than me,’ he explained on the ITV show.</p>
      <p>‘I wanted to create environments where people wouldn’t be stigmatised, and by doing that, you have to educate people.</p>
      <p>‘It’s really easy to educate people, but it’s really hard to re-educate people. To try and get people to unthink these thoughts and plant new ones is really, really difficult.</p>
      <p>‘It’s impacted my life in a way that has made me so powerful. I am stripped bare. I have nothing to hide which is actually quite a free feeling, it’s really nice. It’s really, really nice.’</p>
