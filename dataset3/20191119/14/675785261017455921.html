      <h1>Edinson Cavani opens up on Lionel Messi spat after 'offering to fight' Argentina star</h1>
      <h2>Edinson Cavani and Lionel Messi argued and almost fought during Uruguay's friendly international draw with Argentina on Monday night</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T14:06:03+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 14:06</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Smith</a></address>
      <p>Edinson Cavani has shrugged off his spat with Argentina superstar Lionel Messi by claiming it was "part of South American football".</p>
      <p>Uruguay international Cavani offered to fight Messi during his country's friendly against the Argentines in Israel on Monday night.</p>
      <p>Messi is reported to have replied "whenever you want" to the challenge as a scuffle broke out after the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> legend was on the receiving end of a tough tackle.</p>
      <p>Luiz Suarez, Messi's Barca teammate, split up the duo as they continued to bicker in the tunnel.</p>

      <p>Diego Godin also tried to act as a peacemaker as he put his arm around Messi to try and bring a sense of calm to the situation.</p>
      <p>Despite it being an ugly moment in a 2-2 draw - which saw Messi, Cavani, Suarez and Sergio Aguero all get on the scoreboard - the Paris Saint-Germain ace insisted it was part of a fractious match.</p>
      <p>Cavani told <a href="https://www.tycsports.com/futbol-de-argentina/fuerte-cruce-entre-messi-y-cavani-en-el-primer-tiempo-20191118.html">TyC Sports</a> : "It's part of football, Clasicos are like this.</p>
      <p>"The truth is that it was at times a game that had friction, there were challenges and things that are part of football, especially of South American [football].</p>

      <p>"We take positives from our performance and the fact that we were able to score two goals. We still need to improve but it's good to end the year like this."</p>
      <p>To go alongside the attack from Cavani, Messi has been forced to swallow a hard truth from Brazil manager Tite - that he isn't as good as Pele.</p>
      <p>"Pele is incomparable. Anybody who wants to compare Pele to any other athlete...do you know what I do? I hear but I don't listen.</p>
      <p>"It's as if this person doesn't know the history of this man's quality...this guy was phenomenal. Once I said that Messi is extraordinary.</p>
      <p>"I meant he's extraordinary to the present time and among humans, with his creativity. Pele is out of normal patterns, and I'm not saying this because I'm a Brazilian. You can't find a defect.</p>
      <p>"If somebody comes to me and starts to make comparisons, for me it has no credibility."</p>
