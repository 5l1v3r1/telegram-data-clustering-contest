        <b>Thanks to Randy Andy for giving us something to talk about apart from Brexit, albeit at the expense of making himself the most unpopular royal.</b>

      <p>A YouGov poll puts RA bottom of the Royal class for popularity.</p>

      <p>When asked if they have a positive of negative opinion of 15 royals, Prince Andrew came out at the bottom with a net favourability of -19 percent (19 percent positive minus 38 percent negative).</p>
      <p>Funnily enough, people with personal experience of meeting His Royal Randiness have widely varying accounts of what he’s like – from boorish to well-briefed, businesslike and charming.</p>
      <p>Mind you the sort of occasions when people I know have met HRR have been when he’s been on duty and therefore supposed to be putting on a show.</p>
      <p>It’s a different matter meeting a guy with his trousers down.</p>
