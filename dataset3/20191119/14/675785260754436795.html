      <p>Babies and mothers died amid major failings at a hospital trust in what is likely to be the NHS's worst ever maternity scandal, it was revealed today.</p>
      <p>A leaked report shows that a "toxic" culture stretching back 40 years was in place when babies and mothers suffered avoidable death.</p>
      <p>Children were also left with permanent disability amid substandard care at Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust.</p>
      <p>Staff at the trust routinely dismissed parents' concerns, were unkind, got dead babies' names wrong and, in one instance, referred to a baby who died as "it".</p>
      <p>In another case, parents were not told their baby's body had arrived back from the post-mortem examination, and it was left to decompose so badly that the family never got to say a final goodbye.</p>
      <p>The interim update report, which has been obtained by The Independent, comes from an independent inquiry ordered by the Government in July 2017.</p>
