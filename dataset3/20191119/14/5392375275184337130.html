      <p>While the Korean firm – Samsung experienced some glitches that delayed the timely rollout of the <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/19/galaxy-fold-samsung-explains-how-it-camhttps://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/19/galaxy-fold-samsung-explains-how-it-came-to-this-design/e-to-this-design/">Galaxy Fold</a>, the Korean giant eventually rolled out the device a while ago and is now back with<a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/18/samsung-galaxy-w20-5g-white-color-exposed/"> a second and, perhaps, a better offering</a>. Welcome the  Samsung W20 5G – Samsung’s latest, and second foldable smartphone.</p>
      <p>The firm following a series of leaks, and rumors today at an <a href="http://news.mydrivers.com/1/658/658071.htm">event</a> in China took the wrap off the Samsung W20 5G, and as speculated, the de device shares a lot with the Galaxy Fold, although note a completely rebadged Fold. The design revolves around that of the Fold, with an articulated spine, or the <i>hinge</i>, that allows it to open and close like a book.</p>

      <p>And much like the Galaxy Fold the Samsung W20 features two screens – a secondary, and an outer display when in the folded state, and a primary, and a larger one that becomes visible when unfolded. The device flaunts a 7.3-inch tablet-sized display with a  1,536 x 2,152 pixels and support for HDR10+, while there is a smaller  4.6-inches display with HD+ resolution on the outside.</p>
