      <h1>ESPN Computer’s Picks For Week 13’s Biggest Games</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T14:26:21+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 14:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Just two weeks remain in the 2019 college football regular season. The second-to-last full Saturday of the year is coming this weekend.</p>
      <p>Week 13 will be highlighted by Ohio State’s game against Penn State. It will serve as a de facto Big Ten Championship play-in game (and, likely, a College Football Playoff elimination contest).</p>
      <p>ESPN’s Football Power Index has made its pick for the game between the Buckeyes and the Nittany Lions, along with the rest of Week 13’s biggest games.</p>
      <h3>No. 2 Ohio State vs. No. 9 Penn State</h3>
      <p>Winner: Ohio State, 84.3 percent</p>
