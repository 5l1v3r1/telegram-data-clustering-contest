        <b>If you're a fan of Stanley Kubrick's cult classic The Shining, Doctor Sleep is a must-watch.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Director Mikey Flanagan gets it spot on despite the various challenges of such a project.</p>
      <p>First, there's the difficulty in adapting a Stephen King novel.</p>
      <p>His work is so prolific that countless books have been adopted for film or TV, normally they're terrible or excellent.</p>
      <p>We felt Doctor Sleep fell into the later category.</p>
      <p>Flanagan also had the challenge of doing justice to Kubrick's classic film.</p>
      <p>He did it perfectly, paying tribute to the original and its characters at the right time while also making sure Doctor Sleep had its own identity.</p>
      <p>It follows a grown-up Danny Torrence (Ewan McGregor) as he reluctantly returns to his 'Shine' powers to mentor a young girl named Abra (Kyleigh Curran) who has even stronger telepathic abilities than his own.</p>
      <p>The old ghouls and monsters from The Shining rear their ugly heads once again but Flanagan resists the urge to be too indulgent with these established characters.</p>
      <p>Instead, they simply supplement the new evil haunting the protagonists, a sinister cult called the True Knot.</p>
      <p>The True Knot are led by the a brilliant, but terrifying, character called Rose the Hat.</p>

      <p>An excellent performance from Rebecca Ferguson brings Rose's character to life.</p>
      <p>And...... *slight spoiler alert if you prefer going into a film completely blind*... the return of the Overlook Hotel tops it off!</p>
      <p>So often contemporary sequels to classics fail to get it right but that's not the case with Doctor Sleep.</p>
      <p>Despite it's poor intake at the box office so far, it's well worth a watch and we give it four stars.</p>
