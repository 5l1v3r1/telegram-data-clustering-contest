      <h1>2020 Audi S8 with a massive 800Nm debuts internationally</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T14:03:38+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 14:03</time> by <a rel="author">Team OD  </a></address>
      <p>Audi has taken the wraps off the more driver-focussed iteration of its Audi A8 flagship sedan. The Audi S8 is the quickest A8 available and unlike other new S models, is available with a petrol motor. This makes it a viable option for India's line-up in India, given that the new generation A8 L is set to debut here in some time.</p>

      <p>The petrol motor in question is the twin-turbo 4.0-litre V8 with mild-hybrid tech. It makes 578PS and a massive 800Nm. Audi claims this will get the 2,230kg car from 0 to 100kmph in 3.8s and let it go on to a limited 250kmph top speed. The 48-volt belt alternator starter and the additional lithium-ion battery enable coasting with the engine switched off, fast restart and an extended start-stop range. The company claims that this system can conserve up to 0.8 litres of fuel for every 100km driven.</p>

      <p>There's a lot of suspension tech now available as standard to reign in the S8's pace. The most notable of these is the predictive active suspension. It uses the car's cameras to predict changes in the road surface and lift or push each wheel down separately via a system of electromechanical actuators. This works in conjunction with the air suspension system, also helping to control pitch and roll. Further, this system also leans the S8 into corners to allow for a more consistent experience. The degree of this lean changes according to the selected drive mode, in which a new Comfort+ setting has been added. Further, an all-wheel steering system which has been added improves stability on the highway and makes the S8 more agile at slower speeds. Finally, a new sport differential actively manages the torque between the rear wheels for spirited driving to stabilise the car. Buyers can also specify a carbon-ceramic brake option.</p>

      <p>There are small stylistic changes both inside and out. New details have been added to the front bumper, side sills and the exterior mirror housings. This is paired with the S-specific twin oval exhausts. Wheel sizes up to 21 inches are optionable. A black styling package is also available that replaces all the chrome bits with gloss black. Nine design packages are available for the interior, with a Carbon Vector inlay available only on the S8. Other interior highlights are the dynamically bolstering sport seats, the leather upholstery, the unique s-themed graphics for the Virtual Cockpit instrumentation and a full suite of assistance systems.</p>

      <p>Prices of the Audi S8 should start around the Rs 1.75 crore mark if Audi India decides to bring it here.</p>
