        <b>Fine Gael by-election candidate Verona Murphy has been criticised for comments she made about asylum seekers.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Murphy, who is standing in the Wexford by-election for Fine Gael, has apologised for the comments.</p>
      <p>She previously linked asylum seekers to ISIS and said they needed to be "deprogrammed".</p>
      <p>Murphy's comments have been highlighted for critics after she visited a Direct Provision centre in her constituency.</p>
      <p>Labour leader Brendan Howlin accused Murphy of making a cynical move, adding that she could not be "rehabilitated" by visiting asylum seekers.</p>
      <p>It is unacceptable and it does real damage to the integration process," he said.</p>
      <p>"Using the most vulnerable people who are in a place of safety as a sort of a shield to rehabilitate a candidate for a political purpose that's just not acceptable."</p>
      <p>James Brown, the sitting Fianna Fáil TD for Wexford, accused Murphy of targeting vulnerable asylum seekers to distract from the Government's poor record with homelessness, health and other issues.</p>
      <p>He said: "She's clearly campaigning on this issue of immigration now she's raised it on these three different interviews and what she's trying to do is distract from the lack of services and lack of delivery for Wexford and instead is targeting a vulnerable group in our society.</p>
      <p>"Her comments are absolutely outrageous, they are totally wrong and the vast majority people in Wexford do not agree with them."</p>
      <p>Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said he has spoken to Murphy about her comments on immigrations, adding that her remarks were "wrong, misinformed and ill-advised".</p>
