      <p>Alan Irvine has held talks with Heart of Midlothian regarding their managerial vacancy.</p>
      <p>The former West Bromwich Albion head coach, who was appointed as Pepe Mel’s successor but who was sacked shortly after Christmas in 2014, is being tipped to replace the departed Craig Levein with Hearts struggling down in ninth place in the SPL table.</p>
      <p>Sky Sports reports that Irvine has discussed the role with the club after they were given a recommendation by striker Stephen Naismith, who worked with Irvine at both Everton and Norwich City.</p>

      <p>It’s believed that Irvine is also under consideration for the Jam Tarts’ vacant sporting director role, which they’re equally keen to fill as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>Neil Warnock, who has just left Cardiff City, Neil McCann, Stuart McCall and Paul Ince are among those in the running with the bookies.</p>
      <p>   </p>
      <p>Irvine, now 61, has held either jobs as an assistant or caretaker at Blackburn, Norwich and West Ham since leaving The Hawthorns and has worked under the likes of compatriots David Moyes and Paul Lambert in that time.</p>
      <p>The former Preston manager was brought in as Albion’s head coach in the summer of 2014 and, despite a promising start and victories over Tottenham Hotspur and Aston Villa, he was sacked after the defeat at Stoke City which left Albion in 16th and sending an SOS to Tony Pulis.</p>
