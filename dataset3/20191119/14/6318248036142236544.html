      <p>Four witnesses are scheduled to testify before the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday, Nov. 19, in what will be the third day of public impeachment hearings. Jennifer Williams, an aide to Vice President Mike Pence, and Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a U.S. Army officer who works on the National Security Council, will testify in the morning session. In the afternoon, Kurt Volker, the former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine, and Tim Morrison, the former senior director of European affairs at the National Security Council, will appear. The hearings are part of the impeachment probe into President Donald Trump's conduct, sparked by a whistleblower complaint. The whistleblower raised concerns about a July phone call in which Trump requested Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky investigate former vice president and 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son.</p>
