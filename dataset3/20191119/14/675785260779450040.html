      <h1>Love Island Christmas reunion 'cancelled' as stars accuse ITV of ignoring them</h1>
      <h2>The Love Island Christmas special has been axed this year - as ITV bosses gear up for the new winter series taking place in January</h2>

      <p>This year's Love Island Christmas reunion won't be going ahead as ITV bosses have quietly axed the one-off special.</p>
      <p>Every year since Caroline Flack brought back the series in 2015 has seen the stars of the summer show get together again for a special December episode.</p>
      <p>The reunion shows are usually full of drama as warring exes who have been slating each other over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/instagram">Instagram</a> set eyes on each other for the first time since leaving Majorca.</p>
      <p>But this year the cast of Love Island 2019 won't get their highly anticipated reunion - amid claims ITV producers have been ignoring them.</p>

      <p>"The cast don't think there are any plans for a Christmas reunion like last year, but they haven't been given a straight answer," an insider told <a href="https://www.ok.co.uk/tv/reality/love-island-christmas-special-reunion-20914334">OK! Online</a> .</p>
      <p>"A few of the islanders have seen the producers since leaving the villa and there was a bit of a reunion at the ITV Palooza last week and the topic was brought up but quickly shut down.</p>
      <p>"Questions were asked about the possibility of an on-screen reunion, but they were all ignored by producers."</p>
      <p>Ouch.</p>

      <p>With a brand new winter version of the show on the horizon, it's no wonder ITV would want to focus on the upcoming cast, who will be filming in South Africa with Cazza for a series airing in January.</p>
      <p>Next year, for the first time, two editions of Love Island will air, and the winter cast has already been picked.</p>
      <p>While an official date hasn't been confirmed, the show's reportedly set for a comeback very soon into the new year - on January 8, 2020.</p>
      <p>According to  <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-7600847/Love-Islands-debut-winter-series-start-date-revealed-airs-two-weeks-summer-season.html">MailOnline</a> , those who work on the show will be jetting out on New Year's Day.</p>

      <p>Insiders told the publication: "The new Winter Love Island will launch the second week of January.</p>
      <p>"Bosses are still deciding on the final date but it is thought to be 8th January - a week after staff arrive in South Africa."</p>
      <p>The sources added that two weeks will be trimmed off the summer edition's run time - meaning it would run for six rather than eight weeks.</p>
      <p>"It has been decided that the show will run six weeks instead of the usual eight," they said.</p>
      <p>"The new cast of singletons fly out just days before the launch but bosses work with test Islanders to uncover the best spots in the villa to create drama."</p>
