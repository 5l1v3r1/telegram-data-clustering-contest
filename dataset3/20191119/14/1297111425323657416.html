      <h1>Mandryk: Sask. Party gov't must remove politics from trade offices and trips</h1>
      <h2>Trade junkets and offices have always been framed as political, and Harper's presence will likely not alleviate the political accusations.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T14:53:14+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 14:53</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://leaderpost.com/author/mmandryk" target="_blank">Murray Mandryk</a></address>
      <p>About the only thing more politically perilous for the Saskatchewan Party government than its reimagined interest in foreign trade offices is its growing interest in ministerial foreign travel.</p>
      <p>That said, there are also valid reasons for both: We are dependent on trade, and anything that contributes to better trade and fewer barriers is likely money well spent.</p>
      <p>Forget the nonsense that the new <a href="https://leaderpost.com/news/local-news/no-partisan-appointments-to-new-saskatchewan-trade-offices-minister/wcm/c871d1d8-5c24-44d3-a9bf-ac634b753355">trade offices for Japan, India and Singapore </a>are about “asserting more provincial autonomy”, as suggested by Trade Minister Jeremy Harrison. Politics here is decidedly unhelpful, and Harrison’s gratuitous shots at Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s admittedly disastrous trip as the source of pulse crop trade problems is actually untrue.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/agriculture/how-tariffs-and-theyre-u-s-ones-are-already-hurting-one-canadian-company">Indian government first slapped a 30-per-cent tariff on chick pea and lentil imports in December 2017,</a> which was before <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/22/asia/extremist-scandal-trudeau-india-visit-intl/index.html">Trudeau’s trip to India in February 2018.</a> Trudeau’s visit likely didn’t help matters, but such measures always have more to do with domestic politics than international politics.</p>
      <p>“They’ve basically just stopped the (pulse) trade around the world,” Murad Al-Katib, president and CEO of Regina-based AGT Food and Ingredients, said in July, 2018. “They’re doing it to protect their domestic farmers and to increase local prices before next year’s elections.”</p>
      <p>As such, this might actually be a far better case to justify new trade offices … and maybe even trips like Harrison’s current adventure to India, in which he is accompanied by former Conservative prime minister Stephen Harper, whose consulting company has been been hired by the Sask. Party government under a one-year, $240,000 contract.</p>
      <p>“As dependent as we are on international trade, we need to be in these markets because we have seen things go the wrong way,” Harrison said Friday.</p>
      <p>It’s important to note that Saskatchewan has had a 70-year history with foreign offices — its first being the one in London set up by Tommy Douglas’s Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) government. Yes, they are expensive — $4.2 million to open the three additional trade offices, according to one government official, and $335,000 annually to run Saskatchewan’s only current trade office in Shanghai. Yes, their effectiveness has been questionable.</p>
      <p>However, trade is worth literally billions of dollars to the Saskatchewan economy. Harrison rightly noted Friday that exports to India alone have fallen to $650 million last year from about $2 billion in 2015.</p>
      <p>This clearly suggests the problem isn’t just Trudeau. The ceaseless politicking from the likes of Harrison at a time of heightened western alienation is bordering on dangerous. That said, it can also be argued that having a national figure like Harper who does know his way around foreign embassies and still carries weight is a very good thing — both when it comes to addressing a big current economic problem for Saskatchewan and even potential national unity questions that are coming down the road.</p>
      <p>The problem, however, is Saskatchewan trade junkets and offices have always been framed as political, and Harper’s presence will likely not alleviate the political accusations.</p>
      <p>For example, the Sask. Party has absolutely feasted off the past NDP government’s excessive travel bills, vowing to keep its ministerial travel costs below that of its predecessor. That has been increasingly more difficult under Premier Scott Moe and Harrison, who do love their foreign travel.</p>
      <p>Perhaps former premier Brad Wall learned from the NDP opposition of three decades ago, who beat up the former Progressive Conservative government for having <a href="https://twitter.com/MMandryk/status/1195453169351966721?s=20">five foreign trade offices — </a>largely manned by political operatives (former PC finance minister Bob Andrew in Minneapolis, former PC cabinet minister Paul Rousseau in London, former PC privatization minister Graham Taylor in Hong Kong, finance department bureaucrat Lawrie McFarlane in Zurich and trade bureaucrat Michael Cohen in New York. (New York was the last one, eventually closed by the Roy Romanow government in 1997.)</p>
      <p>Harrison vowed Friday that won’t happen again, and that these offices will be manned by professionals rather than those seeking political reward. Time will tell.</p>
      <p>The Sask. Party government will need to demonstrate that trade offices and travel are worth it.</p>
