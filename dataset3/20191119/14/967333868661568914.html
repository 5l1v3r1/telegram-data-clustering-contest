      <p>Through the app, users can add a badge to their profile highlighting their planned festival destination. From there, they have the ability to match and chat with other users attending the same event before they arrive.</p>

After festivals including EDC Las Vegas, Bonnaroo, British Summer Time and EDC, Orlando, Festival Mode will have its debut in India with the Bacardi NH7 Weekender in Pune.</p>
      <blockquote>“We are constantly working towards making the<a href="https://sputniknews.com/science/201909061076732009-tinder-watch-out-facebook-launches-a-new-dating-app-in-the-us/"> Tinder experience</a> more intentional and seeking ways for users to not only find matches with like-minded interests but also to showcase themselves in a more purposeful manner,” says Taru Kapoor, General Manager, Tinder and Match Group.</blockquote>
      <p>“We know our diverse community values connecting over shared interests, and with Festival Mode we are introducing an innovative new way for Tinder users to make IRL connections.”</p>
      <p>“Tinder is a reflection of its community, and as our members seek new, varied experiences, we are excited to be there to enable more meaningful connections,” Kapoor adds.</p>
      <p>According to a Google report, dating searches are catching up with matrimony queries, with a 40 percent increase in the former over the past year. The dating app market is expected to be worth $100 million in the next five to eight years.</p>
