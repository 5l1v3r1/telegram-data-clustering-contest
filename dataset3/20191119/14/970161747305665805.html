      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/caroline-flack/">Caroline Flack</a> has touched down in Cape Town as filming for Winter <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/love-island/">Love Island</a> officially begins.</p>
      <p>The host of the series was seen teasing some behind the scenes clips of her photos shoots – as well as the outfits she’s going to wear as the series starts.</p>
      <p>Caroline couldn’t resist a cheeky selfie or two as she settled into the glamorous life of South Africa, posing in a fancy hotel next to a bar.</p>
      <p>She then jokingly appeared to be napping in the next shot, confirming she was there for Love Island with the caption: ‘Love Islanded out.’</p>

      <p>Another snap at dinner, posted on her Instagram stories, declared she’d had the ‘longest day ever’.</p>
      <p>While it’s yet to be made official, rumour has it the series will kick off on 8 January, barely time for you to put your Christmas decorations away before we settle in for a long, hot…winter?</p>
      <p>Just doesn’t sound the same, does it? A well-hot winter? We’ll think on it.</p>

      <p>In the meantime, Caroline has been enjoying the sights and headed to Boulders Beach to check out the penguin colony there.</p>
      <p>(And for a few more shots for the ‘Gram because why wouldn’t you make the most of it?!)</p>
      <p>Speaking about her upcoming travels to South Africa, Caroline admitted to Metro.co.uk <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/13/caroline-flack-dreading-juggling-winter-love-island-in-south-africa-and-uk-aftersun-as-filming-kicks-off-this-weekend-11091430/">she was ‘dreading’ the hellish commute</a> to and from the villa.</p>

      <p>While the main show is filmed in South Africa, and she will drop into the brand new villa with her usual ‘Flack Attacks’ to stir the pot for the love matches, Caroline will also have to be in the UK every week for Aftersun.</p>

      <p>‘It’s a long old flight just to do that walking,’ she laughed. ‘It’s a 13 hour flight! I’ve got to go back and forth the whole time to do Aftersun over here.’</p>
      <p>But obviously she’s making the most of it, and added: ‘I’m really excited to get a winter holiday, because I hate being cold, so it’s come at the right time for me.’</p>
