      <h1>Amazon's Fire TV Blaster Lets You Hook Up Your Fire TV and Echo for Better Voice Control</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T14:00:16+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author">Tom Pritchard</a></address>
      <p>Amazon's current range of Fire TV devices has had Alexa built in for a while, though only the Fire TV Cube will function as a proper Echo-like device with hands-free control over your TV. The other Fire TV device still require pressing a button on the Alexa Voice Remote. Well soon there will be a device that changes that, letting you connect your existing Echo devices to a Fire TV for better hands-free control over what you watch.</p>
      <p>The new device is called the Fire TV Blaster, and it's an IR device that will connect your devices together to let you use them in tandem with one another. That way you can use Alexa voice commands to control your Fire TV without having to keep the remote handy all the time. Of course you also need to be an existing Echo user, otherwise the Fire TV Blaster will be totally useless.</p>

      <p>Amazon says it believes that voice is one of the most natural ways to control your TV and that it helps eliminate the need more multiple remotes. That last point relies on having compatible TV equipment, though I'm not convinced of the claim voice is more natural. I've use the voice-centric Fire TV Cube, and I found that voice can't fully replace the remote. But maybe that's just me.</p>
      <p>The Fire TV Blaster will be available from 11th December for the price of £35, and will be compatible with the Fire TV Stick, the Fire TV Stick 4K, and the third generation Fire TV (that's the square dongle). It'll also be available in a bundle that includes the Fire TV 4k and an Echo Dot for £86.98 - which is £47.99 less than it would cost to buy them all separately.</p>
      <p>Pre-orders are open now,<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/firetvblaster"> over on the Amazon website.</a></p>
