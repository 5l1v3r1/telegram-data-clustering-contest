        <b>The government has urged people not to get confused by misleading information over salt stock and rising prices.</b>
      </p>
      <p>“It appears that a vested quarter is spreading rumours to make windfall profits by manipulating salt prices. People are requested not to get confused,” the Ministry of Industries said in a statement on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>A mobile court sentenced four Habiganj businessmen on Monday night for trying to stockpile salt by spreading rumours.</p>
      <p>The ministry published a notice in the wake of rumours about rising salt prices in different districts outside Habiganj.</p>
      <p>“The demand for edible salt per month is around 100,000 tonnes. On the other hand, we have a salt reserve of 600,000 tonnes. So there is no question of a salt crisis.”</p>
      <p>Besides, sufficient quantity of salt is available in the reserves of various salt company dealers, wholesalers and retailers across the country, it said.</p>
      <p>“The salt production season has also started.”</p>
      <p>Bangladesh Small &amp; Cottage Industries Corporation, or BSCIC, has opened a control room at its headquarters to take salt-related queries on 02-9573505 and 01715223949.</p>
