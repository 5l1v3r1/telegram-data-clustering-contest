      <h1>Rangers have made this Alfredo Morelos decision amid Aston Villa transfer interest</h1>
      <h2>Aston Villa transfer news | All eyes are on January now when the transfer window re-opens and Dean Smith will have a chance to strengthen his side in the New Year</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T14:47:12+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 14:47</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Cusack</a></address>
      <p>Alfredo Morelos is on a shortlist of January targets for French side Saint-Etienne, according to reports in France.</p>
      <p>And Rangers will not sanction a January departure of <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/alfredo-morelos">Morelos</a> , who will only let the Colombian international leave for a big-money fee.</p>
      <p>French website <a href="https://www.leprogres.fr/sport/2019/11/19/le-colombien-alfredo-morelos-sur-les-tablettes-de-l-asse">LeProgres</a> report that Claude Puel's side have sent scouts to watch Morelos, with the Rangers star also linked with the Ligue 1 boss' old club, Leicester City.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/aston-villa-fc">Villa</a> have been heavily linked with a move for the 23-year-old, who scored a 93rd minute winner for Colombia in a friendly against Peru on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Â </p>
      <p>Morelos has been in fine form this season and that goal was his 23rd of the season - nine of those coming for Steven Gerrard's Rangers.</p>
      <p>Predictably, Gerrard and new sporting director Ross Wilson <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/alfredo-morelos-rangers-transfer-news-17251523">have issued a firm 'not for sale' message</a> to Villa and other potential suitors.</p>
      <p>Morelos has 70 goals in 117 appearances for Rangers and has also turned out for HJK Helsinki and Independiente Medellin over the course of his career to date.</p>
