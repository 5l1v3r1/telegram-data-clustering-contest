      <p>TWO LIMERICK HURLERS were sent home from their trip to New York and disciplinary proceedings have commenced against them, Limerick GAA have confirmed.  </p>
      <p>An altercation between one of John Kiely’s players and another man on the New York streets over the weekend was allegedly filmed by a fellow Limerick panellist which was widely circulated on social media. </p>
      <p>The 2018 All-Ireland champions were Stateside for the Super 11s tournament where they lost to Kilkenny by 24 points in the final.</p>
      <p>It’s understood the two players in question were sent home by Kiely on Sunday, 24 hours before most of the rest of the group flew back to Ireland. </p>
      <p>A statement issued by Limerick GAA this afternoon read:</p>
      <p>“Limerick GAA can confirm that it sent home two panellists early from last weekend’s New York Hurling Classic following an incident.</p>
      <p>“Limerick expects the highest of standards of behaviour and example from its players both on and off the field and will not tolerate any breach of those standards.</p>
      <p>“A disciplinary process has commenced and there will be no further comment in relation to this matter.”</p>
