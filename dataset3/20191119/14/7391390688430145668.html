      <p>Remember when you were younger, and you'd tear open a holiday gift, only to find it was a gift card or even worse, <i>money</i>? You'd take a deep breath, and force a smile so hard it hurt until you could find what you really came for: new toys. But somewhere along the path to adulthood, when you began to understand just how useful cash actually is, your holiday gifts probably started to get a lot more practical and, well, incredibly boring. <a href="https://www.bustle.com/most-wanted-holiday-2018-tech">Holiday tech gifts</a><b> </b>are where all that changes. Sure, socks are warm and kitchenware is sometimes necessary, but home assistants, laptop-tablet hybrids, and smart watches are our one chance to have new gadgets to play with around the holidays again. (And because it's 2019, there's a good chance they can talk to you, too.)</p>
      <p>The best part about tech gifts is that you truly don't have to be a techie to give or receive them, because they're all about making areas of our lives easier, whether it's by motivating our workout or streamlining our marathon-watching session.</p>
      <p>To help narrow down the endless possibilities of technology out there, here are the best 2019 holiday tech picks based on products that came out this year.</p>
      <h3>Apple Watch Series 5</h3>

      </p>
      <p>With its new always-on display and features that can track your menstrual cycle, alert you if your environment is too loud, and give you a long-term look at your activity patterns, the newest Apple Watch is a dream device for the person in your life who’s both health conscious and constantly on the go. Oh, and it tells the time, too.</p>
      <h3>Google Nest Hub Max</h3>

      </p>
      <p>Multitasking at home just got way easier, thanks to the Google Nest Hub Max. The smart display with a 10-inch HD screen makes it easy (and perfectly normal) to video call mom while you’re folding laundry, turn off the lights in your bathroom when you’re in the kitchen, or play a “how to make quinoa" YouTube video seconds after the quinoa has been poured into the pot.</p>
      <h3>Ring Fit Adventure For Nintendo Switch</h3>

      </p>
      <p>You don’t have to be a hardcore gamer or gym-goer to enjoy this fantasy game-turned-exercise — all you need is a sense of adventure. Use the Leg Strap and Ring Con equipment (which mimic your actual motions in the game) to defeat a dragon, and get some movement in all at once.</p>
      <h3>Amazon Fire TV Cube</h3>
