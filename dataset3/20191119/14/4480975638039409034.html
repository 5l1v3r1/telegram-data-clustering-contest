      <h1>Fed's Williams: Monetary policy is now well-positioned</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T14:13:24+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 14:13</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/eren-%C5%9Fengezer" target="_blank">Eren Sengezer</a></address>
      <p>Commenting on the Federal Reserve's <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar">monetary policy</a> actions, "This year's interest rate cuts have been very effective," said John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and noted that the policy is now well-positioned.</p>
      <p>"The US economy is in a very good place," Williams stated. "The <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/macroeconomics/central-banks/fed">Fed</a> is very close to achieving the 2% inflation goal on a sustained basis."</p>
      <p>These comments had little to no effect on the USD's market valuation. As of writing, the US Dollar Index was virtually unchanged on the day at 97.80.</p>
