      <p>OTTUMWA — The Ottumwa Police Department is seeking information that would lead to the arrest of wanted person, Jason Andrew Tobeck, 41, of Ottumwa.</p>
      <p>Tobeck currently has six arrest warrants: Parole Violation (Original charge Prohibited Acts; Possession with intent more than five grams of Methamphetamine), Three warrants for Failure to Appear for Initial Appearance on Driving While Revoked and Driving While Suspended, Driving While Suspended and Interference with Official Acts.</p>
      <p>Police say Tobeck is considered to be armed and dangerous, has violent tendencies and is known to abuse drugs. Tobeck has been allowed to operate vehicles belonging to his associates. Officers have attempted to stop Tobeck in these vehicles, and he fled from police at high rates of speed causing a significant risk to the public. People who assist Tobeck by allowing him to utilize a vehicle registered in their name can be criminally charged and civilly liable if Tobeck injures someone while driving the vehicle.</p>
      <p>Any person found to be harboring Tobeck inside of their residence could also be arrested and charged with being an “Accessory After the Fact.”</p>
      <p>If anyone has information on Tobeck’s whereabouts, they are requested to contact the Ottumwa Police Department at (641) 683-0661 or their local law enforcement agency.</p>
