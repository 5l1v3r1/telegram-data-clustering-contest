      <h1>Leonardo DiCaprio's Instagram post on Delhi pollution</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T14:39:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 14:39</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.deccanherald.com/author/dh-web-desk" target="_blank">DH Web Desk</a></address>
      <p>Hollywood star Leonardo DiCaprio has expressed concern over the rising levels of pollution in Delhi through a post on Instagram. The post gives details about the recent protest which was held in New Delhi by climate activist groups like Extinction Rebellion India, LetMeBreathe, Fridays For Future India and others.</p>

      <p>There were around 1500 people gathered in front of the India gate to demand immediate action on Delhi’s hazardous pollution levels. According to the post, people of all age groups joined the demonstration which led to “ direct action for Indian citizen”.</p>
      <p>The situation in Delhi has worsened as there is very poor visibility in some areas. Delhi and its suburbs were under a cloud of thick smog after Diwali last month. The air quality index was in the "severe" category for several days, prompting the government to close schools and advisories being issued asking people to stay indoors.</p>
      <p>Despite many promises, "the air is still unsafe and activists will keep the pressure on until the air pollution reaches safe levels''. </p>
