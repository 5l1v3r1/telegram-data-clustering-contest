      <h3>8. The Law Allows Us To Intercept: Indian Government</h3>
      <p>India’s government said on Tuesday it’s “empowered” to intercept, monitor and decrypt digital information in the public interest as long as its agencies follow the law.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Laws allowed federal and state governments to intercept “any information generated, transmitted, received or stored in any computer resource,” the Minister of State for Home Affairs G. Kishan Reddy told Parliament in a written reply when asked by an opposition lawmaker whether the government had snooped on WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Viber, and Google calls and messages.</li>
        <li>Information can only be intercepted by “authorised agencies as per due process of law, and subject to safeguards as provided in the rules,” the statement said.</li>

      <h3>10. Disney And Amazon: The Best Of Frenemies</h3>
      <p>When Walt Disney Co. launched its new streaming service last week, it had a key partner: Amazon.com Inc.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Many consumers connected to Disney+ through the tech giant’s Fire TV digital media players.</li>
        <li>And Amazon Web Services helped deliver Disney’s movies and TV shows to viewers through its cloud-computing network.</li>
        <li>But Amazon is also Disney’s streaming competitor -- one of many so-called frenemies in the burgeoning market for online TV.</li>
        <li>Media and tech companies have forged uneasy alliances as they cope with one of the biggest shifts in the history of entertainment.</li>
        <li>Delivering shows and movies to consumers online has required a new level of teamwork between Hollywood and Silicon Valley, and it doesn’t always go smoothly.</li>
