      <p>KIRKSVILLE, Mo. â€” For one Heartland community, hunting season has almost the same economic impact as holiday season.</p>
      <p>Deer firearms season brings both economic and community enrichment to the City of Kirksville.</p>
      <p>Hotels around Kirksville were completely booked during the first weekend of deer firearms season. Restaurants, businesses and even the airport saw a big economic boost from opening weekend as hunters flocked to northeast Missouri to harvest the biggest buck.</p>
      <p>Kirksville Tourism Director Debi Boughton spoke with KTVO to give us more insight on how hunting season has impacted the City of Kirksville in the last year and in the present year.</p>
      <blockquote>"The people that come to town also eat in our restaurants and they shop in grocery stores while they're here. My husband and I were out to dinner Saturday night and right at our next table were a group of deer hunters. So they are really spending money in our community and that helps all the businesses and the city government itself," Boughton said."</blockquote>
      <p>Boughton couldn't give specific numbers about how this past weekend impacted Kirksville economically, but by having every hotel booked, and restaurants and other businesses seeing an influx of hunters, she tells KTVO that she expected the weekend to be very positive for the city's economy.</p>
