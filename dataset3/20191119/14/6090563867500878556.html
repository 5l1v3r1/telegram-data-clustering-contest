      <h3>Zimbabwe have handed Chipolopolo a painfull defeat at the National Heroes Stadium. Kaizer Chiefs poster boy Khama Billiat scored a brace for the Warriors while RedBull Salzburg striker Patson Daka scored a mouth watering goal for the hosts</h3>
      <p>Zimbabwe Warriors are back on the road to Cameroon 2021 Africa Cup of Nations after winning 2-1 away at Zambia Chipolopolo’a home turf. Following a painful draw against the Zebras of Botswana, Zimbabwe were quick to settle with a well taken header by Khama Billiat  after 10 minutes following a dangerous corner kick by captain Knowledge Musona.</p>
      <p>The hosts then equalised in 18 minutes after the recalled under 23 striker Patson Daka outpaced Zimbabwe defence before firing a rocket past Elvis Chipezeze’s near side. Zambia then tried to seal victory with quick counters and ferocious raids from the flanks but the visitors’ backline was now fully alert thwarting everything thrown at them.</p>
      <p>Chipezeze also played a part to ensure there was not going to be another goal.</p>
      <p>With their eyes on goal, the Zambians’ lapse of concentration at the rear allowed Musona, the silent assasin, to sneak into the 18 area unnoticed before threading a loose ball to an unmarked Khama Billiat who punished the hosts with a well taken goal after 79 minutes.</p>
      <p>Warriors coach Joey Antipas then introduced Patson Jaure for Musona and Butho Ncube for Nakamba to kill the Zambian momentum before the final whistle.</p>
