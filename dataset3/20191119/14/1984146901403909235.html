      <p>Nissan has been named as the North East’s largest company for the eighth year in a row at the annual unveiling of The Journal Top 200.</p>
      <p>Hays Travel and the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/go-ahead-group">Go-Ahead Group</a> were also among the winners as the annual list, which ranks the region’s largest companies by turnover, was revealed in an event at Newcastle’s <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/st-james-park">St James’ Park.</a></p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/nissan">Nissan’s</a> revenues of £6.26bn meant it stayed at the top of the Top 200 list, followed by <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland">Sunderland</a> transport group Arriva and Newcastle’s Go-Ahead Group.</p>
      <p>The automotive giants also took the prize for being top company in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/county-durham">Durham</a>, Sunderland and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/south-tyneside">South Tyneside</a>, while Go-Ahead Group was top company in Northumberland and Tyneside. Vehicle firm Northgate plc, which is based in Darlington, took the award for top company on Teesside.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere at the awards, Sunderland’s Hays Travel was named the top privately-owned business, while Parkdean Resorts was the top private equity backed business.</p>
      <p>The highest climber in this year’s list was <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/gateshead">Gateshead’s</a> Bloom Procurement, which rose 64 places from last year’s table with a turnover of £94.4m. The highest percentage increase in turnover, meanwhile, was Lynemouth Power and the highest new entry was Stockton’s Mandale Homes.</p>

      <p>The event was introduced by Helen Dalby, senior editor and head of digital at Reach plc in the North East.</p>
      <p>She said: “It has never been more important, amid the uncertainty of <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/brexit">Brexit</a> and the impending General Election, to recognise and champion the businesses making a difference to our regional economy.</p>
      <p>“Whether they are climbers, new entries or private businesses, these wealth creators all have one thing in common - the huge contribution they make to the prosperity and well-being of the North East.</p>
      <p>“That contribution extends far beyond the confines of turnover or profit numbers and into our very fabric as a region.</p>
      <p>“Many of these firms support large supply chains, community, charity and cultural projects and, of course, offer employment to thousands of local people.</p>
      <p>“This has been a year in which our region has once again shone in the national and international spotlight, with events ranging from the European Rugby Finals here at St James’ Park, to the World Transplant Games and the stunning spectacle that was last week’s Lumiere festival in Durham.</p>
      <p>“Time and again we show that the North East business community remains robust and highly competitive in global markets.</p>
      <p>“The Journal and The Gazette have always stood shoulder to shoulder with our business community. The Gazette recently celebrated its 150th year of telling the stories of Teesside’s people and businesses, while The Journal has been banging the drum for enterprise in the North East since 1832.</p>
      <p>“We will always be committed to saluting your achievements, and we are proud to support your ambitions.”</p>
      <p>The event was sponsored by <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">Newcastle United</a>, PwC, Sodexho, Hays Travel, Newcastle College and Blair West.</p>
