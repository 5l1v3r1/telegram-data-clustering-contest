      <h1>Crisis on Infinite Earths Photo Officially Debuts Smallville's Tom Welling</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T14:11:34+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 14:11</time> by <a rel="author">Jon Arvedon</a></address>
      <p>As "<a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/crisis-on-infinite-earths/">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a>" looms on the horizon, The CW has debuted the first official photo of <i>Smallville</i> star Tom Welling's Clark Kent from the upcoming Arrowverse crossover.</p>
      <p>The photo, which comes from the <i>Batwoman </i>episode of the crossover ("Crisis on Infinite Earths: Part Two"), features Welling sporting a flannel shirt and work gloves while clutching a small hatchet, presumably working on the Kent farm.</p>

      <p>It was in September that we first <a href="https://www.cbr.com/smallville-tom-welling-joins-crisis-on-infinite-earths/">learned Welling</a> would reprise his <i>Smallville</i> role for "Crisis." However, in November, it was reported that the character would only be featured in <a href="https://www.cbr.com/report-tom-welling-crisis-on-infinite-earths-only-one-scene/">one scene</a> during the crossover, so if that holds true, this photo could be a fairly good indicator as to what we'll see Welling doing when the "Crisis" arrives.</p>
      <p>"Crisis on Infinite Earths" begins Sunday, Dec. 8 and 8 p.m. ET/PT on <i>Supergirl</i>, then continues in <i>Batwoman</i> on Monday, Dec. p at 8 p.m. ET/PT and in <i>The Flash</i> on Tuesday, Dec, 10 at 8 p.m. ET/PT. After the winter hiatus, the crossover will conclude on Tuesday, Jan. 14 in <i>Arrow</i> at 8 p.m. ET/PT and in <i>DC's Legends of Tomorrow</i> at 9 p.m. ET/PT.</p>
