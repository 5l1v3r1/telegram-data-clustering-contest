      <p>Instead, when updates are available, they’re installed automatically.</p>
      <p>You can, however, check the firmware version of your <a href="http://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/196318/614286/10014?subId1=bitht_111819_update-airpods&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case-latest-model-white%2F6083595.p%3FskuId%3D6083595">AirPods</a> – in other words, what their current update version is – whenever you like.</p>

      <h3>When AirPods update automatically</h3>
      <p>You can’t force your <a href="http://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/196318/614286/10014?subId1=bitht_111819_update-airpods&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case-latest-model-white%2F6083595.p%3FskuId%3D6083595">AirPods</a> to install an update, but it’s helpful to know when they’ll perform the update automatically.</p>
      <p>Your AirPods will update when:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The AirPods are in their charging case.</li>
        <li>The AirPod case is charging – either plugged into a charging cable or on a wireless charging pad (if they can charge wirelessly).</li>
        <li>The AirPod case is near your <a href="http://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/196318/614286/10014?subId1=bitht_111819_update-airpods&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-iphone-11-with-64gb-memory-cell-phone-unlocked-black%2F6223303.p%3FskuId%3D6223303">iPhone</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>How to check your AirPods’ firmware version</h3>
      <p><b>1.</b> Place the AirPods in their charging case.</p>
      <p><b>2.</b> On the iPhone, start the Settings app.</p>
