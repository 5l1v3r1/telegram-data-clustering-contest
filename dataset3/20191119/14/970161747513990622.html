      <p>Doctors are warning about ‘feather duvet lung’ after a man developed a sudden and severe reaction to his bedding.</p>
      <p>Martin Taylor was left breathless, tired and unable to work within just a few months.</p>
      <p>He had been previously healthy and initially doctors had no idea what was causing his symptoms.</p>
      <p>The Scottish man had suddenly started to experience dizzy spells in late 2016 and he went to his doctor in November of that year.</p>
      <p>But two months later, the 43-year-old still didn’t have a diagnosis – and he was getting much worse.</p>
      <p>He wasn’t able to stand for more than a few minutes and he was so breathless, it took him 30 minutes to climb the stairs as he needed to sit down and rest every few steps.</p>
      <p>He was referred to Dr Owen Dempsey, an expert in respiratory medicine at Victoria Hospital, Kirkcaldy and Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>There, he was diagnosed with hypersensitivity pneumonitis – a severe allergic reaction in the lungs.</p>
      <p>Tests showed that he was reacting to dust from bird feathers but the patient did not have any contact with birds and his only pets were a cat and a dog.</p>
      <p>It was only on further investigation that they realised the cause might be his new duvet – he had switched from synthetic bedding to feather bedding just before his symptoms started.</p>
      <p>He was prescribed steroids and switched his bedding and found that his breathing improved.</p>
      <p>After 12 months, he was able to stop the steroids and now he says: ‘My oxygen saturation level nowadays is regularly 97%–98% which I understand to be normal for someone my age, and I have not had any dizzy turns since recovering.</p>
      <p>‘It doesn’t affect me at all now and my life is pretty much as it was before.’</p>
      <p>The condition was named ‘feather duvet lung’ and the doctors who treated him are warning medical professionals to be on the lookout for the condition.</p>
      <p><a href="https://casereports.bmj.com/content/12/11/e231237.full">Writing in a study published in the BMJ</a>, they said that it’s important to ask about bedding if a patient has unexplained breathlessness as recognising the condition quickly could prevent irreversible scarring in the lung.</p>
      <p>If you have changed your duvet and find that you aren’t reacting well, speak to your doctor and consider switching to another type.</p>
