      <p>Predictably, Ghana’s young millionaire (not the fake Shatta Bandle tho…LOL!) Ibrah One, real name Ibrahim Dauda could not wait for the foregoing brouhaha between Kelvynboy and Stonebwoy to wane before sharing his two cents about it.</p>
      <p>Recall that Stonebwoy during his performance at the 2019 4Syte TV Music Video Awards paused and advised  up &amp; coming artists to show respect to mainstream artists who are helping them.</p>
      <p>The message as we all know, was nicely packaged as a diss to his former signee, Kelvynboy.</p>
      <p>He said: “<b>Big up to Samini, my godfather, and the upcoming wey dem no dey respect, dem for sit well.”</b></p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.ghbase.com/stonebwoy-subtly-throws-new-shots-at-kelvynboy-during-his-performance-at-the-2019-4syte-music-video-awards/">Kelvynboy could not keep mute as he shot back</a></b> at him, saying some people (Stonebwoy) always want to be good in the eyes of others; painting others black forgetting they’re black people too.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.ghbase.com/shatta-wale-joins-stonebwoy-to-diss-kelvynboy-full-gist-here/">Shatta Wale, who seems to agree with what Stonebwoy</a></b> tweeted also joined the fray with his own comment. He wrote: <b>They never know re – writable CD and Diskette before that be why Dem deh disrespect <a href="https://twitter.com/stonebwoyb">@Stonebwoy.</a></b></p>
      <p>It is against this background that the popular Ghanaian young millionaire posted on SnapChat that the action of the two Dancehall greats is rather pushing Kelvynboy’s brand.</p>
      <p>According to him, Stonebwoy and Shatta Wale are not shading Kelvynboy as their motive suggests but they are rather shooting him to a higher heights for free.</p>
      <p><b>“Stonebwoy and Shatta Wale may think they are shading Kelvynbwoy. But theyre rather shooting him up to higher heights for free,”</b> he wrote.</p>
