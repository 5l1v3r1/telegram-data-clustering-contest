      <h1>Makola-Sirino Incidents’ Are Chalk &amp; Cheese – Reader’s Voice</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T14:31:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 14:31</time> by <a rel="author">Shakes lamola</a></address>
      <p>The PSL DC has drastically sentenced Cape Town City midfield maestro, Mpho Makola, to a six months suspension amid the star footballer’s assault to match official Abongile Tom.</p>
      <p>The independent league body has all the powers vested in them to discipline players and the Makola incident is no different. The question remains, Is Makola the only culprit or are there others who were let go despite committing similar offences?</p>
      <p>The answer to the question should be simple. Plenty of our stars got lesser sentences in the past. But rules are rules and Makola had to face the music.</p>
      <p>Mamelodi Sundowns fan favourite, Gaston Sirino, appeared before the DC for slapping Clayton Daniels on the face and head. But this is far from what Makola did to Tom.</p>
      <p>Players retaliate almost in every match and should Sirino be heavily punished, then soon every team will have two players to play. Makola assaulted a match official, Tom chickened out, Makola should have got his marching orders right there on the spot.</p>
      <p>Rules are rules and shouldn't be changed just for an individual. Sirino should have been red carded but not a six month’s suspension. Law 12 of the FIFA statutes deal with the Sirino matter clearly. Makola-Sirino incidents are chalk and cheese, we can't compare the two.</p>
      <p>We shouldn't be emotional when dealing with the rules. Sirino must be punished for his actions but not like Makola. The lid is sealed and the can isn't leaking so don't open another can of worms.</p>
