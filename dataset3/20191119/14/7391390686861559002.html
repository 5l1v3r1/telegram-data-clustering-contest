      <p>Supermarkets are notorious for using a lot of single-use plastic. In fact, Greenpeace predicts that supermarkets contribute around a whopping <a href="https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/news/supermarket-plastic-reduction/">59 billion pieces of single-use plastic</a> each year. But now the UK (and the environment) could be getting an early Christmas present. Some major supermarkets are taking plastic pollution seriously as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/black-plastic-banned-supermarkets-christmas-11173816/">Sainsbury’s, Tesco, Waitrose, and ASDA are banning black plastic</a> in the products they stock.</p>
      <p>Morrison’s set the pace by banning black plastic last week. According to consumer magazine The Grocer, Morrison’s say this new move accounts for almost <a href="https://www.thegrocer.co.uk/plastic/morrisons-eliminates-black-plastic-from-all-own-label-food-and-drink/599341.article">4,000 tonnes of plastic being made more easily recyclable</a>. Black plastics, often found as packaging for products like biscuits, ready meals, and meats are used because they are cheap and can be made with <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/50461271">low value multi-coloured waste plastic</a> the BBC says.</p>
      <p>Tesco is said to be removing all black plastic by the end of December and Waitrose have “<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/black-plastic-banned-supermarkets-christmas-11173816/">removed nearly 90%</a> of the 2,291 tonnes of black plastic it uses as of the end of October,” <i>Metro</i> reports. According to <i>Evening Standard</i>, a spokesperson for ASDA said: “<a href="https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/at-least-five-supermarkets-on-track-to-ditch-black-plastic-by-end-of-year-a4290536.html">By the end of next year</a> nearly a third of our plastic packaging will be from recycled sources and all of our packaging will be 100% recyclable by 2025." And Sainsbury’s have also said they would have a ban on black plastic <a href="https://www.about.sainsburys.co.uk/news/latest-news/2019/13-09-2019-sainsburys-to-halve-plastic-packaging-by-2025">by the end of December</a>.</p>

      <p><i>Metro</i> reports that Iceland, Marks &amp; Spencer, Aldi, and Co-Op all also plan to reduce their single-use black plastic next year.</p>
      <p>So what’s the issue with black plastic anyway? Well, it’s a bit of a recycling nightmare. According to yoghurt company The Collective, who recently changed their black yoghurt lids for environmental reasons, <a href="https://www.thecollectivedairy.com/collaboration/going-greener/">black plastic contains carbon pigment to give it it’s black colour.</a> But this pigment isn’t always detected by infrared sensors in recycling plants, meaning it’s usually sent to landfill or incineration rather than properly recycled. And Greenpeace says creating a new recycling system with the ability to sort between black plastics and other plastics would <a href="https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/news/blackplastic/">“take a lot of time and money.”</a></p>
      <p>Right now, we are in a plastic pollution crisis. Already in some parts of the world, <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/plastic-outnumbers-fish-7-to-1-in-some-parts-of-the-ocean-new-research-shows-19347578">plastic is outnumbering fish 7 to 1 in their aquatic habitats</a>. National Geographic estimates that <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.co.uk/environment-and-conservation/2018/05/fast-facts-about-plastic-pollution">40% of plastic produced</a> is made into packaging that is used just once and then thrown away. Clearly, there's never been a more important time to act.</p>
