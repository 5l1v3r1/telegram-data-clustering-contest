    <meta property="og:description" content="Retirement village and aged care company Arvida has benefited from strong gains in the value of property and improved sales prices. The company's net profit rose 47 percent to $45 million in the six months ended September, lifted by gains in property values, and higher revenue from treatment and hospital fees. The bottom line was also boosted by the three villages bought from the Sanderson Group for $180m, which have now been largely integrated. Revenue rose 5 percent, to $79.6m, reflecting increased sales and resales prices. Arvida's chief executive Bill McDonald said the rest of the financial year was expected to remain strong with high demand for units."/>
