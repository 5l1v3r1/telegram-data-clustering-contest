      <p>There are a lot of smart security cameras on the market, some well-known and some not quite so. With security cameras, we’ve found that it’s generally better to stick to popular brands like Hive, Logitech, D-Link, Ring and Netatmo. That’s down not only to better protection against hackers but the quality of the connected apps – something that we think is important as the camera itself.</p>
      <p>That does mean you’ll often be paying a premium for smart security cameras, but we’re confident that it’s worth spending the extra bit of money to get a quality product that won’t let you down when you need it most.</p>
      <p>In terms of features, most smart security cameras offer night-vision, two-way talk via a smartphone app and a wide-angle POV, but some go further than that. Some offer waterproofing and long battery life for outdoor use, built-in sirens and a few even feature built-in AI to identify people it captures.</p>
      <p>It’s worth mentioning that even with a discount on the initial purchase, you’ll likely be paying a monthly fee to access cloud recording capabilities and maybe even some of the advanced features of the camera – it all depends on the manufacturer.</p>
      <p>If you want any more information about the range of smart security cameras on the market, we’d recommend taking a look at our selection of the <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/test-centre/digital-home/best-security-cameras-3631664/">best smart security cameras</a>.</p>
      <h3>Where to find smart security camera deals</h3>
      <p>You’ll find security cameras in most electronics retailers, along with anywhere else that sells tech in-store or online.</p>
      <p>When it comes to deals, <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/?ascsubtag=06-3778148-11-0000000">Amazon</a> generally has some of the best deals – especially as we get closer to <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/feature/internet/black-friday-2019-3661756/">Black Friday 2019</a> later this month. Some of the best deals are Lightning Deals, which run for a few hours and often offer only limited stock, so they tend to sell out quickly.</p>
      <p>If you find you’re always a little too late, we’d recommend signing up for Amazon’s <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/prime/pipeline/signup?ascsubtag=06-3778148-11-0000000">30-day free trial of Prime</a>, providing early access to Lightning deals along with all other benefits of the membership.</p>
