      <h3>Can we get rid of the touchpad now please?</h3>
      <p>A <a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/ps5/">Sony PS5</a> controller patent has been discovered and doesn’t stray too far from the familiar; in fact, it looks like a PS4 controller without its lightbar.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.j-platpat.inpit.go.jp/?uri=/d0200">The patent</a>, first discovered by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-details-ps5-controller/">VGC</a>, shows a controller that’s almost identical to the DualShock 4 apart from the removal of the lightbar. Judging by the design, the DualShock 5’s triggers are slightly larger and the device seems to have two headphone jacks for some reason.</p>
      <p>Sony has planned to increase the PS5 controller’s battery life, so extra space for a larger battery and the absense of a power-sucking lightbar seems to be a two-hit punch. Now all we’d like to see is the removal of the touchpad — does anyone even use it?</p>
      <p>We’ll have more on the <a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/ps5/">PS5 and its controller</a> as it’s made available.</p>
