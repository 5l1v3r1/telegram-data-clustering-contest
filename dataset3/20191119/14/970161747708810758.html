      <p>The last thing you’re probably thinking about right now is family days out during the Easter and Summer holidays.</p>
      <p>You might still be a little excited to hear, however, that Nickelodeon are planning to bring an activity extravaganza to our shores over Easter next year – and there will be loads to do.</p>
      <p>Nickelodeon’s Big Base Camp will be the first of its kind in London – an immersive experience based around all the greats of the channel.</p>
      <p>Visitors will be able to meet characters from the likes of Paw Patrol and Spongebob Squarepants, as well as different activities for all ages of kids (or adults).</p>
      <p>The 10-day event – at a new London venue called Magazine – will run from Saturday 4 April to Monday 13 April 2020, and will be split into two sections.</p>

      <p>The Camp Studio Experience is one of these parts, and is specifically designed for kids aged 7 to 14. For this part, you’ll drop your little ones off, and they’ll be guided round the experience by a Nickelodeon Ambassador.</p>

      <p>This will include a whole host of challenges you’ll have to complete as a team. Expect escape rooms, green screens, and a whole load of slime.</p>

      <p>The second part is Bikini Bottom, where everyone from toddlers to grandparents can hang out and get a piece of the action.</p>
      <p>Here, there’ll be a main stage with entertainment, as well as a ball pit and craft area. You can even order food from The Krusty Krab or one of the themed street food vans.</p>

      <p>The Experience tickets are £28 plus a booking fee, and adult and junior tickets (without the Camp Studio Experience) are £14.25 plus booking fee.</p>
      <p>No adult or junior tickets can be purchased without the purchase of at least one Experience ticket, and each Experience ticket allows you to buy one adult ticket and one junior. It’s all a bit confusing, but people don’t seem to mind as they’re already selling out some time slots.</p>
      <p><a href="https://bookings.kaboodle.co.uk/book/9782/ticket">You can get your tickets here</a>.</p>
      <p>However, if you don’t manage to get your hands on some, you could head down to your local The Works and see if <a href="https://www.theworks.co.uk/p/home-decorations/nickelodeon-slime-advent-calendar/5056219033716">they have any of these brilliant Nickelodeon slime advent calendars</a>.</p>
