      <p>BALTIMORE — A <a href="https://www.wmar2news.com/weather/over-400-meteors-per-hour-expected-thursday-night">meteor shower</a> is set to occur Thursday night into early Friday morning, with over 400 meteors per hour — but it's unclear if the shower will be a quick burst of shooting stars for the ages or a bust with just a few meager meteors gliding through the skies above.</p>
      <p>The meteor shower is known as the Alpha Monocerotids. The shower gets its name from the Monoceros constellation, which lies southwest of the constellation Orion in the southeast sky.</p>
      <p>On Thursday night, the shower will occur right above the horizon in the east to the southeast sky.</p>
      <p>Up to 400 meters can be seen within a matter of 30 minutes, according to scientists at <a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap980810.html">NASA's Ames Research Center.</a></p>
      <p>As in years past, this show is unique in the sense of its uncertainty in regards to peak viewing. In 1995, an outburst of shooting stars led to a magnificent show — but year to year, it's never clear how many meteors will be visible.</p>
      <p>Telescope or a good pair of binoculars are needed to get the best view of the shower. Viewers will want to get out around a half an hour before the peak — around 11:15 p.m. ET to 11:20 p.m. ET, since peak sits somewhere around 11:50 p.m. ET.</p>
      <p>For the best view, try to get away from bright city lights and find a spot that is a bit elevated.</p>
