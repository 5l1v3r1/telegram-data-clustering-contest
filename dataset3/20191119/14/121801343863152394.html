      <p>Nickelodeon has renewed preschool series <i>Blues Clues &amp; You</i> for a second season.</p>
      <p>The pickup for the updated version of 1990s series <i>Blue's Clues</i> follows a strong showing in the ratings for its first few episodes. The Viacom-owned cable network has ordered 20 more episodes of the show, equaling the number of installments for its first season.</p>
      <p><i>Blue's Clues &amp; You</i> features human host Josh (<a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/blues-clues-sets-new-host-title-1142732">Josh Dela Cruz</a>) and animated puppy Blue as they search for clues to solve a puzzle in each episode. Blue leaves her paw print on the clues, encouraging the show's target audience of young kids to play along and interact with what's on screen.</p>
      <p>The series premiered Nov. 11 and drew solid ratings for its first week, averaging 647,000 total viewers, up 34 percent from the time-period average for the prior four weeks. More than a third of those viewers (257,000) come from the under-5 age group, the target audience for preschool programming. That was up 38 percent from the previous four weeks.</p>
      <p>Original <i>Blue's Clues</i> host Steve Burns (who was involved in choosing Dela Cruz to host the new series) also appears in <i>Blues Clues &amp; You</i> and will return in the second season. Donovan Patton and Carolyn Fe will also have roles in season two.</p>
      <p><i>Blue's Clues &amp; You</i> is part of a set of preschool shows on Nick that includes <i>PAW Patrol, Blaze and the Monster Machines, Abby Hatcher, Butterbean's Cafe, Peppa Pig, Nella the Princess Knight</i> and <i>Bubble Guppies</i>.</p>
