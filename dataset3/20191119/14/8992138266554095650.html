      <p><a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/executives/moves/coinbase-hires-new-vp-of-business-to-fill-emilie-chois-shoes/">Emilie Choi, COO of Coinbase</a>, said that “the team at Bison Trails shares our long-term vision of advancing the crypto ecosystem towards delivering massive utility at a global scale.

      <p>“We believe crypto networks will continue to move towards active network participation models (i.e., staking, voting, signaling, etc.), further reinforcing the need for solutions such as those that Bison Trails provides… Coinbase Ventures is happy to support mission-aligned founders like Bison Trails, as we collectively work towards expanding the crypto-economy.”</p>
      <p>Brad Stephens, Co-founder &amp; Managing Partner of Blockchain Capital, said of Bison Trails that “new protocols and next-generation crypto networks involve active participation by investors, end-users and partners.
