        <b>These are the emotionally charged Hollyoaks scenes tonight which see Ste Hay (Kieron Richardson) make the decision to take a step away from the village. His life was very nearly destroyed recently after he was groomed by a far right gang.</b>
      </p>
      <p>After realising the depravity of their racism, he found himself trapped in their world and it was only when <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/hollyoaks-spoilers-billy-price-promises-journey-for-sid-sumner-after-he-kills-dad-stuart-in-far-right-climax-11162990/">he narrowly avoided death at the hands of Stuart Sumner and Jonny Baxter</a> that he was able to find some closure. However, he has a great deal of healing still to do.</p>
      <p>He has been growing close to Azim over the last couple of weeks as it was Azim who helped Ste see the light and start to step away from the twisted values of Stuart’s group. However, Sami is concerned that Ste is not ready to commence a relationship so soon after all of the damage that has been done to him and byhim to others.</p>

      <p>He has a frank chat with him tonight and Ste comes to a decision and says his goodbyes – but fear not, this is not the last we will see of the character as Kieron has confirmed that he will be back in time for the show’s 25th anniversary celebrations.</p>

      <p>He said: ‘After nearly 14 years, it is time for Ste to hang up his tracksuits, just for a little bit. It makes sense for the story because Ste has got to go and find himself, sort himself out and find forgiveness in himself for the stuff that he’s done.’</p>

      <p>‘It just timed quite right that I was going to take a break from being so busy for the past 14 years. However now I am just as busy because I am taking part in a play which is called Band of Gold by Kay Mellor and it’s going on tour from November until March next year which is very super exciting.</p>

      <p>‘We are going in to 2020 at the end of the tour, and we are also going in to the 25th anniversary of Hollyoaks which is something I am adamant I am going to be a part of. I love the Hollyoaks fans, I love the entire cast, everybody at Hollyoaks, and I can’t wait to get back.’</p>
