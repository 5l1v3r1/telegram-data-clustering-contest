      <p>Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss made their first-ever acquisition, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-19/winklevoss-brothers-buy-a-startup-founded-by-identical-twins?cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_content=business">Bloomberg</a> reported Tuesday, and the entrepreneurs involved have more than their crypto interests in common.</p>
      <p>The Winklevii purchased Nifty Gateway, a business that allows user to buy "nifties" — digital collectibles tracked on a blockchain ledger — with a credit card. The company's founders, Duncan and Griffin Cock Foster, are also identical twins. </p>
      <p>"You can't make this stuff up," Tyler Winklevoss told Bloomberg. "There are so many great parallels, it was just the right fit."</p>
      <p>Nifties can range from an in-game item to a token representing a physical item like a painting or book. Such collectibles are typically purchased with digital-currency wallets, which require several steps and transfers to set up.</p>
      <p>The Winklevoss twins rose to fame for their role in <a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/fb-stock?utm_source=markets&amp;utm_medium=ingest">Facebook's</a> founding. They now run Gemini, a cryptocurrency exchange founded in 2015 that looks to bring government regulation and legitimacy to the volatile asset. </p>
      <p>The Winklevoss' Gemini Trust acquired Nifty for an undisclosed amount, and the two crypto-related ventures will continue to work separately from each other. The arrangement could change, and Nifty services could find their way onto Gemini's platform, according to Bloomberg.</p>
      <p>The Cock Foster's platform currently allows users to buy nifties from OpenSea marketplace and the CryptoKitties and Gods Unchained games, according to Bloomberg. Duncan Cock Foster projects nifties to reach 1 billion collectors in the future. The Winklevoss twins are similarly optimistic, telling Bloomberg the nifties industry will eventually dwarf the art, gaming, and collectibles markets. </p>
      <p>"All great companies, all great ideas there's a period where you see a truth and many other people don't, and you have to have that conviction," Tyler Winklevoss told Bloomberg.</p>
