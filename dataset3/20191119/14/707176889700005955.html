      <h2>Reduction in guidance raises concerns for stores as they head into holiday shopping season</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T14:31:47+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 14:31</time> by <a rel="author">Alistair Gray</a></address>
      <p>US retail stocks came under selling pressure on Tuesday after disappointing guidance from two of the sector’s biggest names, Kohl’s and Home Depot, raised worries over how stores are faring as they head into the holiday shopping season.</p>
      <p>Both companies — a bellwether department store chain and the nation’s largest DIY retailer, respectively — reduced financial forecasts for a second time this year.</p>
      <p>Shares in a dozen listed US retailers lost at least 4 per cent in the ensuing sell-off, led by an 18 per cent drop in Kohl’s. Its department store rivals Macy’s and Nordstrom fell 9 per cent and 7 per cent, respectively.</p>
      <p>Michelle Gass, Kohl’s chief executive, said the company had “experienced softness” in September, citing an “increasingly competitive environment” and unseasonably warm weather.</p>

      <p>The company, which operates 1,100 stores, underlined the persistent difficulties in the department store sector with like-for-like sales in the most recent quarter that ticked up only 0.4 per cent from a year ago.</p>
      <p>While this marked an improvement from a 2.9 per cent decline in the previous three months, analysts had forecast a more robust recovery, pencilling in a near 1 per cent rise. The Wisconsin-based company’s net income declined 28 per cent from a year ago to $116m.</p>
      <p>However, Mrs Gass said that Kohl’s was “positioned for a strong holiday season”, pointing to a national rollout of a scheme under which Amazon customers can return items bought online in Kohl’s stores, and new brand launches.</p>
      <p>The sector-wide sell-off came even though results from TJX, also released on Tuesday, provided evidence that some retailers are coping well with the rise of Amazon.</p>
      <p>The discounter, which operates TJ Maxx and Marshalls, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191119005581/en/TJX-Companies-Reports-Q3-FY20-Results-Guidance">reported</a> a stronger-than-forecast 4 per cent rise in like-for-like sales and lifted its earnings guidance for the full year.</p>

      <p>Home Depot, whose shares have been trading near record highs, also performed <a href="https://ir.homedepot.com/news-releases/2019/11-19-2019-110010761">far better</a> than other retailers in the third quarter. The group generated sales of $27.2bn in the period, a rise of 3.6 per cent from a year ago on a like-for-like basis.</p>
      <p>However, those results also fell short of forecasts. Craig Menear, chief executive, said an $11bn investment plan designed to better integrate Home Depot’s online and physical presence had yet to generate the expected improvements.</p>
      <p>“We are seeing benefits from the initiatives — it’s just not at the rate of our original plan,” he told analysts.</p>
      <p>Mr Menear blamed technology setbacks in particular. IT projects, including a new website for business contractors, had “proven to be more complex than originally anticipated”.</p>
      <p>Home Depot said it now expected full-year like-for-like sales to rise 3.5 per cent from last year, weaker than the 4 per cent previously forecast. Although third-quarter net earnings dipped from $2.9bn in the same period a year ago to $2.8bn, the company still expected annual diluted earnings per share to be up 3.1 per cent.</p>
      <p>Kohl’s said it now expected diluted earnings per share, adjusted for exceptional items, to come in at between $4.75 and $4.95 — a year-on-year decline of between 12 and 15 and per cent. That compares with previous guidance of between $5.15 and $5.45.</p>
      <p>TJX forecast annual diluted earnings per share to rise between 7 and 8 per cent from a year ago, to range of $2.61 to $2.63. Its shares rose 2.3 per cent.</p>
