        <b>The Green Party has launched its election manifesto with a pledge to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2030.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The party says it will create a "new green deal" to tackle climate change, investing £100 billion per year until 2030.</p>
      <p>The deal would mainly be paid for through borrowing.Within their manifesto, the party also pledged to increase NHS funding, hold a second Brexit referendum and give 16 and 17 year olds the vote.</p>
      <p>Launching the manifesto at an event in London, co-leader Jonathan Bartley said it was the "most ambitious green deal anywhere in the world."</p>
      <p>He continued: "This will put us back on track to decarbonise every single sector of the economy by 2030, while delivering social justice across Britain.</p>
      <p>"Our very planet is raising the alarm. Hitting snooze for another 15 years is simply not an option."</p>

      <p>The party will be standing in 498 out of 573 English and Welsh seats in the December election.</p>
      <p>The party is not standing in 50 seats to make way for Liberal Democrat and Plaid Cymru MPs as part of the "Unite to Remain" pact.In the last parliament, Brighton MP Caroline Lucas was party's only MP to be elected.</p>
      <p>However, in the European parliament they have seven MEPs.</p>
      <p>Greens co-leader Sian Berry said the party would push for its policy programme to be implemented with 10 new pieces of legislation.</p>
      <p>"Ten bills ready for the next Parliament to hit the ground running - because the future won't give us another chance to get these next two years right," she said.</p>
      <p>"The more Green MPs we have, the more chance we have to save the future."</p>
