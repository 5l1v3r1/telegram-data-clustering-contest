        <b>KISUMU, Kenya, Nov 19 – Kisumu Governor Anyang’ Nyong’o on Tuesday inaugurated a new County Executive Committee Member for Finance ending months of uncertainty following the delayed exit of Nerry Achar after he was impeached by the County Assembly in August.</b>
      </p>
      <p>George Okong pledged to address challenges facing the County Treasury including a ballooning wage bill that has shrank available resources for development and infrastructure modernization.</p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>He said the county government should take cue from the national government on how to deal with wage bill.</p>
      <p>“The wage bill is not an issue in budgeting but a policy matter that needs to be addressed by the county in the same manner as the national government,” he said.</p>
      <p>Okong said under his reign as the finance head, he will streamline the budgeting and planning process to be elaborate, timely and inclusive.</p>
      <p>The finance executive noted that the county had reviewed the current systems on revenue collection, and he is ready to ensure the new measures are put in place.</p>
      <p>“The key issue is assessment of the streams to determine highest potential, which is structured revenue rather than the unstructured streams, we have to invest in revenue collections,” he said.</p>
      <p>He noted that he will strive for a prudent expenditure and cash flow management where he will address matter of proper estimation of cash flow.</p>
      <p>“This will help us in eliminating pending bills and be able to comply with the Public Finance Management (PFM) procedures to minimize audit queries and debt management,” he said.</p>
      <p>Okong’o assured residents of Kisumu County that under his leadership he will ensure timely implementation of projects by the contractors who shall be awarded tenders.</p>
      <p>Governor Nyong’o who presided over the ceremony called for teamwork among his county executive members to ensure service deliver to the residents.</p>
