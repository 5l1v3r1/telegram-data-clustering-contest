      <h1>Wales' cheapest home is a derelict stone cottage that's for sale for just £25k</h1>
      <h2>There's already been an offer on it, so you have just days left to stand a chance of securing it</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T14:08:13+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 14:08</time> by <a rel="author">Joanne Ridout</a></address>
      <p>For the same price as a brand new family car you could be the owner of the cheapest house currently for sale in Wales.</p>
      <p>While there may be houses going to auction with a similar guide price, this run down cute cottage is being marketed through an estate agent instead - and the hammer on auction properties rarely falls at such a low price.</p>
      <p>But if you are interested then you will need to act quickly. According to the estate agent selling the one bed mid-terrace in <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/welshpool">Welshpool</a>, Powys, an interested buyer has put forward an offer of £25,000.</p>
      <p>If no other offers are received by the end of this week, contracts will be exchanged on this chain-free property.</p>

      <p>As the home is described as derelict, it is aimed at cash buyers but also brave buyers.</p>
      <p>There are metal supports in place that are literally holding up the first floor and potential buyers who may want to view the property are advised that they do so at their own risk.</p>
      <p>Outside the stone terrace is a sweet abode, with character and definite potential.</p>
      <p>Inside, initially the derelict state of the property might be a bit of a shock but arguably that is to be expected at this price.</p>
      <p>Yes, there's a lot of work to be done but at least a new owner won't have to spend time and money ripping the rotten insides out as the former home is already back to brick.</p>

      <p>The downstairs is one open space measuring about 5.7 metres by 3 metres and would make a cosy open-plan living, dining and lounge area focused around the large fireplace once <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/renovation">fully renovated</a>.</p>
      <p>If it's possible structurally, imagine how homely the property would be after installing a log burner in the fireplace as the cornerstone of a classic country cottage <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/all-about/interior-design">interior design</a>.</p>
      <p>Wooden or flagstone flooring, exposed stone and brick walls and a Shaker-style kitchen would complete the look.</p>
      <p>Usually this would be the point where a potential buyer would climb the stairs to have a nose around the first floor - but there are no stairs.</p>
      <p>Or floor, or bedroom, or bathroom.</p>

        <figcaption>There's a garden under there somewhere<cite>(Image: McCartneys estate agents Welshpool)</cite></figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>But there is a cute rear garden that also needs some attention.</p>
      <p>There is a neighbour right of way across a section of it but once the strimmer is out and achieving greatness in the battle against the undergrowth, the garden will be a fantastic bonus to the property.</p>
      <p>Once a comprehensive programme of works has been completed inside too, a new owner is likely to enjoy living in the cheapest house in Wales, knowing they have undoubtedly added value to what was once a stone shell by bringing it back to life.</p>
