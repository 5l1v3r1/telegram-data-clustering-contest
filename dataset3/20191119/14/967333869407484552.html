      <p>The suspect was detained in his Berlin home during a raid, conducted as part of a probe into his plans to "commit a serious act of violence against the state," the press release read.</p>
      <p>The 37-year-old was found to have been active since last spring in a chat in the Telegram messenger app closely linked to the Islamic State terror group (banned in Russia).</p>
      <p>The group exchanged instructions on how to <a href="https://sputniknews.com/analysis/201908021076433257-whats-behind-upsurge-in-anti-muslim-hoax-bomb-attacks-mosque-desecration-in-germany/">build weapons and explosive devices</a>, including plastic explosives, magnet bombs, AK-47 assault rifles and sub-machine guns.</p>
      <blockquote>"The purpose of the chat was apparently to prepare terrorist attacks," the Berlin prosecutor’s office said.</blockquote>
      <p>The federal prosecutor’s office said in a separate statement that the search of the suspect’s apartment aimed to confirm suspicions about the man, whom it described as a radical Islamist.</p>
      <p>It said he had been procuring elements and chemicals needed to build a bomb since January this year.</p>
      <blockquote>"This was to be set off at an unknown time in an unknown location in Germany to kill and injure as many people as possible," the statement read.</blockquote>
      <p>The suspect bought acetone in August and hydrogen peroxide in September. These, the federal prosecution said, were components of the highly volatile TATP explosive.</p>
