      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/katie-price/">Katie Price</a>’s mucky mansion has been the focus of a headline (or 20) but the former glamour model is putting some elbow grease into tidying up her home.</p>
      <p>Photos of Katie getting stuck in with the cleaning have emerged, and it looks like she needed to invest in <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/15/inside-katie-prices-2million-house-graffiti-walls-piles-underwear-hits-back-mucky-mansion-claims-10924475/">some protective gear before taking on the mammoth task.</a></p>
      <p>Katie suited up in full white overalls, complete with a hood to keep her hair clean and dusters fixed to her elbows, knees and feet.</p>
      <p>We’re not quite sure shuffling around on all fours is going to be the most effective way of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/23/katie-prices-mucky-mansion-dirty-gave-kerry-katona-anxiety-10966644/">making her cluttered home liveable again</a>, but we’ll give her an A+ for effort.</p>
      <p>The look may be a far cry from her glamorous modelling days, but it’s definitely going to make some pretty excellent content for her upcoming show, My Crazy Life.</p>

      <p>Katie’s spent the past few months renovating her home after it was given the less than favourable moniker when fans spotted the junk and mess cluttering up her home in the back of her videos.</p>
      <p>The mother of five, 41, has kept tight-lipped about her plans for the £2million Sussex home, with rumours she was turning it into a wedding venue or<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/09/katie-price-renovates-mucky-mansion-in-bid-to-sell-2million-home-as-makeover-costs-spiral-out-of-control-11070063/"> doing it up in order to sell the property on</a>.</p>

      <p>Fans were treated to a guided tour of the house on Katie’s YouTube channel where she showed off her home in the middle of the renovation.</p>
      <p>She explained: ‘My house… Everyone is calling it “mucky mansion”. Yes, because I’m not living in my house. It’s empty.</p>

      <p>‘I’m doing stuff to it and something has gone wrong. I’ll explain that in due course. I have builders inside my house, my post gets moved here, there and everywhere.’</p>
      <p>Katie had revealed she moved out of the main home and into her annexe while the works were being done.</p>
      <p>Here’s hoping the elbow dusters hold up – it looks like there was plenty of use for them.</p>
