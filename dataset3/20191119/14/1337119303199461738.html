      <h1>Eero launches new mobile app with simplified design</h1>
      <h2>Quicker access to information and dark mode support, but no HomeKit yet</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T14:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/dan-seifert" target="_blank">Dan Seifert</a></address>
      <p>Mesh router system Eero has announced the biggest update to its mobile app since its launch in 2016. The new Eero app, which is available for iOS devices starting today and will be arriving for Android early next year, offers a simplified design and cleaner visuals than the prior version. It’s available as a free upgrade for the existing app.</p>
      <p>The biggest change is the move to a tabbed layout with four distinct pages, as opposed to the slide-out menu navigation of the old app. The four tabs are labeled Home, Activity, Discover, and Settings. The Home tab provides a quick overview of the network, including which devices are currently connected. Conveniently, it separates the devices by category, such as Computers &amp; Personal, Entertainment, and so on. This page also includes a prominent button in the upper-right corner to quickly add a device to the network, either through a QR code or Amazon Wi-Fi simple setup.</p>
      <p>The second tab shows the various network activity info and recent security scans from Eero’s Secure subscription service. If you don’t subscribe to the service, this page will look fairly barren, as it will only show recent speed test results.</p>

      <p>The Discover tab will be a showcase for new features and services available, such as the Eero Secure service or Amazon’s Wi-Fi simple setup. Hopefully, it doesn’t turn into a wasteland of pushy ads to get you to sign up for services, but we’ll see. In a statement about the new design, Eero CEO Nick Weaver said, “We are eager to roll out more integrations so customers can use all of their favorite smart home devices to connect, secure, and manage their connected home.”</p>
      <p>Finally, the fourth tab is where you can access the app’s settings, including the new dark mode support for iOS 13 and newer. One thing that this update doesn’t bring is HomeKit support, which was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18646453/apple-homekit-support-smart-home-security-routers-wwdc-2019">announced earlier this year</a>. An Eero representative said the company had “nothing to share on HomeKit” when asked about it.</p>
