      <h1>Pandemonium Over Ecocash Upgrade, Zimbabweans React</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T14:02:59+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 14:02</time> by <a rel="author">Andrew</a></address>
      <p>Mobile money giant, EcoCash, is under fire from its subscribers over the sporadic service availability following a major systems upgrade which began last week Saturday.</p>
      <p>Last week, EcoCash issued a notice to its customers that it was going to<a href="https://iharare.com/ecocash-warns-of-full-shutdown-of-all-services/"> shut-down all its services for 24 hours to improve system availability.</a> Consequently, EcoCash services were not available from 9 pm on Saturday to 9 pm on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Following the scheduled resumption of the system, <a href="https://iharare.com/users-unable-to-buy-airtime-after-ecocash-upgrade/">yesterday, users were unable to buy airtime</a>, sparking rumours that the feature had been terminated on the platform. The platform was also down in shops, dealing a heavy blow to businesses and retailers.</p>
      <p>Ironically, the upgrade which was meant to facilitate efficient service delivery has thus far created chaos.  Social media has since been flooded with complaints from EcoCash’s customers venting out their frustrations.</p>
      <p>In a statement, Ecocash’s parent company, Cassava Smartech Zimbabwe’s chief executive Mr Eddie Chibi said that they were currently seized with post over stability issues after they moved to a new platform.</p>
      <aside>We successfully implemented the planned upgrade of Ecocash to a new, more secure platform, and would like to thank our valued customers for their patience over this period.<br/>However we are dealing with post-cut stability issues to optimise the availability of various EcoCash services across the new platform, and once again request our customers to bear with us as this may result in intermittent services.</aside>
