      <p>Officials from the Israeli police department's internal investigations division met today (Tuesday) with relatives of Solomon Tekah, the Ethiopian-Israeli teen killed after an off-duty policy officer fired a warning shot during an altercation, to update them on their decision regarding the prosecution of the officer in question.</p>
      <p>On Tuesday, the police officer was charged with negligent homicide, rather than manslaughter, which had been originally considered by prosecutors. Negligent homicide carries a maximum sentence of three years in prison, while manslaughter carries a maximum sentence of 20 years.</p>
      <p>Attorney Yair Nadshi, who represents the police officer, spoke to <i>103FM</i> regarding the development<i>.</i></p>
      <p>"Today, I will receive the decision of internal investigation office in the case of my client. According to leaked claims, he will be charged with negligent homicide and not manslaughter."</p>
      <p>
        <b>What's your opinion on that?</b>
      </p>
      <p>"There is no case to charge him with any crime. His actions, in the situation he was in, were correct. He acted out of self defense.</p>
      <p>
        <b>What evidence supports your claims?</b>
      </p>
      <p>"I'm afraid I cannot answer that until the case begins in court. According to reports in the press, there is a ballistic report and a post-mortem report that support my clients claims and prove that my client did not aim at the victim, but only shot for effect."</p>
      <p>
        <b>The case caused a huge controversy, with huge demonstrations among the </b>
        <b>Ethiopian</b>
        <b> community. Has that hurt your client's chances?</b>
      </p>
      <p>"My opinion, as well as others that share it, is that if this case wouldn't have become so public my client wouldn't be charged with any crime.</p>
      <p>
        <b>You are saying something dramatic, that your client's case is </b>
        <b>dependent</b>
        <b> on public pressure.</b>
      </p>
      <p>"Public pressure is part of the system. It's part of the law, a case can be closed if there is no public interest."</p>
      <p>
        <b>How does your client feel?</b>
      </p>
      <p>"His situation is not good. His life is in danger, he cannot continue his life as normal.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Does he want to return to the police?</b>
      </p>
      <p>He wants to. We want him to have a hearing in order to return to work.</p>
