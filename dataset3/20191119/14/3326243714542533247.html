      <p>With some great new features that came with iOS 13 and iPadOS, <a href="https://www.idownloadblog.com/2019/06/11/notes-ios-13-overview/">the Notes app received a nice update</a>. One of those improvements includes enhancements to the search feature. You can now search for items within images and scans you’ve attached to your notes.</p>
      <p>Want to find that photo of your car in a note from last year? Need the invoice scan you sent Mr. Jones? If it’s attached to a note, you can find it easily. Here’s how to search for images, attachments, and scans in Notes on iOS.</p>
      <h3>Search images and scans</h3>
      <p>You can use a keyword to find an object in a photo or word in a scan that you attached to a note.</p>
      <p>Open the <b>Notes</b> app on your iPhone or iPad and go to a <b>folder</b> where you believe the item is kept or use <b>All iCloud</b> to search them all.</p>
      <p>Swipe down slightly on the screen to reveal the search box at the top and enter your search term.</p>
      <p>The app should recognize objects in images that you have attached. For instance, you can see in the screenshot below that I searched for “crowd,” and that’s exactly the photo that was found.</p>

      <p>You can enter a word to search for a document that you have scanned and attached. For example, in the screenshot below you can see that I searched for “receipt,” and Notes found both a scan and a note with my keyword.</p>

      <h3>Search for attachments with notes</h3>
      <p>Remember that you can also find notes that have attachments. For instance, you know that you scanned a document and attached it to a note, but can’t find that note.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Go to a <b>folder</b> or pick <b>All iCloud</b>.</li>
        <li>Tap the <b>More</b> button and pick <b>View Attachments</b>.</li>
        <li>When you see the attachment for the note, <b>tap and hold</b>.</li>
        <li>Then pick <b>Show in Note</b>.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>You’ll then be taken to the note containing the attachment.</p>
      <h3>Wrapping it up</h3>
      <p>Finding images, scans, and attachments in the Notes app is now easier than ever thanks to the search improvements that came with <a href="https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-13/features/">iOS 13</a> and <a href="https://www.apple.com/ipados/features/">iPadOS</a>.</p>
