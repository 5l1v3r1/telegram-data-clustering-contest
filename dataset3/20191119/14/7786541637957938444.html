      <p>Middle District of Alabama U.S. Attorney Louis V. Franklin Sr. said Monday the jury decided Dumas conspired with others to steal the money, <a href="https://www.al.com/news/montgomery/2019/11/montgomery-man-convicted-in-theft-of-nearly-200000-from-wind-creek-casino.html">AL.com</a> reported.</p>
      <p>Dumas and Timothy Dean Pettiway were <a href="https://www.fox13memphis.com/news/trending-now/man-charged-in-theft-of-192800-from-alabama-casino/816856683">arrested</a> in August 2018 after they were accused of stealing money from two machines that were accessed when an employee at the Wind Creek Casino Montgomery left keys atop a kiosk Aug. 10.</p>
      <p>According to prosecutors, Dumas, a former employee of the casino who investigators said was fired for theft in 2017, conspired with Pettway, Taneka Thomas and Courtney Deandra Stanton to take money from the casino, the <a href="https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/2019/11/18/montgomery-man-convicted-wind-creek-casino-theft/4232001002/">Advertiser</a> reported.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors said Stanton left the keys on top of a kiosk, and they were taken by Pettway, <a href="https://www.al.com/news/montgomery/2019/11/montgomery-man-convicted-in-theft-of-nearly-200000-from-wind-creek-casino.html">AL.com </a>reported. Pettway took two cash cassettes and handed them to Dumas, who took the $192,800, prosecutors said.</p>
      <p>In August 2019, Pettiway was sentenced to 33 months in federal prison, <a href="https://www.al.com/news/montgomery/2019/11/montgomery-man-convicted-in-theft-of-nearly-200000-from-wind-creek-casino.html">AL.com</a> reported. Thomas and Stanton have pleaded guilty and are awaiting sentencing, the website reported.</p>
