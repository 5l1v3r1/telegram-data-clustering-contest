      <h1>Local news outlets can fill the media trust gap – but the public needs to pony up</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T14:05:41+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 14:05</time> by <a rel="author">Damian Radcliffe</a></address>
      <p>With the polarization of America’s media and <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/11/impeachment-democrats-republicans-polarization/601264/">politics</a> reaching a fever pitch, many news consumers – “worn out by a fog of political news,” as a recent New York Times feature <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/18/us/polls-media-fake-news.html">put it</a> – are responding by tuning out altogether.</p>
      <p>Media distrust, which has <a href="https://www.edelman.com/trust-barometer">intensified globally</a> in recent years, is also a likely factor. A recent Gallup poll <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/267047/americans-trust-mass-media-edges-down.aspx">found</a> only 13% of Americans trust the media “a great deal,” while 28% indicated that they trust the media “a fair amount.”</p>
      <p>However, evidence suggests a more favorable situation for local journalism.</p>
      <p><a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/%7Ebnyhan/media-trust-report-2018.pdf">Poynter’s 2018 Media Trust Survey</a> and a recent <a href="https://www.knightfoundation.org/reports/state-of-public-trust-in-local-news">Knight Foundation-Gallup study</a> each found that trust in local media is higher than for national media.</p>
      <p>Only 31% of Americans say they trust reporting from national news outlets “a great deal” or “quite a lot,” while 45% of Americans say the same for reporting from local news organizations.</p>
      <p>Forty-five percent still isn’t great; clearly, there’s work to be done. These efforts are complicated by the fact that <a href="https://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/2019/11/01/end-of-local-news/">many newsrooms are struggling financially</a>.</p>
      <p>Despite this backdrop, I’m optimistic. I’ve spent two decades <a href="https://damianradcliffe.wordpress.com/about/hyperlocal/">researching</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/damianradcliffe/">working in</a> local news. I believe local media outlets are in a position to creatively cater to audiences burned out by beltway drama.</p>
      <p>Here are four ways local newsrooms can forge deeper relationships with the communities they serve.</p>
      <h3>1. Interact with readers</h3>
      <p>With newsroom employment <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/07/09/u-s-newsroom-employment-has-dropped-by-a-quarter-since-2008/">down 25% since 2008</a> – the equivalent of 28,000 jobs – there are fewer boots on the ground. Nonetheless, opportunities to engage with audiences are greater than ever.</p>
      <p>One way is to be visible – online and in real life.</p>
      <p>Journalists can think about opportunities for face-to-face interaction with readers. Some outlets have started holding <a href="https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/slow-news-venture-tortoise-creates-inclusive-members-model-with-potential-to-extend-into-local-journalism/">open editorial meetings</a>, in which journalists discuss the stories they’re developing, or <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/brews-and-news-with-voice-of-san-diego-journalists-march-20th-tickets-55609776338">meet-and-greets</a> with the public. There are also opportunities to engage with readers via social media, whether it’s through <a href="https://www.facebook.com/facebookmedia/success-stories/globalnews-live">Facebook Live</a> or Q&amp;As on Reddit, also known as “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/a4wvov/we_are_the_journalists_who_produced_the/">Ask Me Anything</a>.”</p>
      <p>These efforts matter, because local journalists are often the only journalists people ever meet. As a result, they can serve as a <a href="https://theconversation.com/how-local-journalism-can-upend-the-fake-news-narrative-104630">proxy for perceptions of the wider industry</a>.</p>
      <h3>2. Teach the process</h3>
      <p>Another way to build trust is to explain how journalism works.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.cjr.org/special_report/how-does-journalism-happen-poll.php">Research suggests</a> audiences don’t understand how journalism is produced, nor do they understand some of the terminology reporters deploy.</p>
      <p>For example, a <a href="https://www.cjr.org/special_report/how-does-journalism-happen-poll.php">2018 survey</a> found 60% of respondents believed reporters get paid by their sources “sometimes or very often.” <a href="https://twitter.com/mayerjoy">Joy Mayer</a>, director of the <a href="https://medium.com/trusting-news">Trusting News</a> project, <a href="https://soundcloud.com/demystifying-media/joy-mayer">told me</a> that when journalists talk about “anonymous sources,” many people assume the journalist doesn’t know who the source is, either.</p>
      <p>It’s not difficult to <a href="https://niemanstoryboard.org/storyboard-category/annotation-tuesday/">address this</a>, and doing so could help engender more trust in journalistic practice.</p>
      <p>In December 2018, for example, journalists at The Oregonian published <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/news/2019/02/the-oregonianoregonlives-ghosts-of-highway-20-named-finalist-for-scripps-howard-award.html">a series</a> about five seemingly disparate crimes and their connection to John Ackroyd, a convicted murderer. But they didn’t just publish the pieces and wait for <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/editors/2019/06/the-oregonianoregonlives-ghosts-of-highway-20-wins-4-regional-emmy-awards.html">the awards</a>. They also shared articles <a href="https://www.oregonlive.com/news/2018/12/ghosts-of-highway-20-how-we-reported-the-series.html">outlining</a> their reporting methods, alongside an <a href="https://projects.oregonlive.com/ghostsofhighway20/stories-annotated.pdf">annotated version of the full series</a> with footnotes and links to related documents.</p>
      <h3>3. Give readers what they want</h3>
      <p>Without this type of transparency, as a recent Knight report <a href="https://knightfoundation.org/articles/local-news-is-more-trusted-than-national-news-but-that-could-change/">acknowledged</a>, trust in local news “is vulnerable to the same perceptions of partisan bias that threaten confidence in the national media.”</p>
      <p>One further way to try to eliminate this is to cede some control to the audience.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2017/12/the-editorial-meeting-of-the-future/">In an article published by Harvard’s Nieman Lab</a>, newsroom consultant Jennifer Brandel and editor Mónica Guzmán argue that it’s important for journalists to shift their approach to coverage.</p>
      <p>The editorial meeting of the future, they write, “won’t start with our ideas – we’ll start with the information gaps the public demonstrates they have, and focus our efforts squarely on filling those gaps.”</p>
      <p>Getting audiences to <a href="https://www.scpr.org/socal-so-curious/">submit questions</a> and <a href="https://listenerspodcast.uoregon.edu/">listening</a> to their needs can actually <a href="https://www.kuow.org/stories/you-won-t-believe-what-s-at-the-bottom-of-lake-washington">result in stories</a> that journalists might not otherwise have produced.</p>
      <p>The Knight Foundation’s <a href="https://knightfoundation.org/press/releases/new-gallup-knight-study-local-news-should-be-available-to-all-yet-americans-divided-on-how-to-pay-for-it/">recent research</a> highlighted opportunities to put this principle into operation. Nearly two-thirds of their respondents want more coverage on subjects like drug addiction, K-12 education, the environment and planned public works. They also want local outlets <a href="https://www.americanpressinstitute.org/publications/reports/white-papers/characteristics-effective-accountability-journalists/">to do a better job</a> holding those in power accountable.</p>
      <h3>4. Encourage readers to pay</h3>
      <p>However, the uncertain finances of many small newsrooms are a major roadblock to experimentation and giving readers the content they crave.</p>
      <p>Declining revenue has meant more than 1 in 5, or 1,800, local newspapers <a href="https://www.salon.com/2018/10/16/the-u-s-newspaper-crisis-is-growing-more-than-1-in-5-local-papers-have-closed-since-2004/">have closed</a> since 2004. Today, over 1,300 communities <a href="https://www.poynter.org/business-work/2018/about-1300-u-s-communities-have-totally-lost-news-coverage-unc-news-desert-study-finds/">lack</a> original local reporting.</p>
      <p>Most readers simply don’t realize how dire the situation is for some outlets.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.journalism.org/2019/03/26/most-americans-think-their-local-news-media-are-doing-well-financially-few-help-to-support-it/">According to the Pew Research Center</a>, 71% of Americans “think their local news media are doing just fine financially.” This may explain why only 14% of them financially supported a local news source in the past year.</p>
      <p>Yet <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2019/11/americans-are-more-willing-to-pay-for-local-news-when-they-knew-local-newspapers-are-in-trouble-a-new-study-says/">readers indicated</a> that they “were more likely to subscribe or otherwise support their local newspaper if it were the only one in their area and at risk of shutting down.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://knightfoundation.org/reports/putting-a-price-tag-on-local-news/">New research</a> shows that audiences value local news, and 61% of Americans <a href="https://kf-site-production.s3.amazonaws.com/media_elements/files/000/000/440/original/State_of_Public_Trust_in_Local_Media_final_.pdf">say</a> their local news organizations do an “excellent” or “good” job covering what’s going on in their area. But the Knight Foundation’s latest report, “<a href="https://knightfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Putting-a-Price-Tag-on-Local-News-final-updated.pdf">Putting a Price Tag on Local News</a>,” also finds that few readers are currently paying for it.</p>
      <p>Clearly, many readers don’t realize how precarious things are. Newsrooms therefore must make a better case for the value of their work and why it needs to be supported.</p>
      <h3>A civic imperative</h3>
      <p>Until then, local outlets will have to <a href="https://www.niemanlab.org/2019/11/doing-more-with-less-seven-practical-tips-for-local-newsrooms-to-strrrrretch-their-resources/">do more with less</a>.</p>
      <p>This isn’t easy. But even the smallest newsrooms, like the <a href="https://www.cgsentinel.com/">Cottage Grove Sentinel</a> in Oregon, have been able to successfully experiment with <a href="https://cgsentinel.com/article/grove-report-january-22-2019">new formats</a> and ways <a href="https://medium.com/damian-radcliffe/the-rise-of-engagement-online-and-in-real-life-11a0c261a500">to engage with readers</a>.</p>
      <p>Americans <a href="https://www.journalism.org/2019/03/26/americans-give-fairly-high-marks-to-their-local-news-media-especially-when-journalists-are-seen-as-connected-to-the-community/">believe local news outlets</a> are accurate, useful, trustworthy and caring. Yet without a vibrant local news industry, <a href="https://www.doi.org/10.1177/1078087419838058">fewer people run for office</a> and citizens become <a href="https://journalistsresource.org/studies/society/news-media/local-newspapers-civic-engagement/">less engaged</a> about elections.</p>
      <p>“The diminishment of local news is to democracies what climate change is to the environment,” argues <a href="https://localnewsinitiative.northwestern.edu/people/tim-franklin/">Tim Franklin</a>, the head of Northwestern University’s <a href="https://localnewsinitiative.northwestern.edu/">Medill Local News Initiative</a>. “It’s a slow-motion crisis, the effects of which we’re just beginning to see.”</p>
      <p>The appetite for hard-hitting, relevant, local news is clearly there. The big question is how best to tap into it and satiate it – all while ensuring local journalists can pay the bills.</p>
