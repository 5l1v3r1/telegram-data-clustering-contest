      <p>CHICAGO, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Following are U.S. trade expectations for the opening of grain and soy complex trading at the Chicago Board of Trade at 8:30 a.m. CST (1430 GMT) on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>WHEAT - Steady to up 1 cent per bushel</p>
      <p>* Mild round of short-covering expected wheat after most-active CBOT soft red winter wheat contract hit lowest on a continuous basis since Oct. 11 on Monday. Technical resistance expected to curtail rally attempts.</p>
      <p>* Benchmark CBOT December soft red winter wheat contract failed to hold support above five-day moving average during overnight trading session.</p>
      <p>* CBOT December soft red winter wheat last traded up 1/4 cent at $5.07-1/2 per bushel. K.C. December hard red winter wheat was last up 1/4 cent at $4.18-3/4, and MGEX December spring wheat was last down 1/4 cent at $5.03.</p>
      <p>CORN - Steady to up 1 cent per bushel</p>
      <p>* Slow harvest pace supports corn but light demand limits strength in the market. Forecasts for rain in Brazil and Argentina pressuring corn.</p>
      <p>* The U.S. Agriculture Department said that U.S. corn harvest was 76% complete as of Nov. 17. Analysts had been expecting 77%. The five-year average is 92%.</p>
      <p>* CBOT December corn last traded up 1 cent at $3.68-3/4 per bushel.</p>
      <p>SOYBEANS - Up 3 cents to 5 cents per bushel</p>
      <p>* Soybean market firming on bargain buying after most-active contract dropped to lowest since Oct. 4 on Monday. Uncertainty about progress in U.S.-China trade negotiations, South American weather outlook keep gains in check.</p>
      <p>* Benchmark CBOT January soybean futures contract rose above 100-day moving average overnight.</p>
      <p>* USDA said soybean harvest was 91% complete, matching market expectations. The five-year average is 95%.</p>
      <p>* CBOT January soybeans last traded up 3-1/4 cents at $9.13-1/2 per bushel. (Reporting by Mark Weinraub Editing by Nick Zieminski)</p>
