      <p>Israel’s prime minister travelled to the West Bank to celebrate the US’s announcement that it does not consider Israeli settlements to violate international law.</p>
      <p>Benjamin Netanyahu called the Trump administration’s declaration, which stepped back from four decades of US policy and reversed the policies of President Barack Obama, a “huge achievement” that “fixed a historic wrong”.</p>
      <p>“I think it is a great day for the state of Israel and an achievement that will remain for decades,” he said.</p>
      <p>Mr Netanyahu spoke at a gathering of ecstatic supporters and settler leaders in Alon Shvut, a settlement outside of Jerusalem.</p>

      <p>Israeli right-wing leaders welcomed US secretary of state Mike Pompeo’s announcement.</p>
      <p>Although it is largely symbolic, it fuelled calls from settler supporters for increased construction or even the annexation of parts of the West Bank.</p>
      <p>The Palestinians, who claim the West Bank as part of a future state, condemned the decision.</p>

      <p>Over 400,000 settlers now live in the West Bank, in addition to more than 200,000 settlers in east Jerusalem, the Palestinian’s hoped-for capital.</p>
      <p>The Palestinians and the international community say that settlements are illegal and prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state.</p>

      <p>The head of the Arab League joined the large number of critics, condemning the Trump administration’s latest decision “in the strongest terms”.</p>
      <p>The league’s secretary-general, Ahmed Aboul Gheit, said the decision would result in “more violence and cruelty” against the Palestinians at the hands of the Israeli settlers and “undermines any possibility” of achieving peace.</p>

      <p>The White House says it has developed a Mideast peace plan, but it has not yet unveiled it.</p>
      <p>The Palestinians already have rejected the plan, accusing the US of unfair bias in favour of Israel.</p>
      <p>The Trump administration has made a number of moves in favour of Israel, recognising Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, recognising Israel’s annexation of the Golan Heights and closing the Palestinian diplomatic offices in Washington.</p>
