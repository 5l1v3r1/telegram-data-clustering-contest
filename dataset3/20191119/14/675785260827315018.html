      <p>"And that's when I sensed the roo was panicking and thinking 'I'm being attacked on all sides.</p>
      <p>"He looked at me and I knew what was going to happen.</p>
      <p>"Something made me turn around. He attacked me from behind and he knocked me to the ground.</p>

      <p>"He gouged out the back of my leg, I know now if I hadn't turned around, I would probably have been disembowelled."</p>
