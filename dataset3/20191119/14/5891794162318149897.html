      <h1>Bosnian Leaders Break 13-Month Deadlock With Nomination Of Prime Minister</h1>

      <p>Some 13 months after a general election, Bosnia-Herzegovina's tripartite presidency has broken a deadlock with the nomination of economist Zoran Tegeltija as the prime minister-designate.<br/><br/>The heads of the three parties representing ethnic Serbs, Croats, and Bosniaks <b><a href="https://www.slobodnaevropa.org/a/30280415.html">nominated Tegeltija </a></b>on November 19 as the new head of the Council of Ministers, Bosnia's de facto government.<br/><br/>Bosniak leader Sefik Dzaferovic said that the winners of the decision "are all the people and citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina."<br/><br/>The move must be confirmed by the country's parliament.<br/><br/>Tegeltija was previously nominated by Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik, but the leaders of the other two entities opposed the move over concerns he wasnâ€™t committed to pushing the country along the path toward NATO membership.<br/><br/>While the Bosniak and Croat members want Bosnia to work toward NATO accession, pro-Russian Dodik has said that he would prefer Bosnia to remain neutral and outside of the security alliance.<br/><br/>Dodik has resisted the transmission of an annual plan of reforms to NATO, which would trigger its push for membership which has been blocked by Serbs in Bosnia for a decade.<br/><br/>More than 20 years after a devastating war pulled the fledgling landlocked country of under 4 million people apart along ethnic lines, Bosnia is still trying to shake off the effects.<br/><br/>The country is run by a government that includes a three-member presidency drawn along ethnic lines and two autonomous political entities.<br/><br/>Parliamentary elections in October 2018 underlined the same divisive rhetoric that sparked fighting almost three decades ago and highlighted Bosnia's crossroads -- either it continues to try to deepen Euro-Atlantic ties or its ethnic rivalries further derail progress toward the EU and NATO and hamper economic and political efforts.</p>
