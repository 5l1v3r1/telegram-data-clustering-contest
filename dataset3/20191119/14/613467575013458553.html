      <h1>Tesla to showcase Made-in-China Model 3 at local stores later this week</h1>

      <p>Tesla may still be waiting for its final sales permit in China before it can start the initial deliveries of the Made-in-China Model 3, but the electric car maker is already busy promoting its locally-made creation. This is highlighted by Tesla reportedly showcasing the MIC Model 3 in several of its local stores as early as this Friday, November 22, 2019. </p>
      <p>Local reports point to the Gigafactory 3-manufactured Model 3 being deployed to all Tesla China showrooms across the country. This means that later this week, locally-produced Model 3 units will likely be making an appearance in different cities across China. This bodes well for the electric car maker, as it would allow Tesla to <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-model-3-production-gigafactory-3-3k-per-week/">establish its local presence</a> even in areas beyond key cities such as Shanghai. </p>

      <p>Based on teasers of the locally-made Model 3 that have been shared online so far, it appears that all-electric sedans selected for the upcoming awareness campaign will be painted blue, similar to the other locally-made units that have been used by local media in their reviews. The vehicles also appear to be equipped with 18″ Aero Wheels and an all-black interior.  </p>
      <p>Apart from the country-wide initiative, Tesla will reportedly showcase the Made-in-China Model 3 at the Guangzhou International Motor Show as well. Interestingly, the event is also scheduled for November 22, the same day when the Made-in-China Model 3 will be showcased at local Tesla stores. This event would likely be one of the first instances when the Made-in-China Model 3 gets <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-model-3-awd-gigafactory-3-production-q1-2020/">formally introduced to the local Chinese market</a>.</p>

      <p>The pieces are now falling into place for Tesla in China. While the company is still waiting for a final approval before it could conduct deliveries of the Made-in-China Model 3, the electric car maker has already been granted a license to <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-gigafactory-3-gets-model-3-mass-production-license/">produce the vehicle at scale</a>. Considering that Gigafactory 3 is now operational, it would not be surprising if Tesla China is already producing the MIC Model 3 even as it waits for the vehicle’s final permits. </p>
      <p>Gigafactory 3 has the potential to be a massive difference-maker for Tesla. The facility’s first phase, which is designed to produce and assemble the Model 3 (and later, the Model Y), was completed in record time. A second phase, which will be a battery facility, is also under construction on the southern end of the Gigafactory 3 complex. Gigafactory 3 Phase 2 is being <a href="https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-gigafactory-3-battery-facility-buildout-model-3-china-video/">built at a very rapid pace</a> as well, with the facility’s roofing being more and more complete every week.</p>
