      <h1>Two in five parents regret the school they chose for their kids</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T14:00:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 14:00</time> by <a rel="author">Jordan Baker</a></address>
      <p>Two in five parents would choose a different school for their children if they had the choice again.</p>
      <p>But parents were less likely to have regrets if they did their own research by visiting the school, speaking to staff or using information on the My School website, rather than relying on word of mouth or doing no research.</p>
      <p>The Centre for Independent Studies, a think tank that supports freedom of choice in education, polled more than 1000 parents from state and non-government schools to gauge their views on school selection and funding for its paper, <a href="https://www.cis.org.au/app/uploads/2019/11/pp26-emb.pdf"><i>What Do Parents Want from Schools?</i></a></p>
      <p>Parents were most likely to prioritise location, facilities and results, then consider cost, discipline and their child's interests when choosing a school, the national survey found. They were least likely to care about whether the school was single-sex or not.</p>
      <p>The most popular source of information (53 per cent) was family and friends, but almost as many parents visited the school, two in five checked the school's website, a third spoke to staff, and a quarter visited the <a href="https://myschool.edu.au/">My School</a> website, which publishes financial, demographic, attendance and NAPLAN data.</p>
      <p>When asked whether they would make the same choice again, more than 40 per cent said they were unsure or would not, with 70 per cent of families in the Catholic system, 68 per cent in the independent sector, and 57 per cent in the government system saying they would choose the same school if cost was not a factor.</p>
      <p>The author of the paper, CIS research fellow Glenn Fahey, said Australia should not be content with an education system in which two in five parents were not willing to endorse their child's school. "If that kind of customer satisfaction ranking were in any other industry, it would not take long to go out of business," he said.</p>
      <p>He said parents should be given greater choice and more information on which to base their decisions. "From a policy perspective ... should be providing as many resources as possible to help parents feel confident that they are picking the right school," Mr Fahey said.</p>
      <p>Adrian Piccoli, director of the Gonski Institute for Education - a think tank focusing on equity in schooling - said parents who chose non-government schools might have felt more satisfied because those schools could choose their students, while public schools were required to take everybody.</p>
      <p>"Private schools can essentially select who their cohort is, and that's a big advantage," he said. "If you are a student and your parents are happy to pay the school fees but you are running amok ... that school can, one way or the other, get you out."</p>

      <p>Professor Piccoli said satisfaction included factors that were beyond schools' control. "If a student's experience hasn't been what you might have expected, it's not just the school," he said. "It might be the student and all the other influences on that student."</p>
      <p>The poll also found 88 per cent of parents thought their school was at least adequately resourced, including 86 per cent of students at government schools. Parents' spending priorities were facilities and extra curricular activities.</p>
      <p>Mr Fahey called on schools to make their spending decisions more transparent, "as a way to increase parental confidence in their school's use of resources, particularly for government schools," he said.</p>
