      <p>EE has announced the expansion of its 5G network to 14 new towns and cities, including Liverpool, Glasgow and Huddersfield for the first time.</p>
      <p>The mobile operator said independent tests by network performance firm RootMetrics had also found its network now covered 60% of London.</p>
      <p>As part of the new expansion, EE said it had introduced 5G in Castlereagh, Guildford, Hamilton, Harlow, Hoddesdon, Kimberley, Lisburn, Maidstone, Sydenham, Watford and Wolverhampton.</p>
      <p>5G is the next generation of mobile data network, offering speeds several times that of current-generation 4G.</p>
      <p>EE – which is owned by BT – began its 5G network rollout in May, initially launching coverage in London, Edinburgh, Belfast, Cardiff, Birmingham and Manchester.</p>
      <p>Fellow operators Vodafone, O2 and Three have since begun their own introductions of 5G coverage.</p>
      <p>BT consumer division chief executive Marc Allera said of the update: “Switching on 5G in more places is helping us deliver the best mobile experience to our customers, keeping them connected to the things that matter most.</p>
      <p>“RootMetrics’ early 5G testing shows that we are a long way ahead in terms of 5G performance and our engineers are continuing to build new sites every day, on our journey to keeping our customers connected 100% of the time.”</p>
      <p>EE said its latest rollout also included introducing 5G to new areas of high football, including Bristol Parkway, Cardiff Castle and Camden Market and Carnaby Street in London.</p>
