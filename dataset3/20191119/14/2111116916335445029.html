      <p>It's that time of year when you're likely to be doing a lot of cooking – so get some help in the kitchen with the KitchenAid Artisan mixer, now £220 off RRP in the early <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/black-friday/currys-black-friday-deals-2019-what-to-expect-this-year">Currys Black Friday</a> sales.</p>
      <p>When it comes to discounts on the latest must-have tech, you're not going to get much better than almost half off this mixer, which will now set you back £279 rather than the original £499. It's also on sale at other retailers for a touch more, and this is one of the cheapest prices we can find it for at the moment.</p>

      <p>With 300W of power and a choice of speed levels, the 4.8-litre capacity mixer can mix, beat, whisk and knead, and is going to make short work of whatever ingredients you put in front of it.</p>
      <p>In the box you get a stainless steel mixing bowl, a flat beater, a six-wire whip and a dough hook as well as the mixer itself. Add a five-year guarantee, and it's one of the best <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/black-friday/black-friday-deals-2019">Black Friday deals</a> we've seen so far – and Black Friday isn't even here yet.</p>
      <p>What's more, it's part of the Currys Black Friday price promise - meaning that if it does plummet in price on Black Friday itself (November 29) you'll be able to get the difference back.</p>
