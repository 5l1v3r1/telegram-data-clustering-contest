      <p>SAO PAULO, Nov 19 (Reuters) - A bid by U.S.-based fund Amerra Capital Management LLC to buy one of the mills from Brazilian sugar and ethanol producer Clealco failed to win approval from a group of creditors of the Brazilian company.</p>
      <p>Clealco, which filed for bankruptcy protection in July, said late on Monday that Amerra's bid of $47 million for its Queiroz mill, one of the three mills the company operates in Brazil, was not approved, at a meeting on Monday, by creditors who have a total debt estimated at around 1 billion reais ($238.03 million).</p>
      <p>Amerra, a fund specialized in distressed assets and high-yield financing, is also a creditor of Clealco, which is proposing in its in-court recovery plan to sell the Queiroz plant to pay back most creditors.</p>
      <p>Amerra already controls a sugar and ethanol plant in Brazil, the Naviraí mill in Mato Grosso do Sul state, which it acquired from Brazil's Infinity, a company that filed for bankruptcy protection in the troubled Brazilian sugar sector.</p>
      <p>A third bankruptcy case involving Amerra is linked to local grain trader Seara Agro, which is selling some assets such as port terminals and elevators as part of its recovery plan.</p>
      <p>Clealco said in a statement that creditors thought the bid did not value the Queiroz mill properly.</p>
      <p>More than 70 mills have gone under bankruptcy protection in Brazil in the last years, after a long period of low sugar and ethanol prices.</p>
