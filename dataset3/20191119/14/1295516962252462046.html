      <p>The CW has released the first photo of Kevin Conroy's Bruce Wayne for its upcoming Arrowverse crossover, "<a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/crisis-on-infinite-earths">Crisis on Infinite Earths</a>."</p>
      <p>The photo possibly gives away which Earth Conroy's Bruce Wayne calls home, as the character is wearing his exoskeleton from the <i>Kingdom Come</i> universe.</p>

      <p>The <a href="https://www.cbr.com/crisis-on-infinite-earths-kevin-conroy-bruce-wayne/">news of Conroy's addition</a> to "Crisis on Infinite Earths" broke in August at the 2019 Television Critics Association summer press tour, with reports stating he would play an older Bruce Wayne. In October, Conroy revealed he was <a href="https://www.cbr.com/kevin-conroy-beard-crisis-on-infinite-earths/">growing out a beard</a> while attending New York Comic-Con.</p>
      <p>Conroy posted a photo to his Twitter account alongside fellow actor Will Friedle. What made his NYCC appearance interesting is he was flown to New York from the "Crisis on Infinite Earths" Vancouver set, leading fans to wonder if he would also be sporting a beard for the Arrowverse blockbuster event.</p>
      <p>"Crisis on Infinite Earths" begins Sunday, Dec. 8 and 8 p.m. ET/PT on <i>Supergirl</i>, then continues in <i>Batwoman</i> on Monday, Dec. p at 8 p.m. ET/PT and in <i>The Flash</i> on Tuesday, Dec, 10 at 8 p.m. ET/PT. After the winter hiatus, the crossover will conclude on Tuesday, Jan. 14 in <i>Arrow</i> at 8 p.m. ET/PT and in <i>DC's Legends of Tomorrow</i> at 9 p.m. ET/PT.</p>
