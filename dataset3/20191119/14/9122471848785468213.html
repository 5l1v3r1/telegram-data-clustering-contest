      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T14:17:19+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 14:17</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Urban Meyer will be back on Ohio State’s campus on Saturday morning. The former Buckeyes’ head coach will be in Columbus for FOX’s <i>Big Noon Kickoff </i>show ahead of Ohio State’s game against Penn State.</p>
      <p>There will be two competing pregame shows at Ohio State on Saturday morning, as ESPN’s <i>College GameDay </i>will also be in town.</p>
      <p>Meyer and Co. are of course calling for fans to show up to his pregame show.</p>
      <p>“Love when dad comes back to the Shoe! Everyone meet me there! Outside the RPAC at 10am!” Meyer’s daughter, Gigi, tweeted on Monday night.</p>
