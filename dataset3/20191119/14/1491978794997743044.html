        <i>The ARP is proposing expulsion for members convicted of sexual violence, with 200 film-makers set to vote at a special meeting</i>
      </p>
      <p>A French organisation of more than 200 film-makers said on Monday it will propose new rules regarding members charged or convicted of a criminal offence, particularly of a sexual nature, which could lead to the suspension and expulsion of French-Polish director <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/romanpolanski">Roman Polanski</a>.</p>
      <p>The board of the ARP directors’ guild voted to present “new procedures to suspend any member facing legal charges, and expel any member convicted, especially for crimes of a sexual nature,” said Pierre Jolivet, the organisation’s president.</p>
      <p>The proposed rules for suspension “would affect Roman Polanski, whose judicial case is still open in the United States and for which he has been charged,” Jolivet added.</p>
      <p>The proposed changes will be presented to the directors’ guild members to vote on at a special general assembly, for which no date has yet been set, an ARP spokesman told Agence France-Presse (AFP).</p>
      <p>Polanski has been a fugitive from US justice since admitting to the statutory rape of a 13-year-old girl in 1977 in a plea bargain to avoid a trial on more serious charges. The 86-year-old film-maker was accused of drugging and raping the girl, and fled to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/france">France</a> when it appeared a judge was reconsidering his release.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/08/woman-accuses-roman-polanski-of-raping-her-in-1975-when-she-was-18">Earlier this month, former French model and actress Valentine Monnier</a> accused Polanski of raping her in 1975, when she was 18, after beating her “into submission” at his Swiss chalet. Monnier, who now works as a photographer, said she felt compelled to speak out after Polanski compared himself to the hero of his new film, Alfred Dreyfus, the Jewish officer wrongly persecuted as a spy by the French army at the turn of the 20th century. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/11/pressure-mounts-on-roman-polanski-over-new-sexual-assault-allegation">Polanski has denied Monnier’s claims</a> “in the strongest terms”.</p>
      <p>Despite the controversy swirling around Polanski and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/nov/13/paris-protest-disrupts-polanski-film-debut-over-accusations">calls to boycott his film,</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/30/an-officer-and-a-spy-review-roman-polanski-venice-film-festival">An Officer and a Spy</a> topped the box office in France this weekend, in one of the strongest openings for a French film this year.</p>
