      <p>The trial of a man accused of dangerous driving before <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/plymouth-news/man-crashed-car-vehicle-after-3551475">an accident in Mutley Plain has collapsed.</a></p>
      <p>A judge has discharged the jury in the case of Mark Hodge at Plymouth Crown Court.</p>
      <p>Hodge, of Radford Avenue, <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/all-about/princerock">Prince Rock</a>, went on trial yesterday after he denied driving an Audi A3 dangerously on August 6 last year.</p>
      <p>Prosecutors claim that the car was being driven at 60mph before hitting an oncoming vehicle.</p>
      <p>But Judge Paul Darlow discharged the jury for legal reasons.</p>
      <p>Hodge, aged 32, was released on bail until a new trial fixed for January 22.</p>
