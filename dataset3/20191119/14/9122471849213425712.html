      <h1>Star NFL WR Mocks ESPN Announcer Booger McFarland</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T14:44:41+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 14:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>ESPN’s <i>Monday Night Football </i>broadcasting team has received its fair share of criticism this season. Joe Tessitore and Booger McFarland are both good at what they do, but the pairing just doesn’t seem to click for big-time NFL games.</p>
      <p>Monday night, a couple of star NFL wide receivers appeared mock McFarland for what he said during the Chiefs-Chargers game.</p>
      <p>“Games in this league are lost more than they’re won,” McFarland said on Monday night.</p>
      <p>Packers wide receiver Davante Adams didn’t appear to respect that comment. It does have a Trent Dilfer “you can’t lose games and still win” vibe.</p>

      <p>Minnesota Vikings wideout Stefon Diggs didn’t seem to like it, either.</p>

      <p>The Chiefs ended up winning Monday night’s game, 24-17.</p>
