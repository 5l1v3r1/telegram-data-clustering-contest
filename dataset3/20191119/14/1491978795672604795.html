      <h1>Chelsea set for transfer window appeal but will be kept waiting for ruling</h1>

        <i>• Cas likely to announce in December whether ban is overturned <br/>• Leicester’s Ben Chilwell among targets when signings possible</i>
      </p>
      <p>Chelsea are unlikely to hear until December whether their <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/22/chelsea-transfer-ban-two-windows-fifa-foreign-players-under-age-18">two-window transfer ban</a> will be overturned by the court of arbitration for sport, which is set to hear the case on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The club are unable to make signings until February 2020 after they were found guilty by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/fifa">Fifa</a> of breaking transfer regulations relating to minors. They were also fined £460,000 and failed to overturn the decision when presenting their case to Fifa’s appeals committee in April.</p>
      <p>Chelsea have taken the case to CAS and their hopes of making signings in January rest on winning their appeal. However, there will not be an immediate ruling on the case. Although the hearing concludes on Wednesday, the arbiters will deliberate and then prepare an award containing their decision. It is likely a decision will be announced in December. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/chelsea">Chelsea</a> declined to comment on the appeal.</p>
      <p>Fifa published a judgment this month, saying Chelsea were given a transfer ban following 150 rule breaches involving 69 academy players over several seasons. Chelsea were thus unable to make any signings last summer.</p>
      <p>Frank Lampard <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/nov/04/chelsea-20-november-hearing-appeal-fifa-transfer-ban">has indicated that he would look to strengthen in January </a>if the ban is overturned. Chelsea’s manager is in the market for a left-back and is interested in Leicester’s Ben Chilwell as a potential replacement for Marcos Alonso. However, they face competition for the England international from Manchester City.</p>
      <p>If Lampard is able to make signings he could allow Olivier Giroud to leave. The striker is out of favour and has been targeted by Internazionale.</p>
