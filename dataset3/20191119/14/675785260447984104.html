      <h2>Khabib Nurmagomedov choked out Conor McGregor in the fourth round last year of their UFC fight in Las Vegas to put a decisive end to their bitter rivalry</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T14:34:50+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 14:34</time> by <a rel="author">Martin Domin, https://www.facebook.com/mirrorfighting</a></address>
      <p>Khabib Nurmagomedov has claimed he knew Conor McGregor wanted out of their fight as soon as they stepped into the cage.</p>
      <p>The bitter rivals clashed last October with Nurmagomedov choking out the Irishman in the fourth round to defend his UFC lightweight title.</p>
      <p>The pair were then embroiled in a post-fight brawl which saw them both banned as their feud escalated.</p>
      <p>Nurmagomedov returned to action in September when he choked out Dustin Poirier while McGregor is expected to resume his career against Donald Cerrone on January 18 in Las Vegas.</p>

      <p>The former two-weight champion wants a rematch with Nurmagomedov in the future, but the 155lb champion believes McGregor did not want to fight last time.</p>
      <p>“Before the fight, when the referee stood between us giving us instructions, the opponent didn’t look at me in the eyes,” he said.</p>
      <p>"At that moment, I realised he didn’t want to be in the cage with me. And before that, he talked a lot.</p>
      <p>“He looked at me and made statements. But when we were in the cage, I realised he wanted it to be over as soon as possible.”</p>

      <p>Nurmagomedov has also claimed he hadn't enjoyed beating his opponents - until he faced McGregor.</p>
      <p>“I had fights in my career where I understood that I could hurt my opponent more, but I’d talk to him, tell him to give up so that I don’t beat him too hard," he said.</p>
      <p>“For example, if I had a painful hold where I could break something, I wouldn’t tighten it all the way, it’d just fix it so that the opponent would tap out.</p>
      <p>“Because I have no aim to hurt anyone in this sport. Yes, we compete in a very brutal combat sport, but it’s never my goal to inflict a lot of pain on my opponent.</p>

      <p>“If I understand that I’m winning, I don’t aim to hurt someone bad. Well, except for one fight.”</p>
      <p>McGregor's return to the Octagon, meanwhile, is expected to be confirmed in the coming weeks.</p>
      <p>His manager Audie Attar said: “I would say that talks have been progressing. We’ve met them, we’re in close communication with them.</p>
      <p>"I would hope that an announcement could happen in the coming weeks, but at the end of the day, it’s still a work in progress.</p>
      <p>"He strives for greatness and dreams for things that nobody thought that he could accomplish, and he’s doing that again.</p>
      <p>“At the end of the day, that’s the thing people forgot about him; he actually is a competitor. He dares to do things differently.</p>
      <p>"That’s what’s exciting. It’s exciting to be a part of that and witness that and see that fire in him again. I love it.”</p>
