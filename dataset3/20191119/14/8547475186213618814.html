        <b>The Labour Party plan to take urgent action to remove dangerous cladding from tower blocks across the country in order to prevent another Grenfell tragedy.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Shadow Housing Secretary John Healey travelled to Bolton to announce Labour's proposal to tackle the "national emergency" of hazardous cladding on high-rise buildings.</p>
      <p>The shadow cabinet member visited <a href="https://www.lbc.co.uk/uk-news/fire-rips-through-block-of-student-flats-in-bolton/">the site of last Friday's tower block fire in Bolton</a>, claiming that complacency under the Conservative government was putting lives at risk.</p>
      <p>He said: "It is shameful that, over two years since the horror of the Grenfell Tower fire, people are still living in tower blocks with flammable cladding.</p>
      <p>"The Conservativesâ€™ complacency is putting lives at risk, and the fire in Bolton must be a wake-up call.</p>
      <p>"Labour will treat the removal of unsafe cladding as a national emergency and deliver real change for the thousands of people still living in homes with deadly cladding."</p>

      <p>Official figures published last week suggest the government will miss targets for removing Grenfell-style cladding from such buildings by more than a decade.</p>
      <p>Nine in 10 private blocks have not had the material removed, therefore Jeremy Corbyn's party have promised to fast-track its replacement.</p>
      <p>A Labour government would seek to ensure block-owners prove they are making efforts to remove the material by the end of December, a party statement revealed.</p>
      <p>Failure to do so will result in councils being allowed to take over the buildings to ensure the necessary work is completed to make them safe.</p>
      <p>Offending blocks will be named and shamed under Labour's "five point plan" and funding would be made immediately available for councils who take them over.</p>

      <p>Of the 267 high-rises yet to remove their hazardous cladding, almost 70 of them still have no plan in place to do so.</p>
      <p>Boris Johnson visited the scene of the Bolton fire on Saturday afternoon and briefly met students who had been evacuated.</p>
      <p>He called the response to the blaze "incredible" after the community used social media to help students affected by the inferno.</p>
      <p>Two people were injured after the fire at The Cube in Greater Manchester, including one person rescued by crews via an aerial platform.</p>
      <p>Images posted on social media showed firefighters tackling the blaze on the top floors of a six-storey building on Bradshawgate at around 8.30pm on Friday.</p>
      <p>The Liberal Democrats have also criticised the Tory government for failing to act swiftly in replacing the material from high-rises across the country.</p>
      <p>Jo Swinson's party urged ministers to meet "basic promises" and go further by funding the private sector.</p>
