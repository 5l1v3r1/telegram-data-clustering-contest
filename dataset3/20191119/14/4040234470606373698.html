      <p>Security vulnerabilities in personal voice assistant technology would have made it possible for hackers to take photos and videos of users, or track their location without a victims’ knowledge, according to new findings.</p>
      <p>Flaws in several Android devices opened holes in the Google Assistant and Samsung’s Bixby, according to <a href="https://www.checkmarx.com/blog/how-attackers-could-hijack-your-android-camera">research published</a> Tuesday by the Israeli security vendor Checkmarx. The issues in Google’s Pixel brand of phones and Samsung’s Galaxy series could have allowed outsiders to record two-way conversations, silence the shutter on a phone’s camera and collect GPS location based on a device’s metadata.</p>
      <p>Both Google and Samsung say the patch has been available since July in the Play Store.</p>
      <p>The vulnerabilities show that as new technologies promise more convenience, they can also <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/tag/iot/">create new channels</a> that attackers can leverage to infiltrate unwitting users’ devices, or access their information. Researchers <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/ring-doorbell-wi-fi-flaw/">proved earlier this month</a> they could intercept Wi-Fi usernames and passwords from customers who installed Amazon’s Ring doorbells on their homes.</p>
      <p>In this case, Checkmarx researchers determined Samsung’s Bixby and the <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/tag/google/">Google</a> Assistant could carry out these tasks because, as voice assistants, they don’t need to ask for permission to capture images or record video. But a hole in the programs made it possible for other, less-trusted apps to abuse the assistants. A seemingly innocuous app could pretend to send a voice request to the Google Assistant or <a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/tag/samsung/">Samsung</a> Bixby asking to capture images, then start filming without any obvious notification to the device owner.</p>
      <p>Researchers developed a proof-of-concept weather application to ask the voice assistants for that access. They did not point to any examples of hackers carrying out this attack in the real world.</p>
      <p>“The malicious app we designed for the demonstration was nothing more than a mockup weather app that could have been malicious by design,” the researchers explained. “When the client starts the app, it essentially creates a persistent connection back to the [command and control] server and waits for commands and instructions from the attacker, who is operating the C&amp;C server from anywhere in the world. Even closing the app does not terminate the persistent connection.”</p>
