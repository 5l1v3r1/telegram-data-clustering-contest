      <h2>He set the record straight on This Morning</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T14:07:57+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 14:07</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Bell</a></address>
      <p>John Barrowman has appeared on <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/daytime-tv/this-morning/">This Morning</a> to chat about this year's <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/">I'm A Celebrity</a> and address fans' concerns over his dramatically different new look.</p>
      <p>The former campmate, 52, stunned viewers when he featured on the first episode of spin-off show Extra Camp and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celebrity-extra-camp-viewers-divided-over-john-barrowmans-drastic-new-look/">had short grey hair</a> instead of his usual darker style.</p>
      <p>Rumours arose that he might be ill, but he took the opportunity to set the record straight during a chat with This Morning hosts <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/phillip-schofield/">Phillip Schofield</a> and <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/holly-willoughby/">Holly Willoughby</a>.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Appearing on the daytime show via video link with his pal Allison Hammond today (19.11.19), John spoke about the series so far and what's in store over the coming weeks.</p>
      <p>At the end of the interview, Phil said: "And we can't let you go without... John Barrowman, great hair!</p>
      <p>"Thank you! I thought you would like it. Yeah, there's been stuff in the papers saying that something's happened, I'm ill, there's something wrong."</p>

      <p>John explained that he's completely fine and said he simply wanted to have his natural hair moving forward.</p>
      <p>He continued: "The fact of the matter is, I just don't want to dye my hair any more. I wanted to cut it, I wanted it natural and thank you for liking it, Phillip."</p>
      <p>Schofe admitted: "It looks great."</p>
      <aside>I just don't want to dye my hair any more.</aside>
      <p>And Holly told him: "You look handsome as ever."</p>
      <p>Phil then added: "Dying it is an absolute pain in the neck. I did that for years."</p>
      <p>John then had the studio in hysterics by taking a handful of Alison's dark, curly hair and holding it over his own head.</p>

      <p>Extra Camp viewers were somewhat divided over John's new look when he debuted it over the weekend (17.11.19).</p>
      <p>After <a href="https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/entertainment/im-a-celebrity/im-a-celebrity-fans-dont-like-emily-atacks-new-hair/">fans reacted to Extra Camp host Emily Atack's new brunette locks</a>, John arrived on the show high kicking and screaming his "fabulous!" catchphrase.</p>
      <p>But his drastic new hair appeared to be the only thing on viewers' minds.</p>
