      <h1>Subaru Levorg V-Sport is basically a WRX STI wagon</h1>
      <h2>2020 Subaru Levorg V-Sport is more powerful than the WRX</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T14:44:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 14:44</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.autoindustriya.com/author/marcus-deguzman.html" target="_blank">Marcus De Guzman</a></address>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.autoindustriya.com/car-reviews/2020-subaru-wrx-sti.html">current WRX STI</a> is not long for this world after Subaru released the <a href="https://www.autoindustriya.com/auto-industry-news/end-of-an-era-subaru-wrx-sti-ej20-final-edition-revealed.html">Final Edition</a> three months ago. As it is set to be consigned to the history books, it might be awhile before Subaru releases an all-new WRX STI.</p>
      <p>With the high-performance four-door riding off into the sunset, Subaru has cooked up something special in the form of a special edition Levorg. But unlike the standard <a href="https://www.autoindustriya.com/car-reviews/2019-subaru-levorg-2-0-gt-s-eyesight.html">2.0-liter turbo wagon</a> which already makes an impressive 268 PS and 350 Nm of torque, Subaru's latest creation has 300 PS with 400 Nm of torque which is similar to the WRX STI.</p>

      <p>Say hello to the 2020 Levorg V-Sport, a Japan-only special that gets a beefed-up turbocharged boxer engine, among other things. Compared to a standard Levorg, the exterior of the V-Sport is decorated with blacked-out trim pieces. From the side mirrors, Levorg badging, foglight bezels, as well as the 18-inch alloy wheels, Subaru generously used the black paint to give the V-Sport a meaner look.</p>
      <p>Neat touches of glossy piano black trim also make their way inside the Levorg V-Sport, replacing most of the shiny bits. Other than that, the interior relatively remains the same. That means it gets bucket-style front seats, leather upholstery with contrast stitching, a flat-bottomed steering wheel, as well as steering wheel-mounted paddle shifters.</p>

      <p>As mentioned earlier, this particular wagon is powered by a boosted 2.0-liter turbocharged boxer engine. It cranks out 300 PS at 5600 rpm while peak torque of 400 Nm is available at 2000 â€“ 4800 rpm. Sorry manual fans, the Levorg V-Sport is only mated to a CVT with Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive.</p>
      <p>Besides having a more powerful engine, Subaru also gave the special edition model several chassis and safety upgrades. The front suspension gets Bilsetin dampers, along with more powerful 2-piston brake calipers to better shave off speed. In addition, EyeSight is fitted as standard for a safer driving experience.</p>

      <p>Will Subaru be offering the Levorg V-Sport outside of Japan? Your guess is as good as mine.</p>
