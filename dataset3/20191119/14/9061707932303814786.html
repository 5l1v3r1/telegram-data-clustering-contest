      <h1>History lesson that points to serious concern for Derby County's top-six hopes</h1>
      <h2>The Rams have collected 21 points from a possible 48 in the Championship so far this season</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T14:47:02+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 14:47</time> by <a rel="author">Steve Nicholson</a></address>
      <p>Derby County will need to up their current points' return rate if they are to finish in the top six this season.</p>
      <p>That is clear from the Championship table and from Derby's tally of 21 points from a possible 48.</p>
      <p>Only twice in the past 10 seasons have <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county">Derby</a> had fewer points at this stage.</p>
      <p>They had 20 points in 2016-17, and finished ninth. They had 17 points in 2009-10, and finished 14th.</p>
      <p>Closer scrutiny of Derby's current stats, however, show how <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/derby-county-phillip-cocu-feyenoord-3549224">Phillip Cocu's</a> team will have to buck a trend if the season is to extend into the play-offs.</p>
      <p>Only three teams in the past 10 seasons have secured a top-six finish from a position of 21 points or fewer after 16 matches.</p>
      <p>Aston Villa, conquerors of Derby in last season's play-off final, had 21 points at this stage and yet they went on to finish fifth on 76.</p>
      <p>They were helped, of course, by a run of 10 consecutive wins.</p>
      <p>Villa's 4-0 thumping of Derby at the beginning of March sparked the run, and Dean Smith's team showcased a perfect example of hitting form at just the right time and going into the play-offs with momentum.</p>

      <p>The previous season, 2017-18, Fulham had 19 points from 16 games - two fewer than Derby's current tally - and yet they rallied to finish third on 88 points. They went on to beat Villa in the play-off final and win promotion.</p>
      <p>Reading are the only other team in the past 10 seasons to finish in the top six from 21 points or less at this stage. They had 21 in 2009-10 - and finished as champions on 89!</p>
      <p>Derby have so far this season collected 44% of the points on offer.</p>
      <p>The figure is significantly lower than the percentage they collected on each of the four occasions they finished in the top six in the past six seasons.</p>
      <p>Last season, they finished sixth on 74 points (54%). In 2017-18, they also gathered 54% of the points available to finish sixth, while the figure was 57% (78 points) in 2015-16.</p>
      <p>Derby finished third on 85 points in 2013-14 - a points return of 62%.</p>
      <p>
