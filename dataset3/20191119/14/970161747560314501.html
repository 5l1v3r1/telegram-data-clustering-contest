      <p>Diane Abbott has been criticised for meeting an anti-LGBT education activist who joined ‘homophobic’ protests outside a school in Birmingham.</p>
      <p>The Shadow Home Secretary posed for a photo with Shraga Stern and other community leaders after meeting them to ‘discuss local matters’ in her north London constituency.</p>
      <p>Mr Stern has been described as a ‘divisive’ Charedi activist who campaigned to exclude religious schools from having to teach LGBT issues as part of the government’s relationships and sex education policy.</p>
      <p>It provoked outrage in the Jewish community and Mr Stern was told to stop campaigning by senior rabbis in Stamford Hill – which is home to the largest Hasidic community in Europe, and forms part of Ms Abbott’s safe Labour seat of Hackney North and Stoke Newington.</p>
      <p>Jewish Labour campaigners said Ms Abbott’s decision to openly meet Mr Stern will ‘alienate many in the LGBT community’ and LGBT Jews.</p>

      <p>After the meeting last night, Ms Abbott shared the photo of herself with Rabbi Herschel Gluck, Cllr Anntoinette Bramble, and Mr Stern, tweeting: ‘Pleased to meet with Hackney deputy mayor Antoinette Bramble and community leaders to discuss local matters.’</p>
      <p>But she was soon slammed for calling Mr Stern a ‘community leader’.</p>

      <p>One person wrote: ‘If he is a community leader, you are a Rabbi!’</p>
      <p>National organiser for the Jewish Labour Movement (JLM) Rebecca Filer asked: ‘Why is Diane Abbott openly meeting with Shraga Stern who’s been leading a homophobic campaign against Relationships and Sex Education in schools?’</p>
      <p>A JLM spokesperson told Metro.co.uk: ‘Shraga Stern may be one of Diane Abbott’s constituents, however Stern has been a divisive campaigner against LGBT+ inclusive sex and relationships education.</p>
      <p>‘Meeting with Stern openly will serve to alienate many in the LGBT+ community, especially LGBT+ Jews.’</p>
      <p>Jeremy Corbyn was also criticised earlier this year when he was seen meeting Mr Stern in Westminster.</p>
      <p>He was called out by former Labour MP Margaret Hodge who took a picture of the meeting in Portcullis House.</p>

      <p>Ms Hodge tweeted: ‘Having lunch &amp; wondering why Corbyn wants to be seen talking to an anti-LGBT activist who doesn’t represent the mainstream Jewish community yet chooses to sideline groups like @JewishLabour.’</p>
      <p>At the time, Mr Stern told the <a href="https://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/jeremy-corbyn-condemned-for-meeting-anti-lgbt-charedi-activist-shraga-stern-1.486579">Jewish Chronicle</a> that he is ‘not a homophobe’ and his campaign was ‘nothing to do with LGBT teaching’, but about continuing the ‘Charedi tradition’ of parents teaching sex education at home.</p>

      <p>However, in a video filmed outside Parkfield School in March, Mr Stern talked about the ‘problem of indoctrination and sexualising kids’ and how ‘LGBT lobbies’ have entered the education system.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘We parents must stand up for our rights. We must fight for our freedom of religion and freedom to educate the children the way we were educated.’</p>
