      <p>CALDWELL COUNTY, N.C. (WBTV) - A woman was arrested after deputies say she went to a 14-year-old sex crime victim’s home with a baseball bat and threatened him.</p>
      <p>Ozaya Elizabeth Cole, 20, is charged with intimidating a state witness. Officials say Cole is friends with Lisa Marie Hendren, a Caldwell County woman who was arrested on Nov. 9 and accused of statutory sex offense with the teenager.</p>

      <p>Deputies say two days after Hendren’s arrest, Cole and three men went to the 14-year-old’s home with baseball bats in hand and stood in the road. They say Cole then yelled out that the teen would not make it to court.</p>
      <p>Since Cole was the only one in the group to make a verbal threat, she was the only one arrested.</p>
      <p>There is no word on whether Cole was granted bond. Hendren was given a $50,000 bond after her arrest.</p>
