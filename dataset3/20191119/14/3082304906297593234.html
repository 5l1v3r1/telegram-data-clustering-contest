        <b>Kingsley Coman suffered a muscle injury on France duty but was back running at Bayern Munich’s training ground on Tuesday.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Kingsley Coman was back running at Bayern Munich’s training ground after leaving the France squad early with a muscle problem.</p>
      <p>Coman was forced off in the 88th minute of France’s 2-1 Euro 2020 qualifying victory over Moldova on Thursday. He was sent home early by France, meaning he missed Sunday’s 2-0 away win in Albania.</p>
      <p>An examination by Bayern’s chief medical officer Dr. Hans Muller-Wohlfahrt revealed a muscle hardening in his thigh.</p>
      <p>Bayern said the former Paris Saint-Germain and Juventus forward would undertake a reduced training programme following the injury but he appeared to making progress at the club’s Saebener Strasse training ground on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The defending Bundesliga champions are third in the table, four points adrift of leaders Borussia Monchengladbach.</p>
      <p>Bayern visit Fortuna Dusseldorf on Saturday, before travelling to Serbia to face Red Star Belgrade in the Champions League.</p>
