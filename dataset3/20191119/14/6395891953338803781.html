      <p><b>BAGHDADÂ (AP)</b> - Anti-government protesters are blocking access to another major commercial port in southern Iraq.</p>
      <p>An Associated Press journalist saw at least a dozen protesters blocking the main entrance to Khor al-Zubair port on Tuesday, halting trade activity. The port is Iraq's second largest.</p>
      <p>Protesters burned tires, cutting access to main roads leading to Iraq's main Gulf port Umm Qasr on Monday.</p>
      <p>Iraqi civilians say they are relying on boats to take them across the Tigris River after ongoing protests shut down the Jumhuriya, Sinak and Ahrar bridges connecting east and west Baghdad.</p>
      <p>Hassan Lilo, a boat owner in the capital says: "The blockage of the bridge causes harm to people and prevents them from going to work," adding, "So they come here to use the boats and we help them cross to the other side."</p>
