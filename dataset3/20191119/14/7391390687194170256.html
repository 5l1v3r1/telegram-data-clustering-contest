      <p>There are few acts more soothing in their simplicity than <a href="https://www.bookbub.com/blog/gift-wrap-books-for-christmas-ideas">wrapping a book</a> if you're giving one as a gift: the sleek slide of scissors through glossy paper, the brisk fold-over, the symmetrical double tuck, the setting of tape. And when it comes to determining the best recipient of a gifted new book, I think we can all agree: It's none other than yourself. Which is why, if you aren't already looking ahead to the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/list/tag/2020">new books coming out in 2020</a> that are guaranteed to be must-reads, you should be.</p>
      <p>When it comes to buying books, I have only one recommendation to make. <i>Be selfish.</i> Buy a really good book and <a href="https://www.bustle.com/p/15-believable-excuses-for-when-you-agreed-to-plans-but-you-really-just-want-to-stay-home-read-70815">cancel your plans to read it</a>. Tell your date you have to leave early so you can finish that last chapter. Take it to the coffee shop and spill your chai latte all over it because you're flipping pages too quickly.</p>
      <p>Ahead, I've compiled the 20 best books the early months of 2020 have to offer — the gilded, the soon-to-be lauded, the <i>highly anticipated. </i>Consider these picks an excuse to treat yourself with a good read even after the official holiday season is over.</p>
      <h3>Most Likely To Get You Triple-Digit Likes On Instagram: Godshot by Chelsea Bieker</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Post this one to the feed: It’s flashy. It’s gold. It’s about cults.</p>
      <h3>Most Likely To Give You Major Sally Rooney Vibes: Topics of Conversation by Miranda Popkey</h3>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2019/11/14/cf114fe3-a6be-4411-bb52-228ecf3b5fa4-topics.jpe?w=646&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=70"/>
      </figure>
      <p>It's more <i>Conversations with Friends </i>than <i>Normal People, </i>but Miranda Popkey will definitely be a hit with readers who love Sally Rooney.</p>
      <h3>Most Likely To Be A Reese Witherspoon Book Club Pick: Such A Fun Age by Kiley Reid</h3>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>It's smart, wry, plot-driven, and all about how earnest white people so often get race <i>majorly</i> wrong. Reese Witherspoon, you there? This one is begging for a book club burst on its cover — and an adaptation.</p>
      <h3>Most Likely To Result In You Making An Unattractive Noise In Public: Wow, No Thank You. by Samantha Irby</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>You'll rant. You'll rage. You'll use the red-with-anger-and-cussing emoji one too many times while talking with your friends about the relationship at the center of this book: One between a teacher and his underage student.</p>

      <p>This epic about one woman's journey across Mexico and into the United States is an eye-opening account of the unfathomable, brutal violences experienced by those who dare to dream of better and immigrate to the United States. It made me cry — and donate money to organizations helping immigrants in the United States.</p>
