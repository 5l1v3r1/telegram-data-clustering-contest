      <p>A toaster oven combines the best qualities of microwaves and standard ovens — speed and the capability to crisp and brown food — while still fitting on your countertop. Most boast several standard-oven-like functions while heating more efficiently for small-scale cooking. Here's what you need to know to help you choose the <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/toaster-ovens/best-toaster-ovens-from-consumer-reports-tests/">best rated toaster oven</a>.</p>
      <p>To consider capacity, think in terms of slices of toast. Larger options can hold as many as nine slices of bread, or a 13-inch pizza, or a whole 5-pound chicken. Smaller ovens can hold two, four, or six slices of toast. Looking to preserve counter space? A compact pick can also get the job done as some have enough space to cook a 9-inch personal pizza.</p>
      <p>More powerful toaster ovens will have <a href="https://www.jameco.com/Jameco/content/high-wattage-power-supply-selection.html">greater maximum wattage</a>, which tends to come with a higher temperature range up to 500 degrees Fahrenheit. <a href="https://www.ahs.com/home-matters/quick-tips/make-the-most-of-your-toaster-oven">Conventional toaster ovens</a> are heated by an element (like standard ovens) while a <a href="https://www.thekitchn.com/what-is-a-convection-oven-and-111563">convection oven has a fan for quickly and evenly</a> cooking food. <a href="https://www.infraredheatergenie.com/how-does-an-infrared-oven-work/">Infrared toaster ovens</a> similarly heat quickly, but tend to be more expensive when you take capacity into account. For true cooking rather than just reheating, choose convection or infrared for evener heat distribution.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.realsimple.com/reviews/best-toaster-oven-buying-guide">Oven safety features</a>, like automatic shut-off, drip trays, and racks that automatically extend when the door is opened, may be important for you to consider depending on your household.</p>
      <p>Keep scrolling to shop for the <a href="https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/appliances/g251/best-toaster-ovens/">best toaster oven</a> for your kitchen; some go far beyond baking and toasting.</p>

Highly recommend!”</p>

      <p>A little bit smaller than our space-saving pick at 13.9 by 10.3 by 7.8 inches, this <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GMDX1WI/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=bustle-20&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B00GMDX1WI&amp;linkId=a80b4efd64e9b2d18d55787aab259b0d">infrared toaster oven</a> is highly rated with more than 2,000 reviews, but it's also the best compact toaster oven.

      <p>The interior fits four slices of bread or a 9-inch pizza, and it has six presets: toast, quick reheat, frozen pizza, frozen waffles, frozen hashbrowns, and reheat rolls.

The compact design is available in black, silver, or white and reviewers repeatedly note this oven's small footprint, and its rapid heating has been enough to totally change the way some shoppers cook.</p>
      <p><b>Fans say</b>: “This is the best toaster oven I've ever owned. Period. And over the course of 30 years I've owned just about every imaginable kind of toaster oven - and toaster oven combo (usually with convection feature). As I've gotten older I've really gravitated toward the pricey ones that aren't "just" a toaster...One other thing? It's a slightly different shape than a traditional toaster over -- square shaped instead of long and boxy. The shape seems more logical for some reason, fits much better on our counter, and the toast seems easier to get to.”</p>
