      <p>TK Kirkland shared his thoughts on the former head of Death Row security, Reggie Wright Jr.,  being sentenced to 1.5 years in prison for selling marijuana. TK pointed out that 1.5 years is a lot of time when you're in your 50's, but TK agreed with DJ Vlad about hoping that Reggie makes the most of his time in prison for personal betterment. TK also spoke about plans to drop his new comedy special next year, which he hopes to release the same day as Eddie Murphy's stand-up special for some "friendly competition." To hear more, including TK big up DJ Vlad for the success story of VladTV, hit the above clip. </p>
