      <p>Penticton will play host to a unique new race next spring, with organizers hoping to build the event into a world-class destination.</p>
      <p>Hoodoo Adventures will be bringing “<a href="https://www.expeditionracecanada.ca/">Expedition Canada</a>” to the community on June 2, 2020 — a 2-4 day “adventure race” where teams of four travel 380 kilometres guided with only a map and compass. </p>
      <p>The racers will primarily hike, mountain bike and paddle but segments could including rock climbing/rappelling.</p>
      <p>Lyndie Hill of Hoodoo Adventures and racer Nathalie Long were before council Tuesday to fill the city in on their plans.</p>
      <p>After an initial demo race in 2020, the event will be the first its kind in Canada to become a qualifier for the World Championship of Adventure Racing, which should draw athletes from all over the world.</p>
      <p>“It’s a bigger picture thing, not just about the race,” Hill said, explaining they wanted to come up with something to draw people to the city in the shoulder season.</p>
      <p>The race will start in Penticton and end in a remote location outside the city. The top teams are expected to finish in just two days, but the course would stay open for four days for more casual entrants. Entrance fees are $4,600 per team before Dec. 15.</p>
