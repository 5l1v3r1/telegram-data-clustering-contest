      <h1>'Fighting' - Nottingham Forest skipper Michael Dawson on the battle ahead</h1>
      <h2>Reds defender is back from injury but is taking nothing for granted</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-19T14:58:00+00:00">19 Nov 2019, 14:58</time> by <a rel="author">Sarah Clapson</a></address>
      <p>Skipper <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/michael-dawson">Michael Dawson</a> jokes he has had to be “held back”, so keen is he to get back out on the pitch for Nottingham Forest.</p>
      <p>But the defender knows there are no guarantees he will walk straight into Sabri Lamouchi’s line-up after recovering from a calf problem.</p>
      <p>Dawson had started each of the Reds’ opening nine league games of the season before being forced off <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-player-ratings-stoke-3370516">in the 3-2 victory over Stoke City</a> at the end of September.</p>
      <p>Since then, he has watched on as Forest have maintained their push towards the top of the Championship table, with summer signing Chema and Tobias Figueiredo fighting it out to partner Joe Worrall in defence.</p>
      <p>“I’m fully fit again,” said Dawson, who was restricted to just 13 appearances last term due to injury problems. “But the lads have been fantastic.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been back training and we were very cautious with the injury.</p>
      <p>“The manager was fantastic and the medical staff were great - they were holding me back a little bit! I was wanting to get back out there!</p>
      <p>“But as you get older, things take a little bit longer. With what happened last year, we didn’t want it to happen again.”</p>
      <p>“I had a good run at the start and started all nine games,” he added. <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-player-ratings-season-3532587">“You just want to keep that run going.</a></p>

      <p>“You get your fitness in pre-season and get to a certain level.</p>
      <p>“We’re athletes and sometimes when you’re training every day and you’re playing, you take your fitness for granted.</p>
      <p>“When you’re out for a few weeks, to get to that level again, it takes time. And to get back to where you were playing, it takes time.</p>
      <p>“We’re going to have had a good two weeks training (during the international break) and <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/bristol-city-qpr-nottingham-forest-3551517">we’ll go to Bristol City</a> with players coming back fighting for the shirt.</p>
      <p>“The lads who played well in the last two games have had two wins.”</p>
      <p>The club captain was available for selection just before the international break, for the clash with arch-rivals Derby County, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/sabri-lamouchi-reveals-michael-dawson-3520798">but was not risked by Lamouchi.</a></p>
      <p>Dawson was, though, in and around the squad as Forest made it back-to-back wins against the Rams.</p>
      <p>“We knew the game, we knew how the lads were playing - and they got a fantastic result,” the 36-year-old said of <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/match-reports/nottinham-forest-derby-county-analysis-3521884">the 1-0 City Ground win.</a></p>
      <p>“I travelled with the lads to the hotel beforehand and it was great to be in and around it.</p>
      <p>“I’ll always do whatever I can to help the lads.</p>

      <p>“But they’re experienced players, they don’t need someone like me to tell them what to do. They’ll just keep performing and the manager will keep leading us like he is.</p>
      <p>“We lost two games (after the last break) but we kept calm and knew the quality would come through.</p>
      <p>“We’re going to lose games. It’s going to happen again. But we’ve shown a determination to bounce back, like we did at Luton.</p>
      <p>“That was a tough place to go, but we got a hard-fought win. And then the game against Derby was great.</p>
      <p>“That’s great, when you can enjoy going into a break after a win. Then you come back and train and look to get off to a good start.</p>
      <p>“We’ve got a busy period now until the next break in March. But that’s football and you have to keep going.</p>
      <p>“We’ll need everyone, like we have so far this season already.”</p>
      <p>And Dawson is ready to fight for his place in the first XI as <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Lamouchi’s men</a> prepare to return to action against the Robins this weekend.</p>

      <p>“You’ve got to fight a lot harder to come back as you get older,” he said.</p>
      <p>“And it gives someone else the opportunity to take your shirt. I appreciate that.</p>
      <p>“I got my opportunity in the Premier League through people being injured. It happens.</p>
      <p>“When people take it, good luck to them.</p>
      <p>“You have to work even harder on the training ground to try to get that shirt back.</p>
      <p>“If the lads keep winning, you have to keep breathing down their necks and striving to get it back.</p>
      <p>“We need competition, because we need to keep winning if we’re going to go where we want to go.”</p>
