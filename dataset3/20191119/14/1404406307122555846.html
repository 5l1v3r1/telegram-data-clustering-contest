      <p>TMZ Sports recently caught up with Migos rapper Quavo to ask his thoughts on the Atlanta Falcons having a 3-7 record so far this season, and he offered up some advice on fixing the situation. Quavo stated, "We need to get Matt Ryan out of there! I love Colin [Kaepernick]. He should be on a team...The Atlanta Falcons."</p>
      <p>This comes after Kaepernick's <a href="https://www.vladtv.com/article/259022/colin-kaepernick-tells-nfl-stop-running-from-the-truth-after-workout">highly publicized NFL workout</a> over the weekend in Atlanta. Despite being held in the Falcons' city, no one from the team attended the workout, which was switched from the Falcons' training facility to a local high school. Per ESPN's Adam Schefter, the teams who attended were the Chiefs, Jets, Eagles, Titans, Bills, 49ers, Redskins, and Lions.</p>
