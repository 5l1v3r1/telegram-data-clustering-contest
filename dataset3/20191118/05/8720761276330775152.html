      <h1>John Legere To Step Down As T-Mobile CEO Next Year</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T05:30:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 05:30</time> by <a rel="author">BeauHD</a></address>
      <p>T-Mobile President and COO Mike Sievert <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/18/mike-sievert-to-succeed-john-legere-as-ceo-of-t-mobile-on-may-1-2020.html">will succeed John Legere as CEO on May 1, 2020</a>, the company <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20191118005368/en/">announced</a> Monday. CNBC reports: <i>Sievert has been the heir apparent as Legere was expected to step down as CEO once T-Mobile's merger with Sprint is completed. Legere's contract ends on April 30, 2020, according to the announcement. Leger <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnLegere/status/1196421210839453698?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2019%2F11%2F18%2Fmike-sievert-to-succeed-john-legere-as-ceo-of-t-mobile-on-may-1-2020.html">tweeted</a> Monday that the decision "has been under development for a long time." When T-Mobile and Sprint first announced their intention to merge in April 2018, the companies said Legere would lead the combined business as CEO, with Sievert continuing to serve as President and COO. <br/><br/>Legere's next move is still not known. CNBC and The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://it.slashdot.org/story/19/11/11/2136204/wework-in-talks-to-hire-t-mobile-ceo-john-legere">reported last week</a> that WeWork had spoken to him about taking over as CEO following Adam Neumann's ouster. But CNBC later reported that Legere is not taking the job, according to people familiar with the matter. On a conference call Monday, Legere denied that he was ever in talks to be the WeWork CEO.</i></p>
