          <p>At club level. Cristiano Ronaldo is perhaps in the leanest run of his career. However, when it comes to international matches there is no stopping the Portuguese torpedo. Cristiano Ronaldo is now just one goal away from being the 2<sup>nd</sup> man to hit 100 international goals.</p>

                      <h3>Fans accuse Cristiano Ronaldo of stealing Diogo Jota’s goal during Portugal vs Luxembourg</h3>
                      <p>Manchester City’s Bernardo Silva crossed the ball to Diogo Jota who controlled the ball before attempting to put it past the keeper. The goalkeeper made a mess of the ball and it slipped past him but fell inches outside the goal.The ball however, was still on its way in before Ronaldo tapped it in to leave no doubt. Ronaldo was now just one away from the magical three figures and had scored 14<sup>th</sup> international goal, his highest in a calendar year.</p>

                            <p>The form that Ronaldo has displayed while wearing a Portugal jersey suggests that he could have the record for the most international goals to his name by the quadrennial event next year. Hopefully, they’ll be screamers and bangers to erase the memory of this one.</p>
                            <p>A good run of form could see them defend the title they won 4 years ago when they beat France to claim their first Euro Championship.</p>
