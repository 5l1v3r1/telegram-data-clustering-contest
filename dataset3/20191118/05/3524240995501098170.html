      <p>Ramon Azeez says he knows he has to wait for his chance in the Super Eagles but will grasp any opportunity given to him.</p>
      <p>Azeez earned a recall back to the Eagles after following strings of impressive performance for Granada in the La Liga.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old made a cameo appearance in Nigeria’s 1-1 draw against Brazil but was an unused substitute as the Eagles laboured to a hard-fought 2-1 win over Benin Republic in a 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier last Wednesday.</p>
      <p>He was paraded for 18 minutes in the team’s 4-2 win over Lesotho in Maseru on Sunday and made an assist for Osimhen’s second goal in the huge win.</p>
      <p>He admits that his limited time is down to a measure of the strength in depth in the Eagles squad.</p>
      <p>“There are players of incredible quality in this team. I always accept the coach’s decisions and I have to keep working with humility, compete with my teammates and when I have the chance to give my all for the national team,” said Azeez in an interview with <i>Sports Extra</i>.</p>
      <p>“I am calm and happy to be part of the group and I only have words of thanks for everyone because being here with my colleagues you can only learn more.”</p>
      <p>The win took Nigeria top of their qualifying group, with six points from two games.</p>
