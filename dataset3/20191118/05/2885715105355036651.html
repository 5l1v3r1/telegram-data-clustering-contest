      <p>THE STATE government finally issued a notification for the widening of <a href="https://indianexpress.com/elections/chandigarh-lok-sabha-election-results/">Chandigarh</a>-Landran-Sirhind road (State Highway 12-A) which was a long- pending demand of the people of the area.</p>
      <p>The road connects Chandigarh and Mohali to Fatehgarh Sahib district. The government will acquire a total of 6.9 acres of land for the widening of the road.</p>
      <p>The PWD recently issued the notification under which the government will acquire the land of Landran village following which the Landran T-junction will be widened. The T-junction is one of the most congested areas in the district and its widening is a long-pending demand.</p>
      <p>The government wants to complete the work by mid-December before the start of three-day Shaheedi Sabha, one of the biggest religious congregations in the state, which is held annually at Fatehgarh Sahib in the last days of December.</p>
      <p>Last week, Punjab Health and Family Welfare Minister Balbir Singh Sidhu held a meeting with Deputy Commissioner Girish Dayalan and asked him to initiate the work of road widening as the government had issued the grant of around Rs 22 crore.</p>
      <p>Sidhu had asked the DC to complete the work by mid-December so that the flow of traffic remains smooth during the Shaheedi Sabha in Fatehgarh Sahib.</p>
      <p>Landran T-Junction is a vital link for connecting Banur, Fatehgarh Sahib, Kharar to Mohali and Chandigarh. Due to the narrow road, long traffic jams is a common site at the spot. The 28-km road leading from Landran to Fatehgarh Sahib is also single-lane and a nightmare for the drivers due to heavy traffic.</p>
      <p>The government issued the notification under Section 21 (1) of The Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act under which the government also invited objections from the stakeholders.</p>
      <p>Under the notification, Landran village is declared as ‘Resettlement Area’. During his campaign, Sidhu promised to widen the road for the smooth flow of traffic.</p>
