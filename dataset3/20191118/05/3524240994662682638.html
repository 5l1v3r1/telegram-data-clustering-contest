        <b>Leke Baiyewu, Abuja</b>
      </p>
      <p>The candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in the Kogi-West senatorial district rerun, Senator Dino Melaye, has rejected the results by the Independent National Electoral Commission for the election held on Saturday.</p>
      <p>He described them as “magic results.”</p>
      <p>Melaye, at a press conference in Abuja on Sunday, accused his All Progressives Congress opponent, Senator Smart Adeyemi, and Governor Yahaya Bello of using violence, intimidation and inducement to frustrate the electorate in areas where he was popular.</p>
      <p>“Three people were shot and two died; four people were killed in Lokoja; seven were killed in the eastern part of the state; this is the record we have so far, apart from those who sustained gunshot wounds and those who were ‘macheted’ and all that,” he claimed</p>
      <p>Melaye said he was surprised that despite the level of violence and the reports of abduction of INEC officials and National Youth Corps Service members who served as ad hoc staff, the commission was collating “fictitious results,” which he said would not be accepted as they did not reflect the realities of the situation.</p>
      <p>Melaye further alleged that the results of Iyara, Adeyemi’s hometown, were written while mayhem was unleashed on his (PDP candidate) hometown of Aiyetoro-Gbede which claimed the life of his nephew, Olajuwonlo.</p>
      <p>He said, “We are waiting to see what INEC will do. But I reject in totality these fictitious results. I, Dino Melaye, won that election in the afternoon and the APC won it at night.”</p>
