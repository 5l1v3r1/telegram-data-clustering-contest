      <p><b>MTN South Africa</b> and Cell C have signed a comprehensive new roaming deal, potentially making it more complicated for Telkom to pursue an acquisition of Cell C.</p>
      <p>The new “long-form roaming and services agreement” will allow Cell C to roam on MTN’s network in all areas of the country. Previously, it only had access to MTN’s 2G, 3G and 4G network in selected parts of the country.</p>
      <p>“This is aligned to MTN’s strategy to further develop the group’s wholesale business and will allow<br/>both MTN and Cell C to harness greater efficiencies in providing telecommunications services, while<br/>supporting a more sustainable and competitive industry,” MTN said in a statement to shareholders on Monday morning.</p>
      <p>“MTN looks forward to transparent engagement with relevant stakeholders regarding this important industry milestone.”</p>
      <p>The expanded deal with MTN was a prerequisite of a planned recapitalisation of Cell C being led by the Buffet Consortium. Cell C has said previously that it hopes to have the Buffet deal wrapped up by the end of the year.</p>
      <p>However, Telkom last week said it is again interested in a possible acquisition of the troubled company. This is despite Telkom CEO Sipho Maseko having said previously that he is no longer interested in a deal.  — <i>(c) 2019 NewsCentral Media</i></p>
