      <h1>In Case You Missed It: Corruption, tampering and mental health in focus</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T05:06:24+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 05:06</time> by <a rel="author">ESPNcricinfo staff</a></address>
      <p>India will take on Bangladesh in the first day-night Test in the country, this week, tickets for which have apparently already sold out. India go into the match on the back of a huge win over Bangladesh in the first game, but will the pink ball test India's bowlers? Elsewhere, whispers of corruption in the CPL have surfaced, Sri Lanka are making corruption in cricket punishable by law, and Nicholas Pooran's busy fingers have landed him in trouble in the series against Afghanistan. Here are the big stories from last week.</p>
