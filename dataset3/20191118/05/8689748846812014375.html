      <p>Awal Suleman, the 25 year old nursing student who became the first Ghanaian to invade a pitch has revealed that police thought he was on drugs.</p>
      <p>Suleman disrupted the 2021 AFCON qualifier match between Ghana and South Africa when he suddenly leapt onto the pitch in the closing stages of the game, saying later that he wanted to take a selfie with Thomas Party.</p>
      <p>Talking exclusively to Saddick Adams Sports activities Obama on Angel<br/>102.9 FM Sports activities, Awal said the police insisted he had taken tramadol following his arrest.</p>
      <p>“As I have explained, I went unto the pitch to try and get a selfie with Thomas Partey because he is my idol and I couldn’t hold my feelings seeing him score in front of me.</p>
      <p>I initially saw where he was standing before I jumped in but following the chase, I lost sight of him and so started running in circles to escape the security so I could get to see him.</p>
      <p>But after they arrested me, the police were forced to take away my phone and I resisted. Whiles we were in the police van going to the station, they all insisted that I had either take weed (marijuana) or tramadol but I told them I don’t do drugs.</p>
      <p>They still didn’t believe so I asked for a blood test because I knew that there were no traces of such drugs in my blood. They all said I do wee or tramadol,” he said.</p>
      <p>After his release from police custody, Awal was given a hero’s welcome by his family and friends as they paraded him in town in a vehicle.</p>
      <p>However, he indicated that he had initially disapproved the idea of parading him through the streets but was coerced by friends to do it.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t want to be celebrated that way because what I did doesn’t call for a celebration. I erred and breached a code. Even my profession doesn’t allow me to bring disrepute to it so I knew I was wrong.</p>
      <p>I apologise to all Ghanaians and the GFA for causing the stoppage and further putting the lives of many at risk. I promise it will never happen again and I don’t encourage anybody to embark on such action,” he said.</p>
