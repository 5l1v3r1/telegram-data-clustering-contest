      <p>A group of doctors, nurses, physician assistants and pharmacists have created a New Patriotic Party (NPP) caucus in the Komfo Anokye Hospital to cater for the interest of the ruling party regards to the appointment of a new boss for the Ghana Health Service.</p>
      <p>This came to light after the Caucus rallied to the defense of Dr. Baffour Awuah whose appointment as the new Ghana Health Service boss has been mired in controversy.<br/><br/>Dr. Baffour Awuah is believed to have been a key member of the National Democratic Congress  (NDC) but schemed his way back to the NPP when Nana Addo became president in 2017 by being a Personal Assistant to current Health Minister Kwaku Agyeman Manu.<br/><br/>Several members of the ruling NPP who were staff of the Komfo Anokye Hospital when Dr. Baffour Awuah was in charge there under the erstwhile NDC administration say he made their lives uncomfortable because they were NPP members and supported Nana Akufo-Addo.<br/><br/>But in an orchestrated attempt to protect the job of the new Ghana Health Service boss, some alleged NPP-affiliated staff members who have created an NPP caucus say they not discontent with the appointment.<br/><br/>“We react to a statement circulating on social media suggesting that NPP medical team at KATH is discontent with the appointment. ..We wish to state that the author the person of Mr. Albert Opoku who claims to be the chairman of NPP medical team, KATH is not a staff of Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital and not known to the KATH branch of The Caucus of NPP Health Workers”, Dr E.K. Sarpong, the supposed president of the said Caucus wrote in a statement.<br/><br/>He added that “the Caucus of NPP Health Workers at KATH made up of doctors, nurses, pharmacists, and other paramedical workers seize the rare pleasure to thank the president, His Excellency Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo for the appointment of Dr Baffour Awuah as the Director-General of the Ghana Health Service” For those who claim Dr. Baffour Awuah is an NDC member, are irredeemable liars whose pants are on fire”</p>
      <p>“We therefore warmly congratulate Dr Baffour Awuah for his appointment and solemnly urge him to distinguish himself to bring glory to the big NPP family and the NPP Caucus of Kath Health Workers. Long live Nana Addo’s lead government, long live the great NPP Party and Kath NPP Caucus”</p>
