      <h1>New plans for massive former Kingsway hospital site revealed</h1>
      <h2>There will be a public exhibition this week</h2>

      <p>Clothing and homeware retailer <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/business/new-derby-next-store-would-2267732">Next appears to have abandoned its hopes</a> to open a big new store in Derby as a new project has been earmarked for Kingsway.</p>
      <p>Fresh plans for a care home, retirement apartments and a drive-thru coffee shop have now emerged for <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/news/all-about/property-news">land formerly home to Kingsway Hospital</a>.</p>
      <p>Next had looked at opening a shop with as much floorspace as ten tennis courts at the site. It was expected to be part of a plan to bring more amenities to Manor Kingsway, a 700-home project being built by Kier Living.</p>
      <p>However, although a public consultation took place, no formal planning application was ever submitted.</p>
      <p>Now, the new proposals include an 80-bed care home, 56 retirement living apartments and a drive-thru coffee shop.</p>
      <p>Developer Torsion Group, based in Leeds, say that it would create 150 new full- and part-time jobs.</p>
      <p>According to the firm, both the care home and retirement apartments will have private communal gardens and associated car parking.</p>
      <p>The plans will also include new landscaping and tree-planting across the site.</p>
      <p>More details will be revealed at a public exhibition, which will take place on Thursday, November 21, at the Kings Highway pub, in Kingsway, from 3.30pm to 7.30pm.</p>
      <p>At the event, members of the development team will be on hand to answer any questions the local community may have.</p>
      <p>A formal planning application would then be submitted once feedback from the consultation has been analysed by the development team.</p>
      <p>Martin Hutson, managing director of Torsion Group, said: “There is a real lack of bespoke care home and retirement living facilities in this area.</p>
      <p>“A care home facility alongside retirement apartments on this site will not only help to meet significant local need but also keep people in the area, making it easier for loved ones to visit.</p>
      <p>“The proposed design will be of a high quality, with significant new landscaping across the site.</p>
      <p>“We look forward to meeting with the community and discussing these proposals at our public consultation event.”</p>
