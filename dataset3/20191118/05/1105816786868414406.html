      <p><b>LUXEMBOURG: </b>Cristiano Ronaldo scored his 99th international goal as reigning champions Portugal secured their place at the Euro 2020 finals on Sunday with a 2-0 victory away to Luxembourg.</p>
      <p>Bruno Fernandes struck the opening goal on 39 minutes before Ronaldo tapped in a scrappy second late on to clinch second place in Group B behind winners Ukraine, who drew 2-2 in Serbia.</p>
      <p>Iranian striker Ali Daei holds the world record with 109 international goals scored between 1993 and 2006.</p>
      <p>“All records must be broken and I will beat that record,” said Ronaldo.</p>

      <p>Portugal became the 17th nation to qualify for next year’s multi-host tournament, which kicks off in Rome on June 12, joining the likes of world champions France, Spain, Italy and England.</p>
      <p>“We can’t give the match high marks for style,” said Portugal coach Fernando Santos, who admitted the heavy pitch made life challenging for his team.</p>
      <p>“I’m very happy for my players because the qualifying campaign has been more difficult than we expected.</p>
      <p>“We’re through to the finals of a major tournament for an 11th straight time. You’ve got to believe in these players.”</p>
      <p>Portugal knew they would book their place at Euro 2020 with a win or by matching Serbia’s result from their game in Belgrade.</p>

      <p>But they were made to work hard by a Luxembourg team ranked 96th in the world that notably held France to a 0-0 draw in 2018 World Cup qualifying.</p>
      <p>Sporting Lisbon midfielder Fernandes broke the deadlock before half-time, controlling Bernardo Silva’s pinpoint pass expertly before lashing in from 20 yards.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo, who smacked in a hat-trick in Thursday’s 6-0 thrashing of Lithuania, moved to the brink of his international century four minutes from time.</p>
      <p>Silva’s far-post cross was forced towards goal by Diogo Jota, with Luxembourg goalkeeper Anthony Moris getting a hand to the ball before Ronaldo turned in from the goalline.</p>
