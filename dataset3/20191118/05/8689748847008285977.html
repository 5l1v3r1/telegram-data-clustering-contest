      <p>Okyeame Kwame explained that, he didn’t want to be a celebrity, an icon or a star but all he wanted was for his music to be played on the radio even if it’s just once.</p>
      <p>But as fate would have it, he has gotten more attention and awards than he had anticipated.</p>
      <p>Okyeame Kwame further stated that, by just doing what he loves best, he has impacted Ghanaians in ways he didn’t think was possible. He also thanked his fans for appreciating him, criticising his style of music and helping him reach where he is now.</p>
      <p>The “rap doctor” also appreciated the squad he started with. He mentioned the likes of Dasebere Dwamena, OmanHene Pozo, Michael Dwamena amongst others for helping him discover himself.</p>
      <p>In his final statement, Okyeame Kwame said that as his voice has been heard by millions of Ghanaians, he now wants to be part of anything that will promote Ghana to the world.</p>
