      <p>Francis Uzoho is confident that the Super Eagles will rule Africa again.</p>
      <p>The Eagles last won the Africa Cup of Nations at the 2013 edition defeating Burkina Faso 1-0 in the final in South Africa.</p>
      <p>Gernot Rohr’s side finished third at the 2019 AFCON in Egypt last summer and have begun their quest to qualify for the 2021 AFCON in Cameroon winning their opening two games in the qualifiers against the Benin Republic and Lesotho.</p>
      <p>They came from a goal down to beat the Squirrels 2-1 at the Godswill Akpabio Stadium and also fought back to win 2-1 away at Lesotho in Maseru.</p>
      <p>Uzoho, 20, who recently underwent successful surgery on his knee after he suffered knee ligament damage last month during the Super Eagles’ 1-1 friendly draw with Brazil in Singapore tweeted, “It’s about time we rule the sky again Eagles, let’s make this all about Naija.”</p>
      <p>The Eagles are second-youngest squad in Africa at the moment and they boast of some of the best emerging talents from the continent like Victor Osimhen, Samuel Chukwueze, Alex Iwobi, Wilfred Ndidi and Joe Aribo.</p>
