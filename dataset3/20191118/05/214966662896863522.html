      <p><b>EARLIER @3.30pm |</b> A second crash on the M1 southbound has created a nightmare for motorists.</p>
      <p>A multi-vehicle incident has just about blocked off all lanes near the Reedy Creek exit (exit 85)</p>
      <p>It happened around 3.30pm.</p>
      <p>Multiple vehicles were involved, with one turned sideways in the middle of the motorway.</p>
      <p>It follows an incident earlier, where a truck and car collided in the southbound lanes through Palm Beach.</p>
      <p>Motorists are being urged to avoid the area if possible.</p>
