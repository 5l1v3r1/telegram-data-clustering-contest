      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 18): The prosecution in the 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB) audit tampering trial has called a second formal witness, Natasha Rahima Haryati Mohamad — an accountant in the Finance Division of the Prime Minister's Department.</p>
      <p>During her testimony Natasha gave a breakdown of the gross salary and net salary on a monthly and annualised basis of former premier Datuk Seri Najib Razak from 2006 to 2018.</p>
      <p>Najib's lead defence counsel Tan Sri Muhammad Shafee Abdullah elected to cross-examine Natasha on the payment of Najib's salary.</p>
      <p>In particular, Shafee asked if Najib's salary as PM was also inclusive of allowances, to which she responded in the affirmative.</p>
      <p>He also proceeded to ask her if this included his salary as member of parliament (MP) for Pekan and as Finance Minister.</p>
      <p>"These payments are only for under the prime minister's department," she responded.</p>
      <p>Najib was deputy prime minister from 2006 to March 2009, after which he was elected as Malaysia's sixth prime minister until May 9 last year.</p>
      <p>The court is now in a short recess.</p>
