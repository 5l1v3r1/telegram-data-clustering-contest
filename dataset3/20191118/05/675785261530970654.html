      <h2>The Girls Aloud star has been warned that camp-mates aren't given replacement clothes - so she may have to suffer if she can't retrieve them from their smelly new home!</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T05:36:48+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 05:36</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Elliott, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/sam-elliott/</a></address>
      <p>Worried <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/nadine-coyle">Nadine Coyle</a> could be about to find out just how ruthless Jungle bosses are.</p>
      <p>She lost her socks after using the infamous dunny as a makeshift changing room.</p>
      <p>Now she has been warned she may have to go without for quite a while.</p>
      <p>The Girls Aloud star was chatting to giggling Adele Roberts as she was getting ready - and soon discovered a problem.</p>
      <p>"I hope they haven't dropped down...." she said as she noticed them missing. "Oh no! I've lost the socks!</p>
      <p>"Do they give you more than one pair?"</p>

      <p>The answer, according to John Barrowman, is no.</p>
      <p>"I know from experience that if something happens to your clothes you're in trouble," he said on Extra Camp.</p>
      <p>"I had wax all over mine and they didn't give me any more.</p>
      <p>"Get them out and wash them!"</p>

      <p>Fans of Nadine have meanwhile begged I'm A Celebrity producers to bring in subtitles to help understand her strong accent.</p>
      <p>Flocking to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> , fans were joking about her accent.</p>
      <p>One wrote: "Subtitles for Nadine please <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ImACeleb?src=hashtag_click">#ImACeleb</a> ".</p>
      <p>A second added: "Sorry but Iâ€™m going to need a translator to understand Nadine <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ImACeleb?src=hashtag_click">#ImACeleb</a> ".</p>

      <p>A third harshly commented: "Gonna have to watch <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ImACeleb?src=hashtag_click">#ImACeleb</a> with the subtitles on, not because I can't understand Nadine's accent, but because I can't stand it."</p>
      <p>Another wrote: "Forgot about Nadine's weird Irish/LA accent <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ImACeleb?src=hashtag_click">#ImACeleb</a> ".</p>
