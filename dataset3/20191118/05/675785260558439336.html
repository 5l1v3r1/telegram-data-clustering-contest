      <h1>UK weather forecast: Met Office issue danger to life warning ahead of -9C freeze</h1>
      <h2>Temperatures are expected to plunge this evening bringing widespread frost and fog. The Met Office has issued a weather warning, urging people to be careful in the icy conditions</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T05:13:22+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 05:13</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Dresch, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matthew-dresch/</a></address>
      <p>Forecasters have issued a danger to life ice warning as temperatures plummet to as low as -9C tonight.</p>
      <p>If the mercury drops to -9C it will be the coldest night of the season so far, the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/met-office">Met Office</a> said.</p>
      <p>An ice alert for the Highlands, Orkney and Shetland islands is in force today, with the worst of the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/weather">weather</a> expected to end by 10am.</p>
      <p>The Met Office warning states: "Scattered heavy showers will fall onto freezing surfaces overnight and Monday morning. These could wash off any surface treatment and lead to the formation of icy surfaces."</p>
      <p>It adds that icy surfaces could lead to people injuring themselves by slipping over.</p>

      <p>Met Office meteorologist Alex Burkill told the <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/weather/1205515/BBC-weather-forecast-five-day-freezing-ice-snow-white-christmas">Daily Express</a> : “Temperatures could dip to -8C (17.6F) or -9C (15.8F).... on Monday night.</p>
      <p>“This would be the coldest night of autumn with the lowest temperature we have seen so far being -8.1C (17.42F).”</p>
      <p>A netweather.tv spokesman added: "After a day with highs of 4-9c (coldest in the north), temperatures will quickly fall during the evening bringing a widespread frost and a few fog patches overnight."</p>
      <p>The Environment Agency has 51 flood warnings and 90 less serious flood alerts in force for England.</p>
