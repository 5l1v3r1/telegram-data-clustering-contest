      <p>The carnage unfolded when a number of suspects barged onto the property at about 6 p.m. and opened fire while the guests were over watching Sunday football games, <a href="https://www.fresnobee.com/news/local/article237473114.html">according to The Fresno Bee</a>.</p>
      <p>“Officers arrived on scene – what we found were several individuals deceased in the backyard,” Fresno Police Lt. Bill Dooley told the paper.</p>
      <p>“Everyone was watching football this evening when unknown suspects approached the residence, snuck into the backyard and opened fire.”</p>
      <p>The suspects fled following the bloodshed and, as of early Monday morning, remained at large.</p>
      <p>None of the shooting victims were immediately identified.</p>
