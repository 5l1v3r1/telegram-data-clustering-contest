      <h1>Moss: a bio-monitor of atmospheric nitrogen deposition in the Yangtze River Delta</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T05:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author">Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences</a></address>
      <p>Atmospheric reactive nitrogen (N) deposition has more than doubled over the past century. Â It is very important to estimate the rates and sources of N deposition because it's considered as a main factor of ecosystem structure changes, such as soil acidification, water eutrophication and biodiversity losses, especially in countries with high N deposition, such as China. However, it is very difficult to obtain monitoring data of atmospheric N deposition because of the complexity of N species and the diversity of deposition forms.</p>
      <p>Mosses are very widespread. Almost all of nitrogen for mosses growth are from air and rainfall. Therefore, many researchers investigate N deposition levels and its effects by using moss, especially in Europe and Southwest China. However, whether mosses can be used to monitor atmospheric N deposition in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region has yet to be determined.</p>
      <p>"We collected rainwater and moss tissue at six monitoring sites in the YRD with three land-use types--urban, suburban, and rural and analyzed moss (<i>Haplocladium microphyllum</i>) N content, wet N deposition rate, and their N isotope signatures." says Dr. Tao Huang, from the School of Geography, Nanjing Normal University.</p>
      <p>Based on this study, they found a significant linear relationship between moss N content and wet N deposition rate. In addition, they also determined a consistent decreasing trend for moss N content and wet N deposition from urban to suburban to rural areas. The more negative N isotopic signature of suburban and rural mosses indicated N is mainly released from agricultural ammonia, while the less negative N isotopic signature of urban mosses highlighted a main influence from fossil fuel combustion and traffic emissions. The findings are published in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/16742834.2019.1688629"><i>Atmospheric and Oceanic Science Letters</i></a>.</p>
      <p>"The important revelation of our study is that the epilithic moss <i>Haplocladium microphyllum</i> can bio-monitor the rates and sources of atmospheric N deposition in the YRD, making up for the lack of monitoring data of N deposition," concludes Dr. Huang.</p>
