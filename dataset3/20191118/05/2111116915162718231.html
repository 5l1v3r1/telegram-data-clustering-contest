      <p>Last week, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/google-stadias-12-game-launch-lineup-is-surprisingly-weak">we reported</a> that <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/google-stadia">Google Stadia</a> would be launching on November 19 with a mere 12 titles in its roster. Now, on the eve of the game streaming platform's arrival, that number has grown to 22 – though you're likely to find the newly-added titles to be more than familiar. </p>

      <p>After receiving a substantial amount of flak over the platform's initial lineup, Google's Phil Harrison took to Twitter today to announce a near-doubling of titles coming to Stadia.</p>

      <p>There you have it: Google Stadia's complete launch lineup. If the new titles look familiar to you, it's because they'd already confirmed for release throughout the remainder of 2019.</p>
      <p>Of course, there are a few more announced titles that won't make it for launch, but have been confirmed for release by the end of the year – these include <a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/borderlands-3-review">Borderlands 3</a>, Darksiders Genesis, Dragon Ball: Xenoverse 2 and Ghost Recon: Breakpoint.</p>
