      <h1>Product review: SCOTT 350 Evo Plus helmet and Moto Hustle MX goggle</h1>

      <p>While I have been happily using my touring helmet when it comes to munching miles, I switched to a proper MX purpose Scott 350 Evo Plus helmet with the Hustle MX goggle as <a href="http://overdrive.in/news-cars-auto/features/hard-core-witnessing-the-2020-bmw-gs-trophy-qualification-in-india/">I participated in the 2020 BMW GS Trophy Qualifiers</a>. The ECE certified Evo Plus weighs 1.3kg and is offered in two shades with colour matching mesh lining that looks stylish. It offers an impressive build quality with premium alloy screws for the visor.</p>

      <p>Cooling you off are multiple ventilation channels on the chin bar, the forehead and the exhaust traps at the back. It also comes with a low friction layer inside the helmet to offer protection from any directional impact. Securing the helmet in place is easy with the D-ring strap. Riding off-road with the Evo Plus felt more convenient thanks to its lightweight construction, which is also important when you want to quickly alter directions.</p>

      <p>We paired it with the compact Hustle MX goggle that fits inside the Evo Plus really well with no-slip silicone strap. To offer proper ventilation, it comes with a mesh along with triple layer foam for sweat absorption, that prevents water from entering into the eyes. This is extremely helpful while riding in hot weather. The polycarbonate construction offers impact resistance and protection from UV rays. The impressive bit about the Hustle MX has to be the wide field of vision. Scott also offers a bonus lens with this Hustle MX package. The 350 Evo Plus is priced at Rs 14,990 while the Hustle MX goggles are available at Rs. 6,990. <a href="https://scott.sportnetwork.in/scott-sports/moto-sports/off-road/helmets.html">Both these products can be bought online from Scott India's website</a>.</p>
