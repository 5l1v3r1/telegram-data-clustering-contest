      <h1>Lily Allen and her adorable daughters steal the show at Frozen 2 premiere</h1>
      <h2>Ethel, seven, and Marnie, six, couldn't pass up the chance to dress as Elsa and Anna but mum decides to do her own thing as they all walked the red carpet together for the first time</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T05:05:30+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 05:05</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Elliott, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/sam-elliott/</a></address>
      <p>When you've got young children, the chance to see <a href="https://disney.co.uk/movies/frozen-2">Frozen 2</a> before anyone else is just an opportunity you have got to take.</p>
      <p>So <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/lily-allen">Lily Allen</a> was never going to let her two daughters miss telling their friends all about it as they made their red carpet debuts together.</p>
      <p>Ethel, seven, and Marnie, six, made sure they didn't let mum down and were on their best behaviour as they stayed out late on a school night.</p>
      <p>They dressed perfectly for the European premiere on London's Southbank, the first time they have gone to such a high profile event as a family.</p>
      <p>The girls dressed as lead characters Elsa and Anna but their 34-year-old parent decided against wearing a costume.</p>

      <p>Instead she wore an incredible grey grey with black boots.</p>
      <p>Lily may be right - divorce is suiting her rather well.</p>
      <p>The Smile hitmaker, whose split with Sam Cooper was finalised in 2018, said that the pair have worked out a 'perfect' arrangement where she has her two daughters for a 'week on then a week off.'</p>

      <p>Speaking on the Lorraine Kelly show last year, she said: "I can really recommend divorce to everyone!</p>
      <p>"When I'm working in the studio Sam has the kids and when I have the kids I'm mum. It has worked out.</p>
      <p>"I do a week on and week off. In terms of my work, it's perfect."</p>

      <p>Then, on Loose Women, she said: "Our custody agreement wasn't really something we discussed.</p>
      <p>"We're both really friendly, our kids go to school equidistant between our houses, so it works."</p>
