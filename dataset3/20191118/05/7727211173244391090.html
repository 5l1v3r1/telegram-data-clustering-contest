      <h1>Neighbours say plans involving 'hot guys in crop tops' will make their lives 'even more unbearable'</h1>
      <h2>Sugarboys wants to offer 'premium table service from hot guys in crop tops' until 7am</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T05:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 05:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/nick-tyrrell/" target="_blank">Nick Tyrrell</a></address>
      <p>Plans for a Liverpool club to open until 7am have been slammed by neighbours who say it will make their lives "even more unbearable".</p>
      <p>Sugarboys, run by national gay venue chain OMG, promises "premium table service from hot guys in crop tops" and can open until 4am under its current licence.</p>
      <p>But its plans to open until 7am has sparked opposition from police, a councillor and people who live nearby.</p>
      <p>The club, on Victoria Street, is set to go before <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-council">the council's</a> licensing committee at the end of the month and will have to convince councillors that later closing hours won't cause crime, disorder and nuisance.</p>

      <p>A neighbour who objected said noise and trouble from other nearby nightclubs was already an issue.</p>
      <p>They wrote: "The residents of this street have enough to deal with, with excessively loud music, customers shouting and brawling in the street to have to endure another nightclub in the area which will only serve to make the situation even more unbearable.</p>
      <p>"The residents in this area have jobs, university and other reasons to be up early on a Friday/Monday morning.</p>
      <p>"It is unfair to have nightclubs open, on these days in particular, until 7am with excessively loud music, drunk, loud and often trouble causing people when residents are getting up to prepare for and make their way to work/universities."</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/merseyside-police">Merseyside Police</a> have also objected on the grounds that the club could increase crime and disorder, while ward <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-council">councillor</a> Nick Small has argued the same in a submission to the committee.</p>
      <p>The application will go before the committee on Thursday November 28.</p>
