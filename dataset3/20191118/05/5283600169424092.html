      <h2>HP Inc rejects Xerox's $33.5 billion offer to buy the company</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T05:35:54+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 05:35</time> by <a rel="author">Reuters</a></address>
      <p>HP Inc said on Sunday it was open to exploring a bid for US printer maker Xerox Corp after rebuffing a $33.5 billion cash-and-stock acquisition offer from the latter as “significantly” undervaluing the personal computer maker.</p>
      <p>Xerox made the offer for HP, a company more than three times its size, on November 5, after it resolved a dispute with its joint venture partner Fujifilm Holdings Corp that represented billions of dollars in potential liabilities.</p>

      <p>Responding to Xerox's offer on Sunday, HP said in a statement that it would saddle the combined company with ”outsized debt” and was not in the best interest of its shareholders. However, HP left the door open for a deal that would involve it becoming the acquirer of Xerox, stating that it recognized the potential benefits of consolidation.</p>
      <p>“With substantive engagement from Xerox management and access to diligence information on Xerox, we believe that we can quickly evaluate the merits of a potential transaction,” HP said in its statement.</p>
      <p>The move puts pressure on Xerox to open its books to HP. Xerox did not immediately respond on Sunday to a request for comment on whether it will engage with HP in negotiations as the potential acquisition target, rather than the acquirer.</p>
      <p>HP on Sunday published Xerox CEO John Visentin's November 5 offer letter to HP, in which he stated that his company was ”prepared to devote all necessary resources to finalize our due diligence on an accelerated basis.”</p>
      <p>Activist investor Carl Icahn, who took over Xerox's board last year together with fellow billionaire businessman Darwin Deason, said in an interview with the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> last week that he was not set on a particular structure for a deal with HP, as long as a combination is achieved. Icahn has also amassed a 4 per cent stake in HP.</p>
      <p>Xerox had offered HP shareholders $22 per share that included $17 in cash and 0.137 Xerox shares for each HP share, according to the November 5 letter. The offer would have resulted in HP shareholders owning about 48% of the combined company. HP shares ended trading on Friday at $20.18.</p>
      <p>Many analysts have said there is merit in the companies combining to better cope with a stagnating printing market, but some cited challenges to integration, given their different offerings and pricing models.</p>
      <p>Xerox scrapped its $6.1 billion deal to merge with Fujifilm last year under pressure from Icahn and Deason. Xerox announced earlier this month it would sell its 25% stake in the joint venture for $2.3 billion. Fujifilm also agreed to drop a lawsuit against Xerox, which it was pursuing following their failed merger.</p>
      <h3>Test for new HP CEO</h3>
      <p>The negotiations with Xerox represent a major test for HP's new CEO, Enrique Lores, the former president of HP's imaging and printing business, who officially took over earlier this month.</p>
      <p>HP is mindful of large acquisitions given its fateful deal for British software company Autonomy almost a decade ago. HP bought Autonomy for $11.1 billion in 2011 as the centerpiece of its unsuccessful pivot to software. Little over a year later, it wrote off $8.8 billion, $5 billion of which it put down to accounting improprieties, misrepresentation and disclosure failures.</p>
      <p>More recently, HP has been struggling with its printer business segment recently, with the division's third-quarter revenue dropping 5 per cent on-year. It has announced a cost-saving program worth more than $1 billion that could result in its shedding about 16 per cent of its workforce, or about 9,000 employees, over the next few years.</p>
      <p>Xerox's stock has rallied under Visentin, who took over last year as CEO. However, HP said on Sunday that a decline in Xerox's revenue since June 2018 from $10.2 billion to $9.2 ”raises significant questions” regarding the trajectory of Xerox's business and future prospects.</p>
