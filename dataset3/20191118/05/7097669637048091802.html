      <h1>Trump's 'routine' partial physical exam at Walter Reed actually seems a little 'abnormal'</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T05:56:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 05:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://theweek.com/" target="_blank">Peter Weber</a></address>
      <p>President Trump <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/white-house-brushes-aside-skepticism-trumps-surprise-medical-exam-n1084486">spent about two hours at Walter Reed Medical Center</a> on Saturday for what he called "phase one of my yearly physical" in a tweet on Sunday. White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham said Saturday afternoon that Trump, 73, was simply "taking advantage of a free weekend here in Washington, D.C., to begin portions of his routine annual physical exam."</p>
      <p>Unlike Trump's previous two physicals, this one wasn't on his public schedule — or, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/17/politics/trump-physical-walter-reed-protocol-routine-presidential-visit/index.html">CNN reported Sunday</a>, his private calendar. Also, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/white-house-brushes-aside-skepticism-trumps-surprise-medical-exam-n1084486">NBC News notes</a>, the previous exams didn't involve "multiple 'phases.'" The medical staff at Walter Reed "did not get a staff-wide notice about a presidential" or "VIP" visit, as would normally happen, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/17/politics/trump-physical-walter-reed-protocol-routine-presidential-visit/index.html">CNN says,</a> "indicating the visit was a non-routine visit and scheduled last minute." One source told CNN that Trump's visit was "abnormal" but he'd appeared to be in good health late Friday.</p>
      <p>On Saturday night, Grisham <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/white-house-brushes-aside-skepticism-trumps-surprise-medical-exam-n1084486">told NBC News</a> that Trump "is fine — perfectly healthy," he had undergone "a routine checkup," and "speculation of this nature is irresponsible and dangerous for this country." On Sunday, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/17/politics/trump-physical-walter-reed-protocol-routine-presidential-visit/index.html">she told CNN</a> her previous statements "were truthful and accurate" and "actively trying to find and report conspiracy theories really needs to stop."</p>
      <p>It's certainly possible everything Grisham said is "truthful and accurate," but it's also odd, according to White House veterans:</p>

      <p>Like "thousands of other people who have worked" in the White House, "here is something I know first-hand," <a href="https://twitter.com/JamesFallows/status/1196200343014662144?s=20">tweeted James Fallows</a>, a Carter administration alumnus: "If a president needs routine tests, there's an amply staffed medical office right inside the White House. It's a one-minute walk." Whatever Trump was doing Saturday, he added, it was "100 percent not 'routine.'"</p>
