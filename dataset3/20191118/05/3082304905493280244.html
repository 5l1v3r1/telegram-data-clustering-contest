      <p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/1205636/Chelsea-transfer-news-Barcelona-Reinier-70million-Flamengo">Express</a>, Chelsea FC have entered the race for Brazilian wonder-kid Reinier Jesus. The 17-year-old is the latest South American talent to create waves with his displays, with top European clubs, including Barcelona and Real Madrid, vying for his signature.</p>
      <p>The report states that the Blues have identified the youngster as one of their top targets, as they look to add squad depth and prepare for the eventual departures of Pedro and Willian. However, they must hope that their transfer embargo is lifted in time for the January window before they can make an official move. If the rumours are to be believed, Flamengo will ask any interested club £60-£70 Million for his services.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Arsenal too are said to be keen on the attacking midfielder, especially after the success of Gabriel Martinelli. <a href="https://www.foxsportsasia.com/football/transfer-news/1199897/reports-arsenal-look-to-take-lead-in-race-for-brazil-wonder-kid-by-contacting-his-father/">The Gunners have reportedly contacted Reinier’s father</a> in order to discuss a potential move to the Emirates.</p>
