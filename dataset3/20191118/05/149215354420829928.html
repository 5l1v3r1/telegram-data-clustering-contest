      <p>A Trump adviser <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/trump-pulls-back-from-flavored-vaping-ban/2019/11/17/30853ece-07ae-11ea-924a-28d87132c7ec_story.html">told the<i> Post</i></a> on Sunday that on Nov. 4, Trump refused to sign a "decision memo" about the ban because he was worried about the repercussions.

While the move may please pro-vaping advocacy groups, anti-tobacco activists aren't ready to give up just yet. "If the federal government doesn't take strong action, it's clear now the states will," Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, told the <i>Post</i>. "There's a crisis that needs to be addressed."</p>
