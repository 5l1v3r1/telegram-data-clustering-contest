      <h1>Welp, Looks Like Sonia Kruger Isn’t Gonna Host ‘Big Brother’ In 2020 After All</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T05:44:21+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 05:44</time> by <a rel="author">By Cam Tyeson</a></address>
      <p>I tell you what, it is all bloody happening in the world of Australian commercial TV hosting gigs this off-season. Just when it appeared that <b>Sonia Kruger </b>appeared a virtual certainty to return to her previous gig as the host of the all-new <i><b>Big Brother </b></i>on Channel Seven, now it appears that will not be happening, and a different thing will be going down instead. The drama! The intrigue! The suspense of it all, I tell you!</p>
      <p>Last week, Kruger announced she was leaving both <i>Today Extra </i>and Channel Nine as a whole after eight years with the network, with the subsequent confirmation that she would be leaping across to Seven serving as one of the worst kept secrets in Australian showbiz in recent memory.</p>

      <p>The broad assumption at the time (which, again, was last week) seemed to suggest that Kruger would be slotting back into the <i>Big Brother </i>hosting gig she held during the series’ Nine run from 2012 until 2014.</p>
      <p>Sketchy reports this afternoon, however, now suggest that Seven has either a) committed an abrupt about-face, or b) never actually had Kruger pencilled in for the gig in the first place.</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://tvblackbox.com.au/page/2019/11/18/sources-sonia-kruger-joining-agt-not-big-brother?format=non-amp">industry whisper source <i>TV Blackbox</i></a>, Kruger will instead more than likely be joining the cast of <i>Australia’s Got Talent </i>in 2020, either as host of the series or as a judge, filling the vacant chair being left by the outgoing <b>Manu Fidel</b>.</p>
      <p>There’s some suggestion that Kruger is in line for a role on the new Seven production <i>Mega Mini Golf </i>as well, but lord knows what form that will wind up taking. The smart assumption asserts it’ll be as a host of the series, and not as an obstacle. Although stranger things have certainly happened.</p>
      <p>What becomes of the <i>Big Brother </i>hosting job – or if one even winds up existing – remains to be seen. Seven is said to be making some fairly wholesale changes to the tried-and-true format as it seeks to keep the towering costs of the reality series down. Chief among them will be moving the show away from it’s “traditional” Gold Coast home, likely to a soundstage somewhere in Melbourne.</p>
      <p>Like I said, it’s all bloody happening. It’s all going down, folks.</p>
