      <h1>Kajol’s ‘Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior’ first poster will remind you of her Maharashtrian wedding look</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T05:37:36+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 05:37</time> by <a rel="author">TIMESOFINDIA.COM</a></address>
      <p>Just a day prior to the release of the highly-anticipated trailer of 'Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior', Ajay Devgn presented the first look of his wife <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Kajol">Kajol</a> who stars as <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Savitribai-Malusare">Savitribai Malusare</a> in the upcoming feature.</p>
      <p>Describing her as 'Tanhaji's support, Ajay put out a new poster of the film showcasing Kajol in a traditional Marathi avatar. Donning a red saree, the actress is seen wearing a Marathi-style beaded nose pin, and similar beaded jewellery to complete her look. Perfecting her customary look is a dark red circular bindi on her forehead.</p>
      <p>We couldn’t help but notice that this captivating first look of the actress, bore much resemblance to her stunning look for her wedding to Ajay in 1999. Dressed in a traditional Marathi getup, Kajol looked like the perfect bride. Who would have thought that 20 years down the line, she would be taking on such a great <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Maratha">Maratha</a> character in her home production that also happened to be her hubby’s 100th film?</p>
