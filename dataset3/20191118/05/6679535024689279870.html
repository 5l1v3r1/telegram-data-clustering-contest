      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T05:07:43+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 05:07</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.thehindu.com/profile/author/The-Hindu-Net-Desk-248/" target="_blank">The Hindu Net Desk</a></address>
      <p>Members of Parliament have gathered in new Delhi as the winter session begins from Monday. Economic slowdown and Kashmir shutdown are likely to be the top agenda from the Opposition side, while the ruling party is armed with a series of Supreme Court judgments in favour of them, especially the one on Rafale deal.</p>
      <p>The winter session is from November 18 to December 13.</p>
      <h3>Here are the live updates</h3>
      <p>Rajya Sabha | 6.25 p.m.</p>
      <p>Session extended till the Deputy Speaker Harivansh completes his speech on the 'Role of Rajya Sabha on Indian Polity and The Way Forward' on the 250th sitting of the Upper House.</p>
      <p>He quotes former President Pranab Mukherjee, "Even as we celebrate this momentous occasion, it will be desirable on part of the members of the Rajya Sabha to remember that they have to maintain the fine balance between becoming obstructionist or redundant," to remind MPs not to show opposition unecessarily. He asks members to maintain maturity in the House and to participate in its spirit. He said the people of the country expect dignified debate in the Rajya Sabha.</p>
      <p>Mr. Naidu, concluding the special discussion concludes, "Improve attendance, pay attention, do not create tension. If you have tension, you cannot pay attention."</p>
      <p>"Let the government propose, Opposition oppose and the House dispose," he says and adjourns the House till 11 a.m. tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Lok Sabha | 5:30 p.m.</p>
      <p>Dr. Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar is in the Chair.</p>
      <p>Locket Chatterjee, BJP, West Bengal, talks about the Saradha scam. She attacks the TMC over chit fund scams in the State. Commotion ensues in the House. Speaker Om Birla intervenes.</p>
      <p>Jayadev Galla, TDP, A.P., says unregistered chit fund operators are 25 times more than registered ones. It is an unregulated industry, he says. This happens in spite of the parent act passed in 1982, which has been unable to contain such unregulated funds, he says.</p>
      <p>90% abatement is given to NBFCs but 30% to chit funds. The latter should also be given 90% abatement and should be exempted from GST, he says. He ends by lending his support to the Bill.</p>
      <p>N.K. Premachandran, RSP, Kerala, says chit funds provide relief to low income households.</p>
      <p>Lok Sabha | 5 p.m.</p>
      <p>Bhartruhari Mahtab, BJD, says the basic question that should be addressed pertains to why chit funds are flourishing. The general public, especially low-income groups, are unable to go to banking institutions, he says.</p>
      <p>"Why do such scams not happen in Tamil Nadu?" he asks. "These things need to be probed."</p>
      <p>Chit funds flourish because they are a necessity in our country, he says. Perpetrators lure investors with the promise of "astronomical returns" and "disappear overnight", he says. </p>
      <p>He asks what the proactive mechanism being built into the scheme is, that can prevent a scam in the making. He proposes the establishment of a State-level coordination committtee. "Chit funds flourish through whisper campaigns," he says.</p>
      <p>While going through the Bill, he found no clause that guarantees protection for the subscriber, he says. There is no nationwide guideline according to which all State governments should function, which leaves the subscribers vulnerable, he adds.</p>
      <p>Supriya Sadanand Sule, NCP, says the focus should be on the state of economy rather than on chit funds and ponzi schemes. They are all schemes put together by those afflicted with poverty, she says. She questions how such funds are going to be regulated.</p>
      <p>Lok Sabha | 4 p.m.</p>
      <p>The Chit Funds (Amendment) Bill, 2019, is under consideration.</p>
      <p>Gopal Chinayya Shetty, BJP, Maharashtra, is speaking. The banking system needs to be made friendly to ordinary people, he says.</p>
      <p>No MP and no Governor of the RBI has autonomy, Mr. Shetty says, adding that they are to conduct their function within the standard set by the Constitution.</p>
      <p>Kalyan Banerjee, AITC, West Bengal, is speaking. With the passage of the Banning of Unregulated Deposit Schemes Bill, 2019, there is no need to continue with the Chit Funds Bill, he says. "Why should this sort of business be indulged?" he asks. "Do chit funds constitute a valid business?"</p>
      <p>K. Raghu Rama Krishna Raju, YSRCP, says the changes to the Bill proposed by the Finance Minister are welcome. The States should not be given any discretion regarding this, he says.</p>
      <p>Shrirang Appa Barne, SS, is speaking. All those who have been accused in chit fund scams have been let off even after investigation having been started, he says.</p>
      <p>Dr. Alok Kumar Suman, JD(U), says the CBI has started investigation in 159 cases related to chit fund scams or ponzi schemes in the last three years. He also mentions the cases undertaken by the ED.</p>
      <p>Rajya Sabha | 3:30 p.m.</p>
      <p>Deputy Chairman Harivansh Narayan Singh is in the Chair.</p>
      <p>Ram Chandra Prasad Singh, JD(U), Bihar, says that the function of the second House is to improve any legislation that may have been passed in haste.</p>
      <p>There are certain Union Territories which do not have representation in the House, he says.</p>
      <p>Dr. K. Keshava Rao, TRS, A.P., quotes Dr. Radhakrishnan's statement on the House being not just a legislative body but also a deliberative body. He discusses the system of checks and balances.</p>
      <p>He also brings up the Punchhi Commission recommendations. It can be a Council of States if all voices are heard, he says.</p>
      <p>Lok Sabha | 3 p.m.</p>
      <p>Meenakshi Lekhi is in the Chair. Matters under rule 377 are under discussion.</p>
      <p>Nishikant Dubey, BJP, Jharkhand, is speaking. He speaks on low literacy rates, high dropout rates and poverty in Jharkhand. He asks that central schools be established in certain areas to ensure proper education.</p>
      <p>Suresh Kodikunnil, INC, Kerala speaks on the cashew industry in the State and asks for timely pensions for cashew industry workers.</p>
      <p>Dr. Gaddam Ranjith Reddy, TRS, Telangana, requests for the release of adequate amounts of urea to facilitate agriculture in the State.</p>
      <p>Rajya Sabha | 3 p.m.</p>
      <p>Sukhendu Sekhar Roy, AITC, is speaking.</p>
      <p>It is heartening to note that Mr. Modi, Dr. Singh and others have been advocating for the Rajya Sabha in contrast to others having deliberated its abolition in the past.</p>
      <p>He speaks on the recommendations of Punchhi Commission not having been implemented. He reads out some of the recommendations with regard to the Rajya Sabha.</p>
      <p>He speaks on acute centralisation of powers based on majoritarianism and says it is of utmost importance that Punchhi Commission recommendations be implemented.</p>
      <p>Rajya Sabha | 2:45 p.m.</p>
      <p>Former Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh rises to speak.</p>
      <p>He expands on the need for a second chamber in sound legislation. He cites B.R. Ambedkar's statement in the Constituent Assembly where he deemed the Rajya Sabha an essential component in maintaining the Constitutional system of checks and balances.</p>
      <p>"It is our responsibility to ensure that no law is passed in haste or in an atmosphere of heightened emotion," Dr. Singh says.</p>
      <p>He suggests that the Rajya Sabha should find time to debate centre-state relations.</p>
      <p>The Rajya Sabha is designed to be a permanent House, without the need to start afresh after every general election, he says.</p>
      <p>He assures full cooperation in making the House a more effective instrument of legislation.</p>
      <p>Rajya Sabha | 2:15 p.m.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi congratulates the House on its contribution to the evolution of India and its capacity to lead in various sectors.</p>
      <p>He praises the House on being "permanent" or "eternal" and on its "diversity". The soul of India's federal structure, and its diversity derive strength from the House, Mr. Modi says.</p>
      <p>He hopes that the current and upcoming generations would continue to fulfill the expectations set by Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan.</p>
      <p>He commends the House for its propagation of the idea of One Nation One Tax, notwithstanding what improvements the GST might require, which is an ongoing process, he says.</p>
      <p>He cites former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee's statement on not considering the "second House" the "secondary House".</p>
      <p>Rajya Sabha | 2 p.m.</p>
      <p>House reconvenes. Papers are laid on the table.</p>
      <p>Chairman Venkaiah Naidu speaks on the "unique role" of the Rajya Sabha. He mentions the passage of the The Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill and the UAPA Bill in 2019, alongside other Bills passed by the House through the years.</p>
