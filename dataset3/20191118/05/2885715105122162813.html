      <p>Bollywood superstar <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/aamir-khan/">Aamir Khan</a> on Monday shared the first poster of his upcoming film Laal Singh Chaddha on Twitter. In the poster, we see Aamir as a Sardar. This is the first time the actor is sporting a turban in a film.</p>
      <p>The beard, handlebar moustache and graceful smile also draw your attention to the poster.</p>
      <p>Well, it seems like Aamir Khan is set to wow fans with his transformation yet again.</p>
      <p>Laal Singh Chaddha is the Hindi remake of award-winning Tom Hanks film Forrest Gump. The announcement of the Hindi remake was made by Aamir on his 54th birthday on March 14 this year.</p>
      <p>The film also stars <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/kareena-kapoor/">Kareena Kapoor</a> Khan. The project marks the third collaboration of the actors after 3 Idiots and Talaash.</p>

      <p>Earlier this year, the makers of Laal Singh Chaddha had shared the official logo of the film. The short clip shows a feather (just like the one that made an appearance in the original Tom Hanks starrer Forrest Gump) as a song plays in the background with the lyrics, “Kya pata hum mein hain kahani ya hain kahani mein hum” (Who knows if we carry the stories inside us, or we are mere characters inside the story of life).</p>
      <p>Laal Singh Chaddha, directed by Advait Chauhan, will release on Christmas of 2020.</p>
