        <b>LONDON, United Kingdom, Nov 18 – Chelsea striker Michy Batshuayi insists he is loving life at Stamford Bridge despite struggling to break into the starting lineup.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Chelsea splashed out Sh4.3 billion (£33million) to sign the Belgium international from French outfit Marseille in the summer of 2016, but he has never been a regular starter.</p>
      <p>Loan spells with Borussia Dortmund, Valencia and Crystal Palace have followed, but they failed to provide the spark he needed to force his way in at Chelsea.</p>
      <p>The 26-year-old would have been hoping this could be the season, following the arrival of new boss Frank Lampard coupled with the fact Chelsea have not been able to make any new signings due to the transfer embargo.</p>
      <p>However, the emergence of Tammy Abraham as Chelsea’s leading goalscorer has meant Batshuayi has yet to start a match this season and the future looks bleak.</p>
      <p>He is third in the pecking order behind Abraham and Olivier Giroud and a move away from the Bridge is sure to happen at some point in the near future.</p>
      <p>It could even happen in the January transfer window if Chelsea receive the right offer and the player expresses a desire to leave.</p>
      <p>However despite his troubles, Batshuayi has spoken of his love for the club and seems determined to fight for his place in the side.</p>
      <p>“I have never been a full-fledged starter, but Chelsea is my club, that’s where I feel at home. It’s a club I love deeply,” the striker revealed.</p>
      <p>There should be no shortage of offers should Batshuayi feel the time is right to move on, with clubs throughout Europe ready to offer him the chance to get his career back on track.</p>
      <p>Chelsea will look to recoup as much of their outlay as possible but may have to take a small hit to get him off the wage bill.</p>
