      <p>Kieffer Moore says Wales' winner takes all clash with Hungary on Tuesday night will be the biggest game of his career.</p>
      <p>The Wigan striker scored the opening goal in his side's 2-0 win over Azerbaijan, a result that - along with Croatia's 3-1 triumph against Slovakia - means Wales' destiny is in their own hands.</p>
      <p>Ryan Giggs' men will qualify for Euro 2020 if they beat Hungary at Cardiff City Stadium.</p>
      <p>And Moore admits the occasion will be the greatest of his career to date.</p>
      <p>"It will rank the biggest. There is everything on the line," he said.</p>
      <p>“We have done our job and now it is all preparation and recovery for a massive game.</p>
      <p>“I know we are going to get supported by the fans because they are amazing at home, and away.</p>
      <p>“If I get to play I will give it my all when I step over the line and hopefully Tuesday is going to be successful and we qualify."</p>
      <p>Moore's early header in Baku means he now has two goals in his four caps for Wales.</p>
      <p>Giggs' troops are yet to lose a game in which the towering striker has played, with Wales currently on a five-game unbeaten streak ahead of Tuesday's crunch qualifier at Cardiff City Stadium.</p>
      <p>And Moore admits his style has been hugely beneficial for the likes of Daniel James and <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/genius-new-gareth-bale-chant-17269089">Gareth Bale.</a></p>

      <p>“They say some nice things. I just need to keep going and keep bringing the ball down and supplying them with the ball," he added.</p>
      <p>“Obviously they are massive attacking threats if I can giving the ball to them, it stands us in good stead.</p>
      <p>“I am very suited to the way this team sets up and plays.</p>
      <p>“As you can see I am reaping the rewards and working hard for the team as well.</p>
      <p>“There are better players around me, no disrespect, and the runs I am making and the balls there, it is a lot easier for me.</p>
      <p>“I will do anything for the team, put my body around.”</p>
      <p>Wales host Hungary in Cardiff at 7:45pm on Tuesday.</p>
