      <p>Speaking at the launch of the plan at the Mazimbu Campus of the Sokoine University of Agriculture (SUA in Morogoro region, the Minister for Livestock and Fisheries Luhaga Mpina said the programme is meant to unearth and streamline researches conducted by experts over the years and which remain in cupboards.</p>
      <p>The ministry seeks to introduce them for official use so as to spur a revolution in economic development.</p>
      <p>The sub-sectoral agendas will instill fresh impetus for researchers as opposed to the practice in the past when their research results used to be ignored, he stated.</p>
      <p>The minister directed the Tanzania Livestock Research Institute (TALIRI) and the Tanzania Fisheries Research Institute (TAFIRI) to reform so as to conduct research that would bring positive results in the livestock and fisheries sectors.</p>
      <p>He said the reason for coming up with the agendas stemmed from the realization that the former agendas failed to utilize the research results needed to spur reforms in the vital productive sub-sectors.</p>
      <p>The former agendas for livestock and fisheries researches did not have the formula for their identification, enlistment and utilization, especially researched from Masters and PhD students, he stated.</p>
      <p>He said: “It does not make sense – the researches by students in higher learning institutions are papers when they complete their studies and get pass marks to end up in cupboards. Today every degree holder will have to prepare a policy brief that will enable users, including the government to make changes or preparing policies and laws thereof.”</p>
      <p>Since the research agendas on livestock and fisheries did not have procedures in putting up regulations that would ensure research implementation, research agendas that are announced put up regulations that act as guidance in supervision and accountability of the concerned, he stated.</p>
      <p>Former research agendas did not have a system to integrate other livestock and fisheries researchers hence everyone did his research in his own way, a situation that made one issue being researched upon by more than one person and without a coordinating platform.</p>
      <p>The agendas just unveiled abide by the needs of national priorities, widening the scope of research as well as conducting research that provides answers to the nation’s needs. He mentioned these needs as relating to enhancing production of beef, dairy products, fish, hides and skins, livestock fodder, preserving grazing areas and stemming land use conflicts.</p>
      <p>Traditionally, when teaching curricula are established they are not researched upon from time to time, resulting in having lessons that are not really needed in the job market. Similarly it is unclear where students who graduate end up as there is no monitoring system, he said.</p>
      <p>Even though conflicts increase between herders and other users of land, resulting in the many challenges brought by the conflicts, this area was not incorporated in the former research agendas, the minister noted.</p>
      <p>He said other crosscutting issues such zoonotic diseases, bearing in mind 60 percent of non-communicable diseases come from animal products.</p>
      <p>To stem this situation research is needed on fodder, grazing areas and animal feed, he said, noting further that sustainable fishing in natural waters was also not found in former research agendas.</p>
      <p>The ministry will continue to cooperate with other stakeholders to ensure that the results of researches made reach those who need them in time so as to benefit them and the nation in general, he added.</p>
