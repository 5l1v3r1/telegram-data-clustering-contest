      <h2>‘More than 800 cases referred to MROs for report within a week’</h2>

      <p>Anandpuram mandal in Visakhapatnam district tops the list in grabbing of land by tampering of documents. This was disclosed on Monday by former IAS officer Y.V. Anuradha who is among the three-member SIT (Special Investigation Team) that was constituted by the State government to probe the alleged land grabbing cases in Visakhapatnam district.</p>
      <p>According to her, Anandapuram tops the list in tampering cases, followed by Pendurthi and Bheemunipatnam.</p>
      <p>The SIT, which is probing the alleged land scam in Visakhapatnama district, received about 2,434 applications from various sources till November 7, when it closed its counters. Of them, about 1,350 fall under the first phase of SIT and over 180 have been classified under second phase of the SIT purview. About 914 have been classified under non-SIT cases, which after investigation will either be brought under the SIT purview or be sent to respective departments for inquiry.</p>
      <p>According to Ms. Anuradha, of the complaints received, close to 250 have been identified as tampering cases, around 270 under change of classification cases, about 170 as encroachment cases and close to 125 as grabbing cases.</p>
      <p>While encroachment cases mainly pertain to encroachment of government land, grabbing can relate to either private or government land.</p>
      <p>Talking about the progress in the investigation, she said, “Of the 1,350-odd cases in the first phase over 800 cases have already been handed over to the MROs concerned for analysis and report. We have asked them to give a report within a week.”</p>
      <p>About 13 counters were set up to receive complaints from the 13 identified mandals such as Seethammadhara, Maharanipeta, Gopalapatnam, Mulagada, Pendurthi, Sabbavaram, Gajuwaka, Pedagantyada, Parawada, Anandapuram, Bheemunipatnam and Padmanabham. The counters were open from November 2 to 7.</p>
      <h3>Classification</h3>
      <p>The SIT has earmarked about eight categories to address the land grabbing issues such as change of classification of government lands, assignment made to ex-servicemen and political sufferers, NOCs given for the disposal of lands, government land grabbed by private individuals, encroachment of government land, government lands developed by private individuals or institutions without following the due procedure, tampering of land records and others, if any.</p>
      <p>In June 2017, the then TDP government had constituted a SIT to probe into the alleged land irregularities in Visakhapatnam district and it had received 2,875 petitions through various modes and considered 333 petitions for inquiry. But the full report was never tabled by the then State government.</p>
      <p>The YSR Congress Party, before coming into power, had promised that the report would be tabled if they formed the government. But instead of tabling the report, citing gross discrepancies in the earlier report, they instituted another SIT.</p>
