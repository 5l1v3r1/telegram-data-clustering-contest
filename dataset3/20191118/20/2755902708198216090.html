      </p>
      <p>Celebrated Zimbabwean Journalist, Haru Mutasa who works for Al Jazeera has social media in a frenzy after she posted a cryptic melancholic message on microblogging social network, <a href="http://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>, saying, ” She feels she will die young”</p>
      <aside>“I think I am going to die young …. there I said it. Don’t be shocked when it happens . Don’t know why, just a feeling.”</aside>

      <p>While some of Haru’s sentiments have been unpopular here and there, many of her critics and “twenemies”, in a rare show of solidarity and maturity, rushed to comfort her and have urged her employer Al Jazeera to check on her.</p>
      <p>Social Media Personality Mike Tashaya posted on his account, ”</p>
      <aside>We have sparred on these social media streets for many years with so many of you but when it gets to this level then we need to get out of battle mode and make sure we are all ok. Our health and well being is much more important than these verbal battles on these streets. Hoping Haru takes a break and gets the help she needs and comes back fresh to continue to add her important opinions to this volatile Zim digital space. Wishing her good health…</aside>
      <p>Patience Rumbi commented,</p>
      <aside>This looks more like a premonition rather than an intention to end one’s life. I know people who’ve had similar premonitions, and their cause of death wasn’t suicide</aside>
      <p>Michelle Mafusire Problem also commented,</p>
      <aside>Problem is we don’t accept depression as a society…hanzi aiwa get it together unechii chekuti you are depressed but that hurts us more cos we also been told not to talk about our problems….vicious circle….hope she will be on</aside>
      <p>Sometime back in mid-October, the decorated journalist who has worked for other influential organisations such as SABC and CNN, announced that she was going to quit Twitter as she found it to be abusive.</p>
      <p>She posted then,</p>
      <aside>“Off twitter hopefully for a while … tired of meeting pple who can’t be open minded, respect different opinions without insulting you. At the end of the day your personal life and family is what matters. Happy to leave. It was time”</aside>
      <p>We here at <a href="http://iharare.com/">iHarare</a> pray that whatever she is going through, she will fight and not let it take away her shine.</p>
