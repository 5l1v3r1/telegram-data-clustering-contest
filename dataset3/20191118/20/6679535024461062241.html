      <h2>Court pulls up Rohini RWA for filing plea</h2>

      <p>The Delhi High Court has said that there is no legal obligation on the part of the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) to provide electricity or water to the guards engaged by Residents’ Welfare Associations (RWA).</p>
      <p>A Bench of Chief Justice D.N. Patel and Justice C. Hari Shankar made the observation while dismissing a plea seeking direction to the DDA to ensure electricity connection, drinking water supply and toilet facilities at the guardrooms of Pockets 1, 3 and 4 of Sector-34, Rohini.</p>
      <p>“It appears that facilities like electricity, water, toilet etc. are not available at the guardrooms of the colony of the petitioner, and the petitioner wants the facilities to be provided in the guard rooms,” the Bench noted.</p>
      <p>“In fact, the RWA should have provided these facilities at the guardrooms instead of filing the petition,” it said.</p>
      <p>“The guards belong to the RWA. If the residents of the colony are unable to provide electricity, water, toilet facilities to their own guards whom they have engaged, then they should not have engaged those guards,” the High Court remarked.</p>
      <p>The Bench noted that the DDA has already provided 11 toilets for the guards apart from electric fittings and fixtures in the guardrooms.</p>
      <p>“So far as supply of the electricity, water etc., the RWA of the colony should have provided these facilities to its own guards,” the Bench stated.</p>
      <p>“In view of the above, there is no legal obligation on the part of the respondent (DDA) to provide electricity or water to the guards engaged by Residents’ Welfare Association of the colony,” the Bench concluded.</p>
