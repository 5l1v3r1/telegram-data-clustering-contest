      <p>Hon. Tajudeen Adefisoye, Deputy Chairman, House of Representatives Committee on Army, has assured that his committee will give priority to the welfare of military personnel.</p>
      <p>Adefisoye stated this when he paid a courtesy visit to the 32 Artillery Brigade of the Nigerian Army, Super Camp, in Okitipupa on Monday.</p>
      <p>The lawmaker, representing Idanre/Ifedore Constituency, said that his committee would work tirelessly to ensure that soldiers were well catered for in the discharge of their duties.</p>
      <p>He also promised to foster robust relationship between the military and the civilian populace in the country.</p>
      <p>“I am most impressed with the functional facilities that are available in the Super Camp, particularly the helipad.</p>
      <p>“The Brigade Commander, Brig.-Gen. Zakari Abubakar, also deserves commendation for the humanitarian services being rendered by the military to residents of the host communities.</p>
      <p>“Provision of potable water, distribution of sports wears and computers to students in the Ondo South Senatorial District by the military are undoubtedly deserving of commendation,” he said.</p>
      <p>The lawmaker also thanked Abubakar for doing a great job to curb crime and criminality in the state.</p>
      <p>Adefisoye also commended the traditional rulers of the host communities for supporting community policing.</p>
      <p>He lauded the leadership of the Chief of Army Staff, Lt.-Gen. Tukur Buratai, for making funds available to run the camp, thereby ensuring peace in the southern zone of the state.</p>
      <p>Responding, the brigade commander said that the ongoing clearance activities of ‘Operation Crocodile Smile IV’ had been yielding the desired results in the state and across the country.</p>
      <p>Abubakar urged the public, particularly the host communities, to take advantage of the hot lines provided by the Nigerian Army to provide useful information to attain success in clearance operation.</p>
      <p>The commander later conducted Adefisoye round the camp and explained to him its strategic security importance.</p>
      <p>Although Abubakar said that the camp was a military barrack, he, however, added that it also housed the police and other paramilitary agencies like DSS, Immigration, NDLEA and the NSCDC. </p>
