      <h1>Thousands of Disney+ user accounts have already been hacked and resold online</h1>
      <h2>The hacks started just hours after the streaming service launched on Nov. 12 and secured 10-million customers in its first 24 hours</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:21:32+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:21</time> by <a rel="author">Bryan Meler</a></address>
      <p>Not even a week into its debut in Canada, the United States and the Netherlands, hackers are already disrupting thousands of Disney+ users.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/thousands-of-hacked-disney-accounts-are-already-for-sale-on-hacking-forums/">An investigation by ZDNet</a>, a business technology news website, has discovered that many accounts are being hijacked and the information is being listed on hacking forums either for free or for prices that range between $3 and $11.</p>
      <p>The hacks started just hours after the streaming service — which provides access to a library of films and shows from Star Wars, Pixar, Marvel and Disney — launched on Nov. 12.</p>
      <p>It’s a tough reality for Disney+, which secured 10-million customers in its first 24 hours, with a subscription fee of $8.99 a month in Canada. These hacking issues join a list of problems for Disney+, after users encountered early technical glitches and crashes during its first week.</p>

      <p>Hackers have been reportedly locking users out of their accounts, logging them off all their devices that are synced to Disney+, then changing the user’s email and password info.</p>
      <p>Two Disney+ users who spoke with ZDNet under anonymity said they used passwords that they’ve used for other accounts. ZDNet suggests that hackers gained access by finding account info (email and password combos) that were leaked on other sites.</p>
      <p>But other users online have claimed that they used a unique password for the Disney streaming service and the accounts were still hacked.  In their case, they might have had their accounts hacked because they were infected with key logging or info-stealing malware.</p>
      <p>Upon investigating, ZDNet came <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/thousands-of-hacked-disney-accounts-are-already-for-sale-on-hacking-forums/">across ads</a> that were offering access to thousands of Disney+ account credentials. ZDNet reached out to users whose credentials appeared online and they confirmed that those accounts belonged to them and were still active.</p>

      <p>In the future, ZDNet recommends that Disney issues a multi-factor authentication process, to combat a hacking problem that Amazon Prime, Hulu, and Netflix accounts have been battling for years. While for users, their best option is to create a unique password for their account.</p>
