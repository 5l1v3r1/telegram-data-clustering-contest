      <h1>VIDEO: Awkward Mistakes Marvel Wishes It Could Undo</h1>

      <p><a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/marvel-studios/">Marvel Studios</a> pays lot of attention to detail when it comes to its movies. Although the franchise is absolutely momentous and has provided fans with some amazing moments, there are some things that Marvel Studios probably wishes it could undo or erase. We've compiled a list of twenty mistakes Marvel probably wishes it could erase from its films.</p>
      <p>We're starting with one related to <i>Iron Man 3</i>, the title hero's last solo film before his death in <i>Avengers: Endgame</i>. The movie saw Tony Stark going up against the Mandarin, which had been teased since the very beginning of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Well, at least the film pretended like it was going to. Instead, <i>Iron Man </i><i>3</i>'s big twist revealed that the Mandarin wasn't actually in the movie and was, in fact, being impersonated by an actor. Marvel did backtrack, later releasing a video indicating the Mandarin was real, and the villain is set to play a role in the upcoming <i>Shang-Chi </i>film. However, the blunder is definitely one Marvel might want to undo, at least adding that later reference to the movie itself.</p>

      <p>Although there's still a lot of uncertainty surrounding the future of the MCU and various characters, Marvel Studios doesn't seem to be slowing down or aiming to stop anytime soon. The studio has a lot of different movies in the pipe as well as series on Disney+. The MCU will also get a lot bigger sooner rather than later, as Disney's merger with Fox gave Marvel Studios -- which is a subsidiary of the former -- the ability to use such illustrious characters as the Fantastic Four and X-Men.</p>
