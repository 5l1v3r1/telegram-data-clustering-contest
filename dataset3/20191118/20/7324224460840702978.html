      <p>Pamela Anderson has cancelled a visit to see Julian Assange in prison due to a “personal emergency”.</p>
      <p>The US actress was due to visit Assange on Tuesday, before holding a press conference outside Belmarsh Prison in south-east London.</p>
      <p>A statement from the Don’t Extradite Assange campaign said: “Pamela has a personal emergency which has meant she has had to go home and cancel everything for the next two weeks.”</p>

      <p>Anderson says WikiLeaks founder Assange has been subjected to “traumatic psychological torture”, as she urged his home country Australia to stop him being extradited to the US.</p>
      <p>The former Baywatch star – one of Assange’s most high-profile supporters – visited him in jail earlier this year.</p>
      <p>She recently said she was “extremely distressed at the thought of his declining state” and added that her heart broke for him.</p>
      <p>Anderson tweeted that Assange was “hanging on like a super hero” in Belmarsh, where he was sent earlier this year after spending seven years in the Ecuadorean embassy in London to avoid extradition.</p>
      <p>Assange was jailed for 50 weeks in May for breaching his bail conditions after going into hiding to avoid extradition to Sweden over sex offence allegations.</p>
      <p>He faces 18 charges in the US, including allegations that he conspired to break into a Pentagon computer and worked with former US army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to leak hundreds of thousands of classified documents.</p>
