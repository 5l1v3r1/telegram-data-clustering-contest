      <h1>Tau’s Wide Role For Bafana Explained</h1>

      <p>Percy Tau had strict instructions to run at Sudanese right back Mohamed El-Rasheed following intel that he was being played out of position in the recent 2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier over the Fifa international break.</p>
      <p>Bafana Bafana coach Molefi Ntseki confirmed that he’d received information from his opposition scouts that El-Rasheed would perhaps not the best of defenders and gave talisman Tau license to have a go at him in their match on Sunday.</p>

      <p>El-Rasheed was yellow carded 24 minutes into the match for obstructing Tau and played the rest of the match on edge – giving the South African plenty space to shine.</p>
      <p>“We played Percy on the left wing because we have profiled their right back – he is actually a right winger converted to be a right back. So we knew that Percy would always have a go at him and I think he did exactly that,” Ntseki explained following Bafana’s narrow 1-0 victory over Sudan, who were hardly a threat throughout.</p>
      <p>Many would have expected Tau to be paired with striker Lebo Mothiba, but the national team coach explained afterwards why he’d deployed the Club Brugge playmaker on the left.</p>
