      <h1>JNU administration is root cause of crisis: teachers</h1>
      <h2>‘JNU V-C asking us to tell students to accept exorbitant hike is reprehensible’</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:13:42+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:13</time> by <a rel="author">Special Correspondent</a></address>
      <p>Responding to an open letter by JNU V-C to teachers, in which he asked for their “cooperation in maintaining a peaceful academic atmosphere in JNU campus” and to “make extra effort to convince the students that the changes in hostel charges are not only reasonable but vital for the financial viability of our hostels”, the faculty members said that the idea of urging students to accept such an exorbitant hike was reprehensible to them.</p>
      <p>“As teachers, we are keener than you [the V-C] that academic normalcy be restored. Unfortunately, however, we are unable to respond to your appeal in the manner that you have suggested. The reasons are very straightforward. We cannot disagree more with the view that the changes in hostel charges are reasonable and necessary. We are all well aware of what our students are going through and the idea of urging them to accept such an exorbitant hike is reprehensible to us,” the JNUTA said in its reply.</p>
      <p>They added that it was the administration led by the V-C that was responsible for the disturbed atmosphere of the campus as it had consistently refused to have any dialogue with the students. The teacher identified the administration as the “root cause” of the present crisis.</p>
      <p>The teachers also condemned the “brutal” police action against the students.</p>
      <p>What is happening in JNU today is of course not a sudden development but yet another symptom of a steady process of erosion of institutional processes and of a democratic system of governance that you have led for the last few years, which has had a damaging effect on the teaching-learning environment of the University, the teachers said. “ You have sought to only make everyone bend to your will rather than lead a collective and cooperative effort which would carry the University to greater heights. You have been repeatedly dismissive of the opinions and academic judgements of the teachers to whom you are today appealing and made so many of them victims of harassment by the Administration,” the JNUTA said in its letter to the VC.</p>
      <p>The JNUTA also condemned the “brutal and completely uncalled for violence” the Delhi Police unleashed against JNU students and teachers. “In the process of preventing the students from exercising their democratic right to march to Parliament, the Police inflicted severe violence on students on several occasions, outside JNU and then at Jor Bagh. Even teachers who had gone as part of a JNUTA effort to ensure peace was maintained were assaulted by the Police with full knowledge of their status as teachers,” the teachers said.</p>
