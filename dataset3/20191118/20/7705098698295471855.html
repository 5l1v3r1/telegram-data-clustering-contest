      <h1>Elizabeth Banks Blames Comic Book Films For Charlie’s Angels Bombing</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:51:17+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:51</time> by <a rel="author">Robert Workman</a></address>
      <p>Sony was betting big on its <b>Charlie’s Angels</b> revival this past weekend. However, the reboot badly under-performed with under $9 million domestically and $27 million worldwide. Elizabeth Banks directed the film, and she pointed the blame at comic book films during an interview with <a href="https://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/elizabeth-banks-charlies-angels-needs-to-be-a-box-office-smash/news-story/6734bbb011c524237b8bd58b54108531?fbclid=IwAR18WeP-HMNHvvUVl67CR6tJdt7UV0e8Xl4OdScDgblWkCnyrwud31ZvPIU">The Herald Sun</a>.</p>
      <p>“If this movie doesn’t make money it reinforces a stereotype in Hollywood that men don’t go see women do action movies,” said Banks. “[Audience members will] go and see a comic book movie with <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/wonder-woman"><b>Wonder Woman</b></a> and <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/captain-marvel"><b>Captain Marvel</b></a> because that’s a male genre. So even though those are movies about women, they put them in the context of feeding the larger comic book world, so it’s all about, yes, you’re watching a <b>Wonder Woman</b> movie but we’re setting up three other characters or we’re setting up <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/justice-league"><b>Justice League</b></a>.”</p>
      <p>“By the way, I’m happy for those characters to have box office success,” added Banks. “But we need more women’s voices supported with money because that’s the power. The power is in the money.”</p>

      <p>Before<b> Charlie’s Angels</b> opened, Banks told <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elizabeth-banks-charlies-angels-director-profile-11573754819">The Wall Street Journal</a> that a certain web-slinger already had his time.</p>
      <p>“You’ve had 37 <b>Spider-Man</b> movies and you’re not complaining!” exclaimed Banks. “I think women are allowed to have one or two action franchises every 17 years — I feel totally fine with that.” (Side note: Banks actually appears in the three <b>Spider-Man</b> films.)</p>
      <p>Side note: <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/tag/spider-man-far-from-home"><b>Spider-Man: Far From Home</b></a>, also a Sony property, did far better at the box office with over $1.1 billion. As noted by <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2019/11/ford-v-ferrari-box-office-charlies-angels-1202190127/">IndieWire</a>, <b>Charlie’s Angels</b> “will be a significant loss” for Sony, based on its box office performance.</p>
