      <h1>Man Utd transfer target Erling Haaland's dad 'visits Carrington training base'</h1>
      <h2>Norwegian wonderkid Erling Haaland has exploded onto the scene this season and has grabbed the attention of top clubs including Manchester United, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Juventus and Bayern Munich</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:56:05+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:56</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Erling Haaland's dad Alf-Ing has ramped up transfer speculation surrounding his son by visiting Manchester United's Carrington training base, according to reports.</p>
      <p>Haaland has exploded onto the scene this season, and has scored a staggering 22 goals in just 16 appearances in all competitions for RB Salzburg.</p>
      <p>The striker is at the top of every elite club's Christmas list ahead of the January transfer window, but has been most strongly linked with a move to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> .</p>
      <p>The Norwegian has previously played under Red Devils boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer at Molde, and given that Haaland was born in Leeds, he has a connection to the UK.</p>
      <p>Haaland has remained tight-lipped when asked about his future in the media - even replying with "no comment" on occasion - giving no indication on what his future holds.</p>

      <p>But according to <a href="https://theathletic.com/1387736/2019/11/18/live-qa-chat-football-with-david-ornstein-mon-18-nov-12pm-gmt-7am-et/?redirected=1">The Athletic,</a> Man United may be in the driving seat to sign him.</p>
      <p>The reason for this is that a source told the publication that Haaland's dad Alf-Ing has visited the club's Carrington training ground.</p>
      <p>This doesn't mean to say he went to discuss his son's future, but it will certainly come as promising news to Manchester United supporters.</p>
      <p>Red Devils fans may have to wait until the summer to get their man though, if Ed Woodward's recent comments are anything to go by.</p>
      <p>Executive vice-chairman Woodward spoke to investors on Monday, and while he discussed "material investment" he added "in the coming summers".</p>

      <p>Woodward said, per <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/man-utd-woodward-call-live-17273763">Manchester Evening News:</a> "Over the last few years, we have significantly invested in our recruitment infrastructure to augment our already strong and experienced recruitment team, all of whom who are all working to a clear philosophy.</p>
      <p>"This is demonstrated by the signing of Harry Maguire, Dan James and Aaron Wan-Bissaka, who have all settled in well.</p>
      <p>"We will continue with our strategy to promote the best of the players graduating from our Academy together with material investment in the coming summers to strengthen our young squad further and challenge for trophies."</p>
      <p>He added: "We have a clear vision in terms of football philosophy and recruitment.</p>

      <p>"The significant investments that we have made in recent years in areas such as transfers, recruitment infrastructure, analytics and our Academy are already beginning to bear fruit.</p>
      <p>"We are very proud to be shortly approaching a milestone 4,000th game featuring an Academy player, and we are particularly optimistic regarding the considerable young talent currently coming through.</p>
      <p>"Our ultimate goal is to win trophies by playing exciting football with a team that fuses graduates from our Academy with world-class acquisitions."</p>
