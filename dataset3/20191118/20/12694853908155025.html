      </p>
      <p>Samsung is kicking things off with <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-announces-galaxy-note10plus-star-wars-special-edition">special Star Wars-inspired variants</a> of the Galaxy <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-10-plus">Note 10 Plus</a> handset that’ll go on sale in time for the release of Rise of Skywalker next month.</p>
      <p>The new design elements and content will be bundled with a specially-designed case for the device and themed Galaxy Buds and S Pen. You’ll also get a metal badge and a commemorative box. In terms of the digital content, there’s wallpapers, shutdown animations, icons and sounds.</p>
      <p>It’ll be available in select markets from December 10, ten days before the firm is released globally.

      </p>
      <p>In our <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-10">Note 10</a> Plus review, published in September, we afforded a 4.5/5 star rating, thanks to its 6.8-inch AMOLED display with a 4,500mAh battery.</p>
      <p>We praised the lovely big screen, fast charging, useful S Pen deployment and versatile cameras. However, the camera wasn’t quite up there with the best handsets out there, while the 65w charger is not included.</p>
      <p>Our reviewer wrote: “The <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-10-plus">Galaxy Note 10 Plus</a> is the true successor to the Note 9. It’s a brute of a phone with a lovely display, plenty of grunt and a huge battery. There isn’t a whole lot new when compared to the S10 – but this still stands as the true high-end Samsung phone for the end of 2019. It also remains between this and the OnePlus 7 Pro for best big phone around. The Note 10 Plus has more features than the OnePlus – Qi charging, water-resistance, included USB-C buds – but I do love the 90Hz screen on the 7 Pro. Plus it’s notably cheaper than Samsung’s efforts.”</p>
      <p>A couple of years ago, Disney and Lucasfilm hooked up with OnePlus for a special edition launch for the OnePlus 5T. Unfortunately, the closest it got to the UK was a limited launch in Denmark, Finland and Sweden.</p>
