      <h1>Footballers in Spain make their stand and it pays off as clubs cede in player-wages dispute</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:09:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:09</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/molly-mcelwee/" target="_blank">Molly McElwee</a></address>
      <p>While the inaugural Women's Football Weekend in the WSL attracted 74,247 attendees this past weekend, Spain's first division was at a standstill. Empty stands and vacated football pitches littered the country as all eight of the Primera Iberdrola women's matches were boycotted by 200 players in the league over a pay dispute. The contrast between the two scenes is stark, but both represent moments of progress in the grand scheme of women's club football. </p>
      <p>One shows the game's ability to attract record-breaking crowds beyond international fixtures; the other could go down as the moment the Spanish league's players lay the foundations for their first ever collective bargaining agreement (CBA). In sticking to their guns and going ahead with their planned strike action on Saturday and Sunday, the players spurred a response from their clubs less than a day later, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2019/11/18/entire-weekend-schedule-spains-top-womens-football-league-postponed/">in a pay dispute that has been locked in failed negotiations for 14 months</a>.  </p>
      <p>On Monday, the Association of Women's Football Clubs (ACFF) finally shifted on the wages disagreement which had been at an impasse for over a year. Among maternity, injury and holiday pay, the players have been haggling tirelessly for part-time salaries in the league to be at least 75 per cent of the full-time minimum wage, which has been set at €16,000. But clubs had long contested that a €12,000 figure was unaffordable, insisting it should be 50 per cent, the equivalent of €8,000. Neither had budged, prompting the boycott. Now, in a major development to proceedings, the players have agreed to suspend their strike after the clubs finally appeared to cede to their request, inspired by the sorry sight of a weekend bereft of domestic football. </p>
      <p>Both parties have set December 20 as the deadline to secure the estimated €1.6 million required to meet the players' salary terms and officially put the CBA in writing. It is more than doable, the clubs have already had offers of similar sums from the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) and the league's main broadcaster, Mediapro, in efforts to avoid the strike - albeit with both offers including caveats over broadcast rights. The ACFF said on Monday that revisiting the RFEF's proposal is on the cards for later this week. It seems they are at last grasping the urgency of the situation - if the clubs fail to cough up in a month's time they now know the players will be serious in their intention to resume the strike. </p>
      <p>This bowing to pressure from players marks a major moment in a story that has proven female footballers are still fighting tooth and nail for the most basic of workers' rights. It comes at a time where the WSL and England's international football is making history on what feels like a weekly basis, the French domestic top division is also recording record attendances and the Australian federation granted their women's team, the Matildas, an equal-pay deal. But as the World Cup-winning US women's football team's equal pay lawsuit with their own federation showed this year, even those at the top of the game are still being short-changed. </p>

      <p>Women's football in Spain is not exactly in its infancy. Their national team reached the World Cup knock-out stages for the first time this year and the country's first division - or Primera Iberdrola - has been running in its current form since 2011, the same year the WSL was established. </p>
      <p>Though not entirely full-time, this is a league where clubs are given €350,000 every season from the Spanish federation (a requirement as a government organisation), alongside the varied financial backing 12 out of 16 of them enjoy from the La Liga clubs they are a part of. The €16,000 full-time minimum wage the Primera Iberdrola players are set to secure is nowhere near the national average wage in their country (€23,000), and the fact that injury pay is still not universally within players' rights, as well as maternity and holiday pay, tells of just how far the Spanish league is lagging behind. </p>
      <p>This is also a league that boasts the world-record crowd for a women's football domestic fixture, after 60,739 fans showed up to Atletico Madrid v Barcelona in March - Tottenham Hotspur's impressive 38,262 at last Sunday's north London derby paling in comparison. You would think Atletico and Barcelona's seminal achievement may have bolstered the players' argument that their part-time contingent be rewarded with a minimum wage they can work with. But it took eight months, the intervention of the Spanish Ministry for Employment and collective action to finally get that firmly on the negotiating table. </p>
      <p>"We are the same as you, we are workers," Athletic Club and Spanish national team player Ainhoa Tirapu said in a video posted by the AFE on Saturday, which was viewed over one million times. The effect of the minimum salaries she and her colleagues are fighting for will unlikely impact her directly - as a player no doubt on one of the higher wage scales in the league - but the video reiterated that this was not just for current players, but for players that will follow in their footsteps in the years to come. It is a credit to the unity of the entire league that, of the roughly 200 players available, just one arrived at her club ready to play this weekend. </p>
      <p>The nearly unanimous support was recognised by the president of the AFE, David Aganzo, in his statement on Monday that it was "a work of union, sacrifice, and camaraderie" that got the negotiations to this point. In standing together, the players' message was finally heard loud and clear by the clubs, and the hope is only that Monday's step forward will actually come to pass come December 20. </p>
