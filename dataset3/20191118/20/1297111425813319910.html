      <p>The Regina Pats made a rare swap with the rival Moose Jaw Warriors on Monday, acquiring 19-year-old forward Carson Denomie for 18-year-old centre Garrett Wright.</p>
      <p>Denomie, a Regina native, has five goals and 13 points in 19 games with Moose Jaw this season. The Warriors acquired him from the Kamloops Blazers midway through last season. He had seven goals and 13 points in 31 games after the trade, followed by two goals and two assists in four playoff contests.</p>
      <p>Kamloops selected him in the fifth round of the 2015 bantam draft. The 6-foot-0, 196-pounder helped the Regina Pat Canadians win a Saskatchewan midget AAA championship in 2017, finishing with 16 goals and 46 points in 44 games en route to being named a second-team all-star.</p>
      <p>“We are happy to add Carson to our forward group,” Pats GM John Paddock said in a media release. “He is a hometown kid and off to a great start this year.”</p>
      <p>Wright, a native of Mesa, Ariz., has seven points (all assists) in 17 games this season. The undrafted list pickup notched seven goals and 11 points in 63 games as a WHL rookie last season.</p>
