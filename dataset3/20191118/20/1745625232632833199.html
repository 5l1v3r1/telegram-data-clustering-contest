      <h3>American Hottie Brit Manuela Shows Off Killer Physique In Skimpy Vinyl Bikini</h3>

      <p>Brit Manuela posted a hot new update to her <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/instagram/">Instagram</a> page, which she paired with an inspirational message that encourages her fans to honor their emotions. On Monday, November 18, the <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5741838/brit-manuela-lowered-sweatpants-instagram/">American model</a> took to the popular social media platform to share a couple of snapshots in which she showcases her insane figure in a skimpy bikini that leaves little to the imagination.</p>
      <p>In the photo, Brit is posing under a deck at a beach in Malibu, California, as she indicated via the geotag added to her post. The model wore a black vinyl bathing suit that features an asymmetrical top with one strap that goes over her shoulder. The bikini top also boasts a neckline that sits low on the model’s chest, putting her cleavage on display.</p>
      <p>Brit teamed her top with a pair of matching bikini bottoms whose thick straps sat high on her sides, helping accentuate the contrast between her wide hips and slender midsection. The bottoms also featured high-cut legs, which further exposed her strong lower body. According to the tag paired with the photos, the bikini was from <a href="https://www.ohpolly.com/view-all-clothing/swimwear/escape-reality-vinyl-one-shoulder-bikini-top-black">Oh Polly</a>. The brand’s website indicates that the top and bottoms cost 20 euros each.</p>
      <p>Oh Polly is well known for sponsoring the closets of models and influencers, who often brandish its pieces on their social media pages.</p>

      <p>Both photos shared on the post show Brit in the same bikini and location. In the first one, she is tilting her head back slightly as she shoots a big smile at the camera. In the second, her face is serious, though her pose is pretty much the same.</p>
      <p>She wore her brunette tresses swept over to one side and styled down. She appears to be wearing little to no makeup, embracing her natural beauty.</p>
      <p>As of the time of this writing, the post — which Brit shared with her 819,000 Instagram followers — garnered more than 23,200 likes within just a couple of hours of being published. The same time period also brought in upward of 830 comments, proving to be quite popular among her fans.</p>
