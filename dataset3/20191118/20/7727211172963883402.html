      <h1>The key tactical, managerial and boardroom changes that have shaped Everton this decade</h1>
      <h2>A lot has happened at Everton over these past ten years to shape the club we see today</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:08:22+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:08</time> by <a rel="author">David Alexander Hughes</a></address>
      <p>It’s been a rollercoaster ten years at Goodison Park for <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a>.</p>
      <p>The decade started under the dependable <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/david-moyes">David Moyes</a> who had built an Everton side who were often <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/barclays-premier-league">Premier League</a> top six regulars and reached the FA Cup final at the back end of the previous decade. The same looked to be the perfect platform to push on again in the coming years.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately as we approach the closing stages of this decade, Everton have yet to reach another cup final and now find themselves once again trying to replicate these sort of feats on a regular basis under the stewardship of a new regime.</p>
      <p>But how have Everton, both on and off the pitch, changed over these past ten years and what were the key tactical, managerial and boardroom changes that have shaped the club we see today? </p>
      <p>
        <u>
          <b>The Moyes era</b>
        </u>
      </p>
      <p>The decade started with David Moyes still in the Goodison Park dugout and now into his eighth year in charge of the Blues. </p>
      <p>Over that period, the Scot had received plenty of plaudits for his structured and organised style of management that had often seen the Blues punching above their weight, reaching the latter stages of cup competitions and regularly finishing in and around the Premier League top six.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Moyes had worked with a tight budget for the bulk of his career at Everton but still managed to assemble an impressive side housing some great names at the top of their game such as Tim Howard, Phil Jagielka, Leighton Baines, Mikel Arteta, Tim Cahill, Steven Pienaar, Yakubu and Marouane Fellaini.</p>
      <p>
        <u>
          <b>The foundations of his tactics</b>
        </u>
      </p>
      <p>Moyes was often a reactive manager who diligently scouted the opposition, keen to adapt Everton’s approach and tactics depending on the strengths and weaknesses of the opposition.</p>
      <p>He tended to play variations of a 4-4-2 with a flat back four and flat midfield in order to maintain solidity. His side was well drilled and knew their positional roles and responsibilities when it came to both attacking and defending. He believed in a strong and robust defensive unit and would look to make that a priority within his side, with attacking intent acting as an afterthought.</p>
      <p>With the ball, he tended to instruct his sides to avoid heavy possession build-up and instead play direct football, deploying players such as Leon Osman and Steven Pienaar on the wings knowing they favoured drifting into the half-space areas to receive the ball to feet, or playing long balls towards Fellaini or Cahill who were often key aerial threats and good target men.</p>

      <p>From defence, Baines would often make overlapping runs and formed a deadly left-sided attacking duo with Pienaar, whilst Neville on the other flank would tend to be more reserved and defence orientated. </p>
      <p>Although they lacked the financial power of many of their rivals at the time, Moyes’ Everton side was industrious, boasting both a strong work ethic and team spirit that represented the club both on and off the pitch at the time.</p>
      <p>
        <u>
          <b>The Martinez era</b>
        </u>
      </p>
      <p>In 2013, Moyes left Everton to join Manchester United after the Scot impressed Sir Alex Ferguson enough for him to persuade the United board that his fellow countryman was the right candidate to continue to carry the torch of his success - however he famously lasted just ten months in the Old Trafford dugout.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>In his place at Everton came Roberto Martinez, fresh from FA Cup success with Wigan, but also relegation from the Premier League in the same campaign.</p>
      <p>
        <u>
          <b>The foundations of his tactics</b>
        </u>
      </p>
      <p>The Spanish coach had differing philosophies to Moyes. He was a lot more of a methodical tactician that preached the importance of possession football. He wanted his side to control matches, wearing down an opposition before exploiting them with good attacking play. He did this predominantly relying on a 4-2-3-1. Solid defensive foundations were already in place from the Moyes era with an impressive centre-back pairing of Phil Jagielka and Sylvain Distin flanked by both Baines and Coleman.</p>
      <p>Ahead of them, Gareth Barry and James McCarthy formed an impressive partnership in the middle of midfield. Barry proved the more defensive-minded of the two, protecting the defence and allowing McCarthy to feature more as a box-to-box midfielder, aiding in attack when required. Given his deeper position, Barry tended to be a pivotal cog when Everton were in possession, receiving more balls and keeping play ticking over.</p>
      <p>It was a breakout period for Ross Barkley too, with Martinez deploying him in the no.10 role. Whilst Moyes used the likes of Fellaini and Cahill in the no.10 role previously to add physicality and aerial presence, Barkley was apt and darting back and forth between midfield and attack to find pockets of space to pick up the ball and drive.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article12899095.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/GettyImages-668828868.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>In the wide areas, Martinez fluctuated between using out and out wingers such as Gerard Deulofeu and Aaron Lennon and using central midfielders who favoured drifting into central positions to open gaps for wing-backs to exploit, such as Tom Cleverly.</p>
      <p>Up top, Romelu Lukaku, who initially came in on a season-long loan from Chelsea before a move was made permanent, proved the perfect target man. He boasted good strength, speed and importantly worked the entire width of the pitch, making runs from wide positions and working the channels in order to keep any defensive line busy.</p>
      <p>His tactics initially proved a revelation and Everton finished fifth in his first season with their highest ever Premier League points tally, however, very quickly opponents sussed Everton out.</p>
      <p>Whilst the Toffees could always boast plenty of possession in their fixtures, they were frustratingly slow in using the ball, passing for the sake of passing and rarely supplying the forwards. Teams knew they could sit in a low block, frustrate the Blues and then look to explode in transition and score on the counter. Furthermore, the Everton defence lost key personal and it’s principles that had previously been installed under Moyes, meaning they were no longer assured at the back.</p>
      <p>
        <u>
          <b>The arrival of Farhad Moshiri</b>
        </u>
      </p>
      <p>In February 2016, billionaire Farhad Moshiri became the club's newest majority shareholder. The British-Iranian businessman initially acquired 49.9% of the club having paid a reported £200m - he has since increased that stake to 68.8%.</p>
      <p>Boasting financial might, he was deemed the missing piece of the jigsaw that Everton had craved for so many years and the man to even the playing field for the Toffees and push them onto the next stage of their evolution.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>His first task of note however was to greenlight the dismissal of Martinez who’s position had at this stage become untenable. He made the move following a dire run of form which included heavy defeats to Liverpool, Sunderland and Leicester City. There was clear evidence of support draining for Martínez from the fanbase and even a protest planned ahead of the final game of the season at Goodison Park vs Norwich.</p>
      <p>
        <u>
          <b>The Walsh and Koeman era</b>
        </u>
      </p>
      <p>In came a new regime, with Southampton manager Ronald Koeman Moshri’s favoured choice as Martinez’s replacement. The Dutchman enjoyed a prestigious playing career but hadn’t yet replicated those heights in management, however, it was hoped Everton would be the beneficiary of the same in the coming years.</p>
      <p>There was also a big change in the direction of the clubs recruitment strategy as the Blues brought in Leicester’s Steve Walsh as a Director of Football. It was a new role for the Englishman who built his reputation as a scout unearthing exceptional talents such as N’Golo Kante and Riyad Mahrez for nominal fees.</p>
      <figure>

      </figure>
      <p>Under the guidance of this duo, Everton flexed their financial muscle, spending a staggering £250m plus on a host of new faces over three transfer windows as they looked to buy their way towards the now well-established top-six.</p>
      <p>The problem, though, was that in an age where the game of recruitment is won by those sides utilising analytics to source and identify the players demonstrating elite potential, Everton’s strategy under Walsh seemed to be to recruit already well-established names for inflated and unjust fees.</p>
      <p>This meant these players burnt a huge hole in Everton’s transfer kitty without necessarily adding the quality you would expect in return for such an outlay. In fact, the duo actually failed to bring in the correct personal in key areas which ultimately led to a tactical unbalance on the pitch.</p>
      <p>
        <u>
          <b>The foundations of his tactics</b>
        </u>
      </p>
      <p>Koeman’s tactics were hard to distinguish. In his first season, he favoured a 4-2-3-1 but only used the same in 38% of Everton’s fixtures, often using a range of different formations as he tried to find a winning formula. There wasn’t really favour to dominate the ball or indeed play on the counter.</p>
      <p>In truth, the prowess of Barkley in at no.10 and Lukaku up top - who scored 40% of Everton’s league goals - perhaps masked unsteady foundations as Everton finished seventh without really threatening the top six sides.</p>
      <p>Everton lost Lukaku to United ahead of Koeman’s second season and Barkley’s intentions to leave were clear. Koeman and Walsh replaced Lukaku with the relatively unknown Sandro Ramirez and lined up not one, but three replacements for Barkley in the form of Wayne Rooney, Davy Klaassen, and Gylfi Sigurdsson. That in itself caused tactical issues as not only could all three not play together, but all three couldn’t replace Barkley’s ability to drop in between the lines to pick the ball up and drive forward.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article16371326.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Ronald-Koeman.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Behind this null attack, Koeman insisted on playing both Idrissa Gueye and Morgan Schneiderlin in the double pivot. Both players could break down opposition attacks well but lacked the offensive ability to launch penetrative counter-attacks.</p>
      <p>Koeman may have survived those initial few months of his second season had the Blues’ usually impressive wing-backs been in place to provide some attacking intent down the flanks. However, Baines was beginning to age and Coleman was recovering from a leg break suffered on international duty several months earlier, meaning Everton were relying on Cuco Martina - who couldn’t get a game at Southampton one season earlier - as their first-choice right-back.</p>
      <p>Koeman’s sacking in October 2017 after a 5-2 home defeat to Arsenal came as no surprise.</p>
      <p>
        <u>
          <b>The Allardyce era</b>
        </u>
      </p>
      <p>With Everton flirting with the relegation zone after no upturn in form under interim boss David Unsworth, panic prematurely set in and Sam Allardyce was appointed manager on a short-term deal and tasked with one job - avoid relegation.</p>
      <p>Although the Blues lacked any direction or stability, it seemed a fairly easy remit for a club boasting the playing staff Everton had.</p>
      <p>
        <u>
          <b>The foundations of his tactics</b>
        </u>
      </p>
      <p>Despite his reputation as an old-school football manager, it may come as a surprise to know Allardyce’s management style relies heavily on statistics. He possessed a team of data analysts at Bolton, long before it became a standard for almost all top sides across Europe.  </p>
      <p>At Everton, just like everywhere else he had managed, he played the percentages in a risk-averse and often dull brand of football. Everton’s play under him would often be direct and any attacking innovation was kept to a minimum. Additionally as a manager, he was happy for his team to forfeit the games they should lose and focus on the ones they should win.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>This was highlighted by the fact that in the league, Everton under Allardyce faced Tottenham Hotspur, Arsenal, Manchester City, Manchester United and Liverpool twice, suffering four losses, two draws and managing a combined total of just seven shots on target - an average of just over one per game.</p>
      <p>The Blues, however, did beat most of the teams they should have and finished a comfortable eighth. Whilst this brand of management achieved results, it wasn’t one Everton were prepared to stick too on a long term basis.</p>
      <p>
        <u>
          <b>Silva and Brands</b>
        </u>
      </p>
      <p>Before a new manager was chosen to replace the sacked Allardyce, Steve Walsh’s car crash two years at the club was also ended and he was replaced by ex-PSV Eindhoven sporting director Marcel Brands.</p>
      <p>Brands’ first job was to work with the Everton hierarchy to select a manager who could not only work in cohesion with Brands, but who was also capable of implementing an exciting style of football which would help Everton again challenge for silverware and the top-six places in the coming seasons.</p>
      <figure>

        <figcaption>Marco Silva and Marcel Brands of Everton</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>In light of the same, Marco Silva was appointed as manager on a three-year deal. Silva was already firmly on Everton’s radar from his time with Watford, with Moshri reportedly a huge fan. The club even made an approach for him after dismissing Koeman, but Watford refused to let him leave, despite a healthy compensation package being offered.</p>
      <p>Brands and Silva enjoyed a productive first transfer window together, adding both youth and quality to the side with the likes of Richarlison, Lucas Digne and Bernard all proving upgrades on what the club already had.</p>
      <p>
        <u>
          <b>The foundations of his tactics</b>
        </u>
      </p>
      <p>Whilst it was a decent if unremarkable first season for Silva at Everton, there was at least clear tactical trends he was looking to implement. The Blues proved to be a high pressing and aggressive side without the ball.  Although Silva will often line his side up in a 4-2-3-1, they will usually drop into a 4-4-2 without the ball and look to commence their defending in the opposition half. </p>
      <p>Whilst a high press boasts good attacking advantages generally, forcing possession turnovers in advanced areas, it is by and large a defensive tool, and Everton tend to implement it well.</p>
      <p>It contributed to Everton finishing in the top seven in terms of fewest goals conceded and lowest Expected Goals conceded (xGC) last season - which is impressive when you consider the team had major issues adjusting to Silva’s zonal marking system and conceded 16 set-piece goals.</p>
      <p>With the ball, in Silva’s favoured 4-2-3-1, the two holding midfielders playing in the double-pivot were tasked with winning the ball in the middle and quickly transitioning into attacks by playing direct vertical balls into the feet of the four attacking players in front.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://i2-prod.liverpoolecho.co.uk/incoming/article17234038.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_JS198136070.jpg"/>

        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Sigurdsson is a key player in this setup and would often be deployed as the no.10 - with mixed results. He boasted a great goal return and finished the clubs joint top Premier League goal scorer, but that record was padded out by penetliates. Away from the goals, he was guilty of being a passenger in too many fixtures which has sometimes halted Everton’s creativity in the final third. </p>
      <p>Iwobi’s recruitment may be key to rectifying this issue going forward. He is much more explosive on the ball and capable of finding pockets of space in between the lines. He has provided some genuine competition for Sigurddson in the no.10 role and could be a big player for Everton in the coming years.</p>
      <p>In the wide areas, attackers look to receive the ball into feet and then look to either cut in and fire shots towards goals, or dribble to the byline and cut passes across the goal mouth. Wing-backs still play a huge part in attacks, with Digne proving one of the Blues more creative sparks.</p>
      <p>
        <u>
          <b>The future</b>
        </u>
      </p>
      <p>Everton’s start to Silva’s second season was far from ideal, mounting plenty of pressure on the Portugese manager. But although they sit in 15th having accumulated 14 points, they are actually only three points behind fifth-place Sheffield United in an extremely congested division.</p>
      <p>Silva’s tactics have at times been too one dimensional and easy to scout for opponents, yet in recent months, we have seen adaption from the 42-year-old as he looks to find that winning formula.</p>
      <p>Despite their underwhelming run of form, Evertton’s underlying numbers for this season look good, suggesting they are benefitting from an all round good process and but have suffered some rotten luck - notably the VAR penalty call at Brighton of which the Premier League have since confirmed was an error.</p>
      <p>Should Everton start winning games, they’re likely to fly up the table in a hurry. With the Blues also into the latter stages of the League Cup, trophy success in February is a real prospect too.</p>
      <p>Despite the pressure he has faced, Silva still has a realistic chance of both lifting Silverware this season and claiming a top six finish. Should he do that, Everton’s start to the next decade will eclipse anything that was achieved in the previous one and should highlight they are in the capable hands both on the pitch and in the boardroom.</p>
