      <p>Tana Mongeau left little to the imagination in a recent <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B454mj5BjgT/">Instagram</a> post.</p>
      <p>The social media influencer, who is also <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/bella-thorne/">Bella Thorne</a>‘s ex-girlfriend, celebrated Christmas early by sharing two images of herself in almost nothing but a red thong.</p>
      <p>Her 4.8 million Instagram followers were treated to the photos this past weekend, where they racked up close to 700,000 likes at the time of this writing.</p>
      <p>“i want this under my tree,” one user replied.</p>
      <p>“Just imagine being as beautiful as her,” another fan commented, followed by two crying emoji.</p>
      <p>“So you didn’t come to play, you came to Sleigh,” quipped a third follower.</p>
      <p>A fourth user posted the Santa emoji with an arrow pointing to him. “asking this guy for you this year,” they wrote.</p>
      <p>In the first of two pictures, Mongeau, 21, posed on a red floor with her back turned to the camera, derrière on full display. She slightly arched her back as she put a red gloved hand on the floor to steady herself. Wrapped in Christmas lights, her platinum blond hair cascaded down her back. The top of her head was nestled in a festive Santa hat. Mongeau also rocked red patent leather stiletto boots. She wore faux lashes, a sparkle of highlighter, and her lips were puckered in a holiday-red pout.</p>

      <p>In the second photo, Mongeau looked away from the camera, left arm held high in the air. She was still in a tangle of holiday lights, but from this angle, fans could clearly see the holiday ribbons on each side of her festive underwear. It also gave followers a better image of her lacy red gloves, though the focus was clearly elsewhere.</p>

      <p>Mongeau, who is currently married to Jake Paul but <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5749340/bella-thorne-polyamory/">dated Bella Thorne</a> for more than a year, recently addressed comments from fans who claimed that she uses too much FaceTune on her pictures.</p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.seventeen.com/celebrity/a29813022/tana-mongeau-photo-editing/"><i>Seventeen</i></a>, it was clear that one of Mongeau’s recent posts from the People’s Choice Awards had been heavily edited using the portrait-editing app. Fans took notice and many called out the YouTube influencer for making her face look so different in the picture that she was practically unrecognizable.</p>
      <p>Seemingly in response to the backlash, Mongeau posted a photo of herself from the same event — only without nearly as much editing done.</p>
      <p>“swipe for a pic of me (with less facetune than last time) cause i’m narcissistic,” she wrote in the caption.</p>
