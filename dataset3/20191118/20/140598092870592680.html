      <h1>Somerset docked 12 points for next County Championship season after poor Taunton pitch in title decider</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:34:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:34</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/authors/tim-wigmore/" target="_blank">Tim Wigmore</a></address>
      <p>Somerset have been handed a 12-point deduction for next season's County Championship after being found guilty of breaching pitch regulations.</p>
      <p>A Cricket Discipline Committee Disciplinary Panel ruled against the county over the poor state of the pitch for their match against Essex at Taunton in September.</p>
      <p>Somerset needed to win the match to secure their maiden County Championship title. In the event the match was decimated by rain and, despite a sterling final-day effort from the hosts - whose trio of spinners claimed all 10 Essex first-innings wickets between them - the game was drawn. In total, 21 wickets fell in 148 overs - of which 17 were to spin - during the game.</p>
      <p>Taunton, Somerset's home ground, was long regarded as a batting haven but in recent years has become known as one of the grounds most conducive to spin in the country. Somersetâ€™s spinners - including home-grown pair Dom Bess and Jack Leach, who have both played Test cricket for England in the past two years - have been a crucial part of their success in recent years, which has included coming second in Division One of the County Championship in 2016, 2018 and 2019.</p>
      <p>The decision by a Cricket Discipline Committee panel means that Somerset begin next season on minus 12 points. This amounts to half of the potential points a team could gain by winning a match with full bonus points, and so represents a significant disadvantage over the course of the 14-game County Championship season.</p>
      <p>Somerset's full punishment is a 24-point deduction, of which 12 are suspended for two years. They have 14 days to appeal against the decision. A club statement said that they would "await the full report from the Cricket Discipline Commission before considering our next course of action".</p>
