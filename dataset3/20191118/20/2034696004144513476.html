      <p>Thousands of subscribers to the recently launched <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/disney-announce-launch-date-uk-ireland-2565728">Disney+</a> streaming service have had their account details hacked and put up for sale on the dark web.</p>
      <p>The $6.99 a month service launched in the US on November 12, with a reported 10 million people signing up for subscriptions.</p>
      <p>However, according to an investigation by <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/thousands-of-hacked-disney-accounts-are-already-for-sale-on-hacking-forums/"><i>ZDNet</i></a>, thousands of account details had been stolen by hackers and put on the market within hours of the service launching.</p>

      <p>According to further reports by <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-50461171">BBC</a>, many customers have reported that their emails and passwords connected to the account have been changed.</p>
      <p>Concerns have been raised that <a href="https://www.nme.com/tag/disney">Disney</a> uses the same login information for Disney+ as they do for their other services, such as the Disney store and their theme parks.</p>
      <p>The service is yet to arrive in the UK and Ireland, but <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/disney-announce-launch-date-uk-ireland-2565728">will launch on March 31, 2020</a>, it was announced earlier this month.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/disney-details-disney-plus-streaming-service-launch-price-release-date-2475744">Details of Disney+ were announced back in April</a>, a move that’s been anticipated for a number of years, and came after Disney<a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/disneys-merger-with-fox-is-becoming-official-next-week-2461058"> completed a $71.3 billion acquisition of a number of 21st Century Fox’s key assets, including its film and TV studios and a large amount of its ‘content portfolio’.</a></p>
      <p>It currently offers almost the entire Disney, Star Wars and Marvel archive, including new Boba Fett spin-off <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/the-mandalorian-episode-1-fans-react-as-new-star-wars-tv-show-launches-2567122"><i>The Mandalorian</i>.</a></p>
      <p>It has also been reported that Disney are working on remakes of <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/film/home-alone-reboot-disney-confirms-2535879#8PDl6eZK1jLh3w6z.99"><i>Home Alone, Night at the Museum, Cheaper by the Dozen </i>and <i>Diary of a Wimpy Kid</i></a> for the service.</p>
