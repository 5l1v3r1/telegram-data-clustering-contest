      <p>A staggering 20 per cent of football fans are 'comfortable' with homophobia in the game, according to research carried out by Paddy Power and Gay Times.</p>
      <p>A YouGov survey spoke with 1,010 heterosexual football fans across the country and found that 30 per cent still admit they find two men kissing at a match uncomfortable.</p>
      <p>Much has been done to stamp out homophobia in football in recent years, with the Rainbow Laces - and captain's armbands - campaign recognised throughout the game.</p>
      <p>But, to date, there are no players who feel comfortable coming out at the top levels of the professional men's game in England.</p>
      <p>What's more, only 37 per cent of the football fans who took part in the survey think the game is becoming a safer space for players to come out, suggesting more needs to be done.</p>

      <p>Tag Warner, CEO at GAY TIMES, said: "Recent years have seen real and meaningful progress in tackling discrimination towards the LGBTQ+ community among football fans â€“ but our research shows there remains significant work to be done.</p>
      <p>"So while football fans make the right noises by saying homophobic abuse has no place in the modern game and stress that they would like to see more out LGBTQ+ figures, it's depressing to see that a third would find two men kissing a problem while the same proportion believe homophobia is not an issue.</p>
      <p>"With Paddy Power we're committed to rooting out and kicking out homophobia wherever it's located.</p>

      <p>"These problematic attitudes tarnish a sport that brings so much happiness to millions across the country."</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Paddy Power added: "We come from a privileged position and have tried to make serious efforts to tackle homophobia in football for several years. These statistics show that while others too have done outstanding work to stamp it out, there is a huge task still ahead."</p>
