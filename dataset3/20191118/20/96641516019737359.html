      <h1>Apple's latest iOS 13 update fixes Mail, background download glitches</h1>
      <h2>iOS 13.2.3 arrives 11 days after the last update.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:20:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:20</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.facebook.com/richard.lawler" target="_blank">Richard Lawler</a></address>
      <p>Less than two weeks <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-07-apple-ios-13-2-2-fixes-background-apps.html">after the last iOS 13 update</a>, Apple is back with another minor tweak, this time raising the version number to <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210393#1323">iOS 13.2.3</a>. iOS 13.2 was the <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/10/28/ios-13-2-deep-fusion-photography-now-available/">most recent major update</a>, when it added support for Deep Fusion photography and the AirPods Pro last month. This one gives iPads and iPhones fixes meant to address issues with the built-in Mail, Files and Notes apps, as well as a problem that could stop apps from downloading information in the background -- Apple didn't mention any fixes for security issues.</p>
      <blockquote>iOS 13.2.3 includes bug fixes and improvements for your iPhone. This update:<br/><br/>• Fixes an issue where system search and search within Mail, Files, and Notes might not work<br/>• Addresses an issue where photos, links, and other attachments might not display in the Messages details view<br/>• Fixes an issue that could prevent apps from downloading content in the background<br/>• Resolves issues that may prevent Mail from fetching new messages, and fail to include and quote original message content in Exchange accounts</blockquote>
      <p>None appear to be as pressing as the last update that <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2019/11/07/apple-ios-13-2-2-fixes-background-apps/">solved some major multitasking headaches</a>, but you may want to install it sooner rather than later to avoid missing any messages.</p>
