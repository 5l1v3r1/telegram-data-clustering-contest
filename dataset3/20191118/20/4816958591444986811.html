      <p>Failed politician Kevin O’Leary has, we learn from Monday’s newspaper, an April court date in Ontario for his Charter challenge to federal campaign finance rules. O’Leary, you will recall, has been inconvenienced by law forbidding him from writing a fat cheque to cover the remaining debt incurred in his short-lived CPC leadership effort. He now calls these rules, which were in place when he entered the contest, an abominable affront to his civil rights — and even an affront to your rights and mine.</p>
      <p>Yes, really. This particular argument, found in O’Leary’s <a href="http://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/5115619/Kevin-O-Leary.pdf">original</a> statement of claim, deserves emphasis as somehow ultimately characteristic of the man himself. Because of the regulations in the Elections Act, the plea ran, “it is extremely difficult to run a serious leadership campaign without incurring significant debt. Leadership candidates are then subject to the possibility of imprisonment if they fail to pay back their debts with three years.</p>
      <p>“This state of affairs could, and no doubt already has, discouraged otherwise qualified candidates from running for party leadership. This in turn reduces the overall pool of candidates, infringing on the right of electors to be able to vote in a manner that accurately reflects their individual preferences.”</p>
      <p>I am sure there are Conservatives who are still disappointed that they did not have a chance, in the end, to vote for O’Leary as their leader. Maybe there are more of them right now than there were before last month’s federal election. But have these unfortunates considered the question in this precise light — namely, that their own rights to political participation are actually being infringed because O’Leary is required to extinguish his campaign debts by raising money from others? They may throw him into prison, but the real injury is to us.</p>
      <p>Some of the other arguments in O’Leary’s Charter suit against Elections Canada are less comic than this. For my money his most creative attack on the edifice of election finance law is that there is no “rational connection” between the overall goal of the Elections Act and the specific provisions concerning leadership campaigns.</p>
      <aside>Parties should be free to choose their leaders in a manner of their choosing</aside>
      <p>The Elections Act is intended to make elections fair, which may justify spending and donor rules once an election is called; but parties, O’Leary’s claim insisted, should be “free to choose their leaders in a manner of their choosing.” Leadership races are no proper business of Elections Canada at all, at least when Charter rights are being suppressed — as, indeed, they undoubtedly are by the financing regulations.</p>
      <p>This particular argument is not too likely to fly with a court. Perusal of the caselaw suggests that the accepted goal of the Elections Act is to give Canadians a healthy political system, and not just healthy elections. Although the rules about leadership contests have been largely untested for Charter soundness are now, the Supreme Court’s landmark Harper vs. Canada decision (2004) takes pains to <a href="https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2004/2004scc33/2004scc33.pdf">emphasize</a> that Parliament will be given “a healthy measure of deference” in pursuit of the liberal goal of reducing the influence of wealth on elections.</p>

      <p>Yet I cannot help feeling some sympathy with any attack on the rationality of campaign finance law as it operates in Canada. Does anyone remember the forgotten era (2004-2015) of per-vote public subsidies for federal parties? We were promised by about three-quarters of the political scientists in the country that when the Harper government reversed this innovation, there would be two main effects.</p>
      <p>One was that the Conservatives, the party best placed to fundraise from individuals with disposable incomes, would have a permanent and decisive electoral advantage. The other is that small parties would be swept away on a tide of major-party cash. What would be exceedingly unlikely in a post-subsidy era, if cash determines election outcomes, is that Canada would ever again end up having a hung House of Commons with the Conservatives in Opposition.</p>
      <h3>Money, money</h3>
      <p>Perhaps there was a bad premise somewhere in the experts’ syllogism. The other thing I find myself reflecting on is the Conservative leadership race of 2017 — the very one in which O’Leary tested the waters. Statutory regulation was supposed to remove the influence of money from the whole process, but this may actually have tempted O’Leary to become an “earned media” candidate, like Donald Trump to the south before him.</p>
      <p>The earned-media coup did not come to pass — not yet. Instead, the CPC leadership contest, purged by statute of the baleful influence of corporations and labour unions, somehow ended up revolving around… the interests of a few thousand dairy farmers.</p>
      <p>One could swear, watching the thing unfold, that campaign finance restrictions had merely served to skim off the uppermost layers of traditional influence, leaving the leadership process helpless before a small coterie of strongly motivated individual rentiers whose wealth happened to depend on a particular policy regime. I for one would not like to go to bat for this as the rational result of a rational policy, but I’m no lawyer.</p>
