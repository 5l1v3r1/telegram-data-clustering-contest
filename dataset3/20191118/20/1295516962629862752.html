      <p>With Marvel Studios' Infinity Saga having come to a close, one of the studios' artists provided a look back on the franchise's humble beginnings with the reveal of concept art for 2008's <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/iron-man-film/"><i>Iron Man</i></a>.</p>
      <p>Marvel Studios' Head of Visual Development, Ryan Meinerding, initially revealed the art on social media. "Here is an unused version of Tony being stuck in the suit up gantry from the first Iron Man," he wrote. "I was trying to suggest a bit of a romantic moment between Pepper and Tony." Although not too different from the version seen on screen, the image shows a distressed Tony Stark being assisted out of his armor's gantry by personal assistant Pepper Potts.</p>
