      <p>CHICAGO -- The United States Post Office's annual Santa letter program Operation Santa kicks off Monday, November 18.</p>
      <p>The goal of the campaign is to give kids who may not be able to otherwise, the happy holiday they deserve.</p>
      <p>Started in 1912, Postmaster General Frank Hitchcock authorized local Postmasters to allow postal employees and citizens to respond to the letters - a program that eventually became known as Operation Santa.</p>
      <p>To celebrate 107 years, USPS launched a new website for Operation Santa which will feature letters from children in across the country.</p>
      <p>This year letters from Chicago along with 14 other cities will be displayed on the website through the holiday season.</p>
      <p>Residents in Chicago will have a choice of browsing and adopting letters to Santa online or in person.</p>
      <p>
