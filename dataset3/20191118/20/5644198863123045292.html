      <p>LONDON: China will not simply sit back and watch if months of protests in Hong Kong develop into an "uncontrollable" situation, the country's ambassador to Britain said Monday (Nov 18).</p>
      <p>"I think the Hong Kong government is trying very hard to put the situation under control," Liu Xiaoming told a London press conference, as fresh violence erupts after months of protests.</p>

      <p>"But if the situation becomes uncontrollable, the central government would certainly not sit on our hands and watch. We have enough resolution and power to end the unrest."</p>

      <p>His comments come after a brief and rare deployment of Chinese troops in Hong Kong over the weekend to clean up streets.</p>
      <p>The Chinese People's Liberation Army has a barracks in an upper-class district of Hong Kong.</p>
      <p>Asked about a possible intervention, the envoy said: "They are there to show Chinese sovereignty and they are there for defence purposes."</p>
      <p>Liu also warned against "external interference" in internal Chinese affairs, singling out Britain and the United States.</p>

      <p>"Some Western countries have publicly supported extreme violent offenders, the US House of Representatives adopted the so-called <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/hong-kong-protests-us-pass-human-rights-democracy-bill-12005608">Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act</a> to blatantly interfere in Hong Kong affairs, which are China's internal affairs," Liu said.</p>
      <p>"The British government and the foreign affairs committee of the House of Commons published China-related reports making irresponsible remarks on Hong Kong. What is worse certain British politicians even planned to present (an) award to a chief propagandist for Hong Kong independence."</p>

      <p>Britain said it was seriously concerned by the violence on both sides at Hong Kong's universities and called for safe passage and medical assistance be given to those trapped at the campuses.</p>
      <p>"We remain seriously concerned by the situation in Hong Kong and the escalation of violence between protesters and police. We continue to urge for calm and restraint on all sides and support the right to peaceful protest," a spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday.</p>
      <p>"It is vital that those who are injured are able to receive appropriate medical treatment, and that safe passage is made available for all those who wish to leave the area," Britain's Foreign Office said.</p>

      <p>It called for an end to the violence, "and for all sides to engage in meaningful political dialogue ahead of the District Council elections on Sunday".</p>
      <p>Liu Xiaoming accused the protesters of trying to destabilise and paralyse Hong Kong to "seize power".</p>
      <p>"Hong Kong citizens live under black terror created by violent extremism with their life and property under severe threat," he said.</p>

      <p>Hong Kong's economy has slumped into technical recession because of the months of protests, denting its international image as a place to do business, he said.</p>
      <p>"The once 'Oriental pearl' is turning into the 'Oriental scar'. Hong Kong, the 'fragrant harbour', is sliding into 'an abyss of chaos'.</p>
      <p>"The future of Hong Kong, if such a situation continues, would be unimaginably dreadful."</p>
