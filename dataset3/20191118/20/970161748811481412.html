      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/ant-mcpartlin/">Ant McPartlin</a> and Dec Donnelly publicly burned Piers Morgan and we’re absolutely sure it’s gonna lead to a Twitter war.</p>
      <p>It all started when the duo made a joke about I’m A Celeb contestant and TV presenter <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/kate-garraway/">Kate Garraway</a> entering the show last night.</p>
      <p>Dec jibed: ‘We’ve got Kate Garraway, who’s preparing to face the most harrowing ordeal of her entire life…’</p>
      <p>Then Ant jumped in: ‘But before she goes back to work with Piers Morgan, she’s got three weeks in the jungle!’</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Good Morning Britain then played the clip on this morning’s show to get Piers’ reaction live on air and it was just as petty and priceless as we could’ve hoped for.</p>
      <p>Clearly irked by it, he sarcastically laughed, then mimicked Ant’s Geordie accent and dialled up the sarcasm: ‘It’s so good to have him back.’</p>
      <p>He then kept a straight face as co-host Susanna Reid tried to comfort him: ‘They couldn’t afford you so they mention you at every opportunity.’</p>
      <p>But then came the kicker…</p>

      <p>Ant and Dec (from their joint account) quote-tweeted a link to a news story about Piers’ reaction and simply wrote: ‘Snowflake’.</p>
      <p>They also used a cry-laughing emoji to add salt to the wound.</p>
      <p>At the time of writing, Ant and Dec have amassed more than 36k likes and 2.7k retweets on their tweet.</p>
      <p>One fan responded: ‘He can dish it out but can’t take it – just like most bullies’.</p>
      <p>While another replied: ‘Twitter war, here we come’.</p>

      <p>Piers Morgan, incensed, then tweeted: ‘At least I have my own Twitter account &amp; don’t have to share one with my mate.’</p>
      <p>‘Oh yeah? Well our dads are bigger than your dad. Grow up you big wally!’ they replied.</p>
      <p>Piers replied: ‘a) They’re not. b) I really wouldn’t play the growth card..’</p>
      <p>He then proceeded to go on a huge rant about how many more followers he has than Ant and Dec.</p>
