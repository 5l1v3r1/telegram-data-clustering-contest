      <p>News that this year’s <i>The Bachelor</i> couple <b>Matt Agnew</b> and <b>Chelsie McLeod</b> had split sent shock waves through the local celeb community and everyone is reeling, including 2019 Bachelorette <b>Angie Kent</b>.</p>
      <p>During her appearance on <i>Have You Been Paying Attention?</i>, Kent appeared to be disappointed but understanding of the demise of her fellow<i> Bachie</i> star’s relationship.</p>
      <p>“Once you get out of the <i>Bachie</i> bubble, it’s up to you then to kind of create a connection and see how it goes,” she said.</p>
      <p>She went on to discuss the “hardcore” difficulty of keeping the relationship going outside the mansion when the cameras stop rolling.</p>

      <p>Her boyfriend <b>Carlin Steritt</b> then spoke about how hard it was to keep their relationship secret after they had finished filming.</p>
      <p>“I was actually on the phone to Angie when I was in my apartment and my housemate walked through the door. And I was on loudspeaker,” he said.</p>
      <p>“He heard it straight away. And I just had that look of like, ‘I’m done’ [but it appears he didn’t find out].”</p>

      <p>He wrote:</p>
      <blockquote>These past six months since filming have been a very unique experience.<br/>Chels and I have made some beautiful memories together that I’ll always cherish, and I wish her nothing but the absolute best.<br/>However, it’s with a heavy heart that I write this. For Chels and me, our relationship hasn’t translated from filming to the real, every day world as we had hoped.<br/>Chels is a very special woman and I want her to find the happiness she deserves. For those who may wonder if there’s someone else for me right now, there absolutely is not.<br/>It’s no one’s fault, it’s just life.</blockquote>
