      <p>With only a few weeks left in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/destiny-2/39651"><i>Destiny 2</i></a>’s first season of Year 3, Bungie announced when it’ll launch the upcoming season nine for players. In <a href="https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48443">its weekly blog post</a>, the studio also revealed nerfs to two of <i>Destiny</i><i> 2</i>’s most divisive items: The Recluse submachine gun and the One-Eyed Mask Titan helmet.</p>
      <p>Bungie revealed that players will lose access to some Season of the Undying achievements and ranks during the weekly reset on Dec. 10. This coincides with the Season of the Undying’s in-game countdown clock, which states how many days players have left in the season. It appears that<i> </i><i>Destiny</i><i> 2 </i>will officially transition from season eight to season nine during that weekly reset, on Tuesday, Dec. 10. The studio still hasn’t revealed what players will spend their time on next season, although we do know it’s called Season of Dawn.</p>
      <p>In the same post, Bungie also revealed several balance changes coming at the start of season nine. The submachine gun The Recluse — which kills very quickly in Destiny’s PvE and PvP content — will finally receive a damage nerf. Titan’s Exotic One-Eyed Mask helmet will also lose the ability to grant Titans an overshield after scoring a kill.</p>
      <p>Both of these nerfs come with a <a href="https://twitter.com/A_dmg04/status/1196496422947807234?s=20">great deal of community praise</a>. One-Eyed Mask has plagued the PvP landscape for over a year — with The Recluse being the weapon to to have for nearly nine months. On top of these two nerfs, Bungie also addressed <i>Destiny 2</i>’s latest Exotic weapon: Xenophage. Xenophage isn’t as strong as players would like, and Bungie agrees. At the start of season nine, Bungie is boosting the gun’s power by 50% in PvE activities.</p>
      <p>The studio said it’ll reveal more changes coming to <i>Destiny 2 </i>with season nine over the coming weeks.</p>
