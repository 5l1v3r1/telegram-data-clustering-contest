      <p>A Lamborghini owner has been blasted by police for parking illegally in a taxi rank in the heart of Birmingham city centre.</p>
      <p>The owner of the £215,000 Huracan Performante was slapped with a £130 fine by officers from West Midlands Police after the supercar was spotted in a taxi space in  <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/birmingham-city-centre"><b>Waterloo Street, off Temple Row,</b> </a><b> </b> on Friday, November 15.</p>
      <p>Birmingham Taxi and Private Hire Officers called out the parking and publicly criticised the motorist on social media.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The expensive vehicle – which can do more than 200mph – also failed to display a front registration plate.</p>
      <p>They said: “I don’t need to blank this plate on the basis anyway – that’s two offences the owner is being prosecuted for!”</p>
      <p>Many have taken to social media to also slam the driver for their actions.</p>
      <p>One said: “A couple of hundred bucks at the most. Can’t imagine them being that bothered when they can afford a car like that.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>While another said: “Nail the plate on with a nail gun.”</p>
      <p>And a third wrote: “If they are from a reputable company or football club I'm sure they would like to know about their irresponsible behaviour.”</p>

      <p>The fine comes exactly a year after a <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/motoring/">£271,000 Aventador</a> parked in the exact same position on the same street.</p>
      <p>They tweeted: “It really does annoy me that the driver has parked on a rank – but even more so by driving through a no entry!”</p>
      <p>John Humpherson, who replied to the police's tweet, said: “I don’t suppose he will be too concerned by the fine.”</p>
      <p>But officers said the driver was ‘more concerned with it [the car] being lifted’.</p>
