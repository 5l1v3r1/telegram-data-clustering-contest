      <p>Nearly 17,000 migratory birds have died so far at the country's largest inland water saltwater lake near Jaipur due to botulism, a serious and fatal illness that affects the nerves, a forest official said on Monday.</p>
      <p>The deaths were reported in Jaipur, Nagaur and Ajmer districts of Rajasthan, he said.</p>
      <p>"The death toll has increased to nearly 17,000," Chief Wildlife Warden of the Forest Department, Arindam Tomar, said.</p>
      <p>Jaipur collector Jagroop Singh Yadav informed that carcasses have been disposed.</p>
      <p>Nearly 8,500 birds have died so far in Jaipur itself, Yadav said.</p>
      <p>Initially, it was suspected that the birds died due to avian flu but the report from a laboratory in Bhopal has ruled this out.</p>
      <p>On November 10, thousands of birds, including Northern Shoveler, Ruddy Shelduck, Plovers, Avocets, were found were found dead in the 5-7 km area around Sambhar Lake.</p>
      <p>This was the second such incident in the state within a week.</p>
