      <p>The former Afghan President Hamid Karzai blasted President Donald Trump for pardoning two U.S. soldiers accused of war crimes in Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>The office of the former president said in a statement the former president strongly condemns the pardoning of two American service members convicted in war crimes in Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>Karzai said the American government proved that it is not respecting the human values, specifically the lives of the Afghans with its recent decision.</p>
      <p>President Trump on Saturday issued pardons to U.S. military officers accused of war crimes in Afghanistan.</p>
      <p>“Today, President Donald J. Trump signed an Executive Grant of Clemency (Full Pardon) for Army First Lieutenant Clint Lorance, an Executive Grant of Clemency (Full Pardon) for Army Major Mathew Golsteyn,” the White House said in a statement on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Lieutenant Lorance was jailed for 19 years after he ordered his men to open fire on three men in 2012 in which two people were killed. He had served more than six years of the 19-year sentenced he received.</p>
      <p>Major Mathew Golsteyn was set to stand trial for an allegedly unlawful killing of a suspected Taliban bomb maker in Marjah district of Helmand province.</p>
