      <h1>New ‘Welcome to Nevada’ sign being installed at Arizona border</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:19:16+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/staff/mick-akers/" target="_blank">Mick Akers</a></address>
      <p>Motorists entering into the Silver State via Arizona will soon be welcomed by a new monument sign near the neighboring states’ border.</p>
      <p>Installation of the new $396,090 “Welcome to Nevada” monument sign began Monday along northbound Interstate 11 at the Arizona border, the Nevada Department of Transportation announced last week.</p>
      <p>The right travel lane along I-11 will close to traffic for a quarter-mile northbound from U.S. Highway 93, starting Nov. 18 and continuing through Jan. 5, according to NDOT.</p>
      <p>The nearly 20-foot-tall by 8-foot-wide plinth is constructed from materials meant to be stylish, yet rugged, such as stainless steel and concrete. The vibrant design features a pressed state silhouette with bold lettering for a distinctive gateway entry that remains lit at night via a photovoltaic panel.</p>
      <p>“The department believes that aesthetic, visually engaging monuments like the new ‘Welcome to Nevada’ signs can embody the state’s rich socio-cultural history and cultivate civic pride,” said Tony Illia, transportation department spokesman. “It additionally presents a favorable first impression, stimulating tourism, while simultaneously reflecting Nevada’s unique heritage and identity.”</p>
      <p>Work will occur from 5 a.m.-5 p.m. daily, Monday through Friday, with construction halted between Nov. 22 through Dec. 2 for Thanksgiving travelers.</p>
      <p>The special monument signs are being placed at a few major gateway locations, with the first two already up in Northern Nevada, with one along U.S. Highway 395 outside of Reno and another at Crystal Bay, Lake Tahoe.</p>
      <p>Each sign is slightly different to reflect the community’s unique character, identity and cultural history.</p>
      <p>The sign being installed just past the Hoover Dam Bridge features Art-Deco touches with a rounded top and ridged sides. Student designed “welcome” signs are still being used on other portions of Nevada highways, in addition to the gateway signs.</p>
