      <h1>Schumer pushes ban on flavored e-cigarettes</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:59:53+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:59</time> by <a rel="author">https://www.facebook.com/JerryZremskIBuffaloNews/</a></address>
      <p>Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer said Monday that with President Trump backing away from a ban on flavored electronic cigarettes, Congress must pass a bill blocking their sale.</p>
      <p>In an appearance at Depew High School, Schumer, a New York Democrat, noted that there's bipartisan legislation pending in the Senate that would enact such a ban.</p>
      <p>"And I promise you, students of Depew, that I will use all my clout as minority leader to see that this legislation passes quickly," he said. "It could be a Christmas present to our kids."</p>
      <p>Schumer's local appearance came on the same day <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/trump-pulls-back-from-flavored-vaping-ban/2019/11/17/30853ece-07ae-11ea-924a-28d87132c7ec_story.html">The Washington Post reported</a> that Trump – who proposed banning flavored e-cigarettes in September – had refused to sign a memo enacting such a ban. A Trump adviser told The Post that the president was concerned that the ban could lead to job losses.</p>
      <p>That story also said a social media campaign, built around the hashtag #IVapeIVote, had "rattled" the president. The Post reported that Brad Parscale, Trump's campaign manager, had warned him that a ban could cost him votes in battleground states as he tries to win re-election next year.</p>
      <p>Trump originally pushed such a ban amid reports that vaping had led to an outbreak of lung injuries. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 42 deaths have already been associated with e-cigarette use.</p>
      <p>That being the case, Schumer said the federal government can't wait to ban the flavored vaping products that are most popular with young people, which include flavors like bubblegum and cookies and cream.</p>
      <p>"If we are going to tackle the all-out crisis of youth vaping and the flavor explosion fueling addiction and related health issues, we must get these flavors off the shelves, full stop,” Schumer said. “That’s why I’m proud to push a new two-pronged approach to curb youth e-cigarette use by sponsoring legislation to ban kid-friendly flavors and calling for a coordinated, national educational campaign and strategy to warn children of the serious dangers of these products."</p>
      <p>Schumer noted that among high schoolers nationwide, the rate of e-cigarette use skyrocketed from 11% in 2016 to 28% only two years later.</p>
      <p>New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has tried to ban flavored e-cigarettes, only to find his move stopped by a state appeals court.</p>
      <p>Meantime, the vaping industry has fought back hard against all such proposals.</p>
      <p>“In the history of the United States, prohibition has never worked," said Gregory Conley, president of the American Vaping Association, in reaction to Trump's proposed ban. "It didn’t work with alcohol. It hasn’t worked with marijuana. It won’t work with e-cigarettes."</p>
