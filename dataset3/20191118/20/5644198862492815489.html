      <p>"I would urge those rioters, do not try to escalate the level of weapons or violence. We have the capabilities. I will once again urge them to come out, surrender," said regional commander of Kowloon West, Cheuk Hau-Yip.</p>
      <p>"As if they always claimed they want to fight for a better future, then please come out and face the consequences of your actions and uphold the rule of law of Hong Kong."</p>
      <p>Police said a media liaison officer was treated in hospital after being hit by an arrow in the leg.</p>

      <p>"I have one fellow officer shot by arrow already. This is a very long-range weapon used by the rioters. If we have to respond, I believe the only option is to use deadly weapons," Cheuk said.</p>
      <p>Wok Ka-Chuen, Chief Superintendent of the Police Public Relations Branch, added: "Without a doubt, this is a murderous act. There are many reporters in the same area. The arrow could have killed our officer or anyone in the surroundings. </p>
      <p>"We express our strongest condemnation against this indiscriminate violence."</p>
