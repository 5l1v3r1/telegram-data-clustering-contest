      <h1>Police: Argentinian Woman Hid 9 Pounds of Pot Inside ‘Baby Bump’</h1>
      <h2>A woman in Argentina making her way to the Chilean border had nine pounds of pot hidden inside a fake wearable stomach to make it look like she was carrying a child, police said.</h2>

      <p>Argentinian officials say the “narco pregnancy” <a href="https://abc7chicago.com/5701170/">consisted</a> of 15 bricks of weed inside the fake belly. The woman was traveling with a group near the Chilean border at a checkpoint near Mendoza when officials caught them.</p>
      <p>Authorities initially searched a man in the group and discovered marijuana in his bag, which led officials to search the woman with the fake belly.</p>
      <p>“She made a belly out of paste, hid 15 cannabis bricks inside it, and faked a pregnancy before trying to take it from Mendoza to Santa Cruz,” Argentina’s Minister for Security Patricia Bullrich <a href="https://twitter.com/PatoBullrich/status/1194707663206125568?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1194707663206125568&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.news18.com%2Fnews%2Fbuzz%2Fpregnant-woman-caught-smuggling-4-kg-cannabis-inside-fake-baby-bump-in-argentina-2386857.html">tweeted</a> along with photos Wednesday.</p>

      <p>A police spokesman <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/drug-smuggler-hid-four-kilos-cannabis-fake-baby-bump-11147786/">told</a> Metro UK that the woman was “asked to leave the [bus] and it was confirmed she was also carrying drugs and no baby inside of her.”</p>
      <p>The special delivery turned out to weigh four kilos, and authorities charged the Argentinian woman with drug-smuggling.</p>
      <p>Authorities say she and the man were headed to Patagonia.</p>
