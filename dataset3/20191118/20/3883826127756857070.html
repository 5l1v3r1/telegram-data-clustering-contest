        <b>Somerset have been docked 24 points after being found guilty of preparing a "poor" pitch for last season's County Championship decider against Essex.</b>
      </p>
      <p>A hearing at Lord's found the wicket prepared for the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/49841072">September</a> match had "excessive unevenness of bounce".</p>
      <p>The points deduction will take effect in the 2020 Championship season, but 12 points are suspended for two years.</p>
      <p>Somerset have 14 days to appeal against the decision by the England and Wales Cricket Board commission.</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.somersetcountycc.co.uk/news/club-news/club-statement-cricket-discipline-commission-decision/">statement on the club website</a> said: "Somerset await the full report from the cricket discipline commission before considering our next course of action."</p>
      <p>Somerset drew their rain-affected Division One match against Essex, a result which handed the visitors the Championship title.</p>
      <p>Following an investigation, Somerset were charged with a breach of the regulation which requires that: "Each county shall actively seek to prepare the best quality cricket pitch that it can for the match that it is staging".</p>
      <p>Somerset accepted a pitch rating of "poor" was correct, but pleaded not guilty to a second element of the charge that the Taunton surface "was not the best quality pitch that Somerset was able to prepare for the match".</p>
