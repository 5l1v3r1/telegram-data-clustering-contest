      <blockquote>
        <b>
          <i>“[The idea to return to NXT] came to be a couple of months ago. Things weren’t going kind of as smoothly – well, I don’t want to say ‘as smoothly’. I just wasn’t happy where I was at on RAW and SmackDown, I had a conversation with Hunter, we pinged some ideas back and forth, I took a little time off and came back in NXT. It’s all been awesome since.”</i>

      <p>Finn admitted that things didn’t turn out exactly how he planned when joining the main roster. But he is grateful for the opportunity to be on <i>RAW</i> and <i>SmackDown</i> and to have learned so much from it.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>
          <i>“I wouldn’t change anything because I learned so much. It’s almost like a growing process; you have to go through those growing pains to get to where I am now.” <br/></i>
        </b>
        <b>
          <i>“And everyone’s been through those times in their career, and everybody’s been through s–tty times in their lives. And I don’t want to say it was a s–tty time but it was a time that looking back now, I learned more than anything on those three years on RAW and SmackDown.”</i>

      <p>Finn made it clear on what his current goals are now that he is on the NXT roster once again.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <b>
          <i>“Trust me, I know what I’ve done in this business, and I know what I’ve achieved, and I’ve achieved more than most people can ever imagine but it’s time now to restart as Finn in NXT. It’s time to re-assess everything, take stock of everything that I’ve done for the last nineteen, twenty years, put it all together, put it into something I believe in and invested in, and put it out there as creatively as I can.”</i>
        </b>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Finn Balor is currently in a program with Matt Riddle and will go one on one with him at <i>NXT: Wargames </i>on Saturday, November 23, live on the WWE Network.</p>
