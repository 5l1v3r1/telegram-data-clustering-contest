      <p>Around 12,000 students from across Kozhikode district will slug it out at 18 venues in the city from Tuesday as the four-day on-stage competitions for the school arts festival will kick off here. Transport Minister A.K. Saseendran will open the festival at the main stage at B.E.M. Girls Higher Secondary School at 4 p.m.</p>
      <p>A ‘proclamation procession’ was taken out on Monday evening from the school to S.M. Street to mark the beginning of the festival. A flash mob was presented around S.K. Square by students of Government Vocational Higher Secondary School, Nadakkavu. The organisers said around 350 events would be held across various venues. Around 200 students have managed to get permission from the authorities by appealing against the results at the sub-district level. Food counters have been set up at the Government Model Higher Secondary School. Green protocol will be followed. The names of all the venues are linked to Mahatma Gandhi to mark his 150th birth anniversary.</p>
      <p>The off-stage events had concluded on Friday. Minister for Excise and Labour T.P. Ramakrishnan will open the valedictory event on November 22, the organisers added.</p>
