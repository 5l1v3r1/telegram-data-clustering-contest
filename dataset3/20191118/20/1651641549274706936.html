      <h1>Ubisoft and Tencent are working together to bring Rainbow Six Siege to China</h1>

        <b>Despite the fact that <a href="https://mspoweruser.com/sex-and-gambling-references-are-getting-wiped-from-rainbow-6-siege-2/">backlash from fans last year caused Ubisoft to re-implement sex and gambling references in Rainbow Six Siege</a>, the company is now working with Tencent in order to bring the game to China.</b>
      </p>
      <p>According to <a href="https://www.theloadout.com/rainbow-six-siege/china-tencent">an article from The Loadout</a>, Ubisoft’s EMEA eSport director Francois-Xavier Deniele confirmed that Ubisoft is excited to bring the game to China and that the company is being careful to ensure that integration is done properly.</p>
      <p>Deniele is quoted as saying the following:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <i>“China, it’s something very important for me, and for Siege. I’m working a lot of the introduction of China at this point, because when it happens it’s going to be a huge step that changes not just for the state of the game, but also for the eSports scene, because there’s such a huge market.”<br/></i>
        <i>“We’re working right now with our partner Tencent to publish the game in China. We’re waiting for approval from the government right now and hoping to get that sorted.”<br/></i>
        <i>“We need to be careful to not destroy everything we are doing with Rainbow Six Siege along the way, so a lot of all of our jobs right now is working on how we will get the Chinese market into the scene, not just for the game, but also into our eSports plans.”</i>
      </blockquote>
      <p>It’s likely that, given that Rainbow Six Siege is once again attempting to make its way to China, the Chinese version of the game will once again have its sex, gambling, and violence references removed.</p>
      <p>You can see changes that were previously made (before fan backlash caused Ubisoft to revert them) below. Examples include the complete removal of slot machines, the removal of blood from a painting, and the changing of a neon sign from a woman posing provocatively to a pointing hand.</p>

      <p>At the time, fans claimed that this censorship was ‘needless’ as it was purely aesthetic as the core mechanics of Rainbow Six Siege, which mostly consist of shooting other players, remained the same. What changes will be made to the game this time round have yet to be seen.</p>
