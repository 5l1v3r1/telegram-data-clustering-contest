      <p>These grotesque photos of lice-infested eyelash extensions are enough to make anyone’s skin crawl.</p>
      <p>As fake lashes grow in popularity, optometrists are warning people about the spread of ‘lash lice,’ which have been on the rise as wearers fail to observe proper hygiene procedures.</p>
      <p>Experts said many people who get eyelash extensions are afraid the wash them due to fears that they might fall out, leading to bacteria buildup, infection – or creepy crawlies.</p>
      <p>Eyelash lice, which are medically refereed to as demodex, are organisms that live on hair follicle and can be transferred to anyone. While the method of contracting the lice is similar, demodex are a different species to the more common head lice which makes its home in human hair.  just like typical head lice, but they are not the same creature found in head lice cases, according to Dr Gary Keoleian at the Michigan Eye Institute.</p>

      <p>Dr Gary Keoleian from the Michigan Eye Institute told ABC12: ‘Really what’s being called lice online and on social media right now are actually a form of mite called demodex and that’s where the concern is.’</p>

      <p>Demodex, which is a nearly microscopic parasitic organism, is actually something everyone has, Keoleian said, but problems arrive when bacteria builds up on the fake lashes.</p>
      <p>‘Over time, dirt and debris can accumulate. When it accumulates, that’s when you start getting into irritation. Demodex can infest, bacteria can take root, then you have irritation and you’re picking at your lashes and it’s a whole cycle,’ he continued.</p>
      <p>Dr Sairah Malik told ABC 7: ‘Generally the idea when you have eyelash extensions is that people are afraid to kind of touch them or wash them because they’re afraid the eyelash will fall out.’</p>
      <p>Dr Malik said that cleaning your eyelids is critical to stop the buildup of bacteria that lead to lash lice.</p>
      <p>‘We recommend tea tree base cleanser. Any cleanser that has a diluted form of tea tree, and it’s a good idea to use on a daily basis,’ she said.</p>
      <p>Experts also said that taking an occasional break from eyelash extensions can be beneficial for eye health.</p>
