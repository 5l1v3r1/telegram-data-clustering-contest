      <p>Former Towie star Lucy Mecklenburgh showed off her baby bump at the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/strictly-come-dancing/">Strictly Come Dancing</a> after party in Blackpool on Saturday night.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/strictly-come-dancing/">Strictly</a> stars let their hair down and partied until the early hours of Sunday morning… some reportedly leaving the venue at 5am.</p>
      <p>Lucy, whose baby is due around January next year, waltzed into the venue wearing a stunning black jumpsuit and showing off her baby bump.</p>
      <p>She linked arms with fiance Ryan Thomas, looking cute in a simple black tee, jacket, ripped jeans and white trainer combo.</p>
      <p>Lisa Armstrong didn’t look like she was letting the claims of a bitter divorce between her and Ant McPartlin get to her, arriving at the after party looking ready to party.</p>
      <p>Sporting leather trousers, high heel boots and a beautiful green flowing top, the star completed the look by wrapping a sparkly black scarf around her neck.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Strictly host Tess Daly went for a silver look, with oversized grey trousers and matching jacket, paired with grey and black leopard print flats.</p>
      <p>She was clearly ready to break it down with the Strictly crew on the dance floor and judging by their Instagram accounts, that’s exactly what they did.</p>

      <p>Fellow host Claudia Winkleman took to Instagram to show her enthusiasm for the evening.</p>
      <p>She posted a series of photos with Tess and some pretty hilarious captions.</p>
      <p>One simply read: ‘Sorry Blackpool’, while another read: ‘Leopard print in Blackpool is mandatory.’</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Tess kept it more professional with the comment: ‘What a weekend that was! Hope you all enjoyed Blackpool as much as we did.’</p>

      <p>Other celebrities present include judge host Motsi Mabuse, who looked stunning in a pair of silver strappy heels, sparkly slit dress and coat.</p>
      <p>We wish we were there to see her whip that coat off and run to the dance floor.</p>
      <p>The after party comes about after the shock elimination of RuPaul’s Drag Race host Michelle Visage from the latest episode of Strictly Come Dancing.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>She shared a <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/michelle-visage-defends-risky-voguing-routine-strictly-come-dancing-exit-11172458/">heartfelt message to Instagram</a> after Sunday’s results show and said that she was ‘proud’ to leave the show on their couple’s choice routine.</p>

      <p>The 51-year-old explained: ‘We are SO proud of the dance we did, but for me, it wasn’t about judges scores. It was about shedding light on a group of people who deserve recognition and would otherwise not get it.</p>
      <p>‘I owe my life to the LGBTQIA+ community so as an ally, I try to bring attention to them, their love, their struggles, in any way that I am able to.</p>
      <p>‘In this instance it happened to be through dance and hear this: Voguing IS dancing.’</p>
      <p>Michelle and Giovanni found themselves in the dance off with Saffron Barker and AJ Pritchard.</p>
