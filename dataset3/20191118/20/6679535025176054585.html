      <p>The parents of three-month-old Prince Rajbhar, who lost his arm in a fire at KEM Hospital, met Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation Commissioner Praveen Pardeshi on Monday. However, Prince’s father, Pannelal Rajbhar, refused to accept the cheque of ₹5 lakh that Mr. Pardeshi offered to him.</p>
      <p>Mr. Rajbhar said Mr. Pardeshi then sent the cheque through KEM Hospital’s dean Dr. Hemant Deshmukh. “But I refused to take it even then,” said Mr. Rajbhar. He demanded that the officials responsible for the negligence be pulled up. “We also urged the BMC commissioner to provide us with a job. I have been in Mumbai for long and my employer has hired another person in my position,” he said. BJP leader R. Tamil Selvan had accompanied the parents during the meeting with Mr. Pardeshi.</p>
      <p>The family demanded a fire safety audit and installation of CCTV cameras in paediatric wards. “We want better compensation to secure the child’s future,” said Satiram Rajbhar, the child’s uncle. On November 7, an ECG cable caught fire, causing severe burns to the baby.</p>
