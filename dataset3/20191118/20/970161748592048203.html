        <b>Val Kilmer looked healthy and happy during an appearance at his own art studio exhibition after battling throat cancer for two years.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 59-year-old attended the exhibition at HelMel studios in Los Angeles on Friday after slowly returning to the spotlight since getting surgery on his throat.</p>
      <p>Val was posing with artist Tamie Adaya as he rocked his a scarf covering his throat, a colourful flannel shirt and jeans.</p>
      <p>His appearance comes after news broke of the actor starring alongside <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tom-cruise/">Tom Cruise</a> in Top Gun 2, where he will reprise his role as Iceman, which hits cinemas next summer.</p>
      <p>The actor admitted he had been secretly battling throat cancer for two years in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter in 2017.</p>
      <p>He had a procedure on his trachea that made his voice raspy and left him short of breath.</p>
      <p>The disease took a huge toll on the Tombstone actor but he believes his Christian Scientist faith and the chemotherapy helped him fight his cancer.</p>

      <p>It looks the actor is slowly getting better, and we are excited to watch him return to our screens.</p>
      <p>Joseph Kosinski – who is directing Top Gun: Maverick – has <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/02/maverick-star-val-kilmer-takes-stage-cancer-battle-appears-top-gun-screening-10669521/">previously teased fans about what they can expect</a> from the follow-up.</p>
      <p>Hinting that that film will focus on Maverick’s time in the modern armed forces, he recently said: ‘The Navy is very different now than it was in 1986. Back then, they hadn’t been in any war for 15 or 20 years at that point.</p>
      <p>‘Now, here in 2017, the Navy’s been at war for 20 years. It’s just a different world now, so you can’t remake the first movie. It has to adapt.’</p>
