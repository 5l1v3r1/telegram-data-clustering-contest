      <h1>Freddie Kitchens Was Asked If Myles Garrett Was ‘Provoked’</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:16:09+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/tzvimachlin" target="_blank">Tzvi Machlin</a></address>
      <p>Cleveland Browns defensive end Myles Garrett is personally meeting with NFL officials to appeal the indefinite suspension he got for swinging a helmet at Mason Rudolph.</p>
      <p>The issues has been divisive, but Garrett has not been lacking for allies.</p>
      <p>Browns head coach Freddie Kitchens can count himself among Garrett’s supporters, though. He was asked on Monday if he felt that Garrett was “provoked” by the Steelers quarterback.</p>
      <p>But rather than directly answer the question, Kitchens directed skeptics to view the tape. Kitchens said that he is “here to support Myles” and maintains that Garrett is a good person and “part of our family.”</p>
      <blockquote>“Everybody here saw the tape. You saw the tape. I’m here to support Myles. Myles is a good person. He’s part of our family”</blockquote>

      <p>In the waning seconds of Thursday night’s game against the Steelers, <a href="https://thespun.com/more/top-stories/mason-rudolph-wont-take-legal-action-myles-garrett">Garrett wrestled Rudolph to the ground on a passing play.</a></p>
      <p>There was a scrum while they were on the ground and Garrett emerged from the pile with Rudolph’s helmet. When Rudolph charged at Garrett, the Browns pass rusher swung it, grazing the quarterback’s head.</p>
      <p>That action caused a small brawl to erupt onto the field that resulted in several suspensions on both teams.</p>
