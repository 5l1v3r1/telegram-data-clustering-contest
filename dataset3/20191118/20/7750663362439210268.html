      <h1>Michael O'Neill confident Northern Ireland have faced their toughest tests</h1>
      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/michael-oneill/"><b>Michael O'Neill</b></a> believes <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/northern-ireland/"><b>Northern Ireland</b></a> are moving in the right direction despite missing out on automatic qualification for <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/euro-2020/"><b>Euro 2020</b></a>.</h2>

      <p>The Green and White Army play their final Group C fixture on Tuesday when they face <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/football/germany/"><b>Germany</b></a> in Frankfurt, but attention is already shifting to the play-offs in March after Saturday's goalless draw with Holland ended any chance of advancing directly.</p>
      <p>That Northern Ireland could not match their achievement of reaching Euro 2016 out of a group that included the Dutch and Germans is no surprise, and O'Neill sees no failure in that.</p>

      <p>"Of course we were in a position to take more points, but people have to be realistic with the level of the opposition that we're playing against," he said.</p>
      <p>"For most of our players it is a huge step up. For us to get to the finals ahead of Germany and Holland, I'm not sure how many other teams in Europe would be capable of doing that.</p>
      <p>"We have a route through the play-offs and the good thing for us there won't be anyone in the play-offs at the level of Germany and Holland."</p>
      <p>As it stands, Northern Ireland look likely to face Bosnia and Herzegovina away from home in March, though the picture could yet change.</p>

      <p>If Hungary can beat Wales on Tuesday to qualify automatically, Northern Ireland could yet get a home fixture but the outcome will not be known until Friday's draw in Nyon.</p>
      <p>O'Neill plans to stay on and take charge of those play-offs alongside his new role as Stoke manager, though inevitably speculation is already rife as to who will eventually replace him.</p>
      <p>O'Neill is expected to play a role in deciding his successor and is certain he will be handing over a team on the rise.</p>

      <p>"There has been an influx of new players, relatively-inexperienced players who have been asked to play international football at a very early stage of their club careers," he said.</p>
      <p>"How those players have adapted to that is testament to the likes of Craig (Cathcart), Jonny (Evans) and (Steven Davis).</p>
      <p>"They have been the backbone of the consistency of the team and have made it easier for those younger players who have come in.</p>
      <p>"I think we're in a good place. If you look at our qualification record... before we played Germany in September, it was over 60 per cent in terms of our win ratio, so for a country like Northern Ireland to have that win ratio in qualification games is extremely pleasing.</p>

      <p>"We just have to try and maintain this level. We hope that in future UEFA is a little bit kinder to us when they pull the balls out of the pots, and we get a better draw but otherwise, the team is going in the right direction."</p>
      <p>Craig Cathcart stands to earn his 50th cap in Tuesday's match, though his regular defensive partner <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jonny-evans/"><b>Jonny Evans</b></a> could miss out after suffering with an illness.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/jamal-lewis/"><b>Jamal Lewis</b></a> has already been ruled out, having returned to Norwich for assessment on a knee injury suffered on Saturday.</p>
