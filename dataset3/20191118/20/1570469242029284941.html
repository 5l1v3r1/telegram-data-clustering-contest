      <p>Three people lost their lives in a shooting on Monday at a Walmart store in Duncan, Oklahoma, multiple media reports said.</p>
      <p>According to a report, the shooting took place outside the store and the suspect is one of those killed.</p>
      <p>Schools in the area had been placed on lockdown temporarily before being given an "all clear" by local police, according to a Facebook statement from Duncan Public Schools.</p>
      <p>Duncan is a town of roughly 22,000 people located about 80 miles (129 km) south of Oklahoma City.</p>
      <p>The violence comes on the heels of a shooting in Fresno, California, that saw at least four killed as people gathered in a backyard to watch a football game, with at least one shooter still unaccounted for.</p>
      <p>California was also hit by a school shooting in Santa Clarita last week in which a 16-year-old boy shot and killed two classmates before turning the gun on himself, and a San Diego shooting on Saturday that saw a man kill his estranged wife and three of their young sons before killing himself.</p>
