      <h1>The big mistake Raul Sanllehi and Unai Emery made in the summer that is hurting Arsenal now</h1>
      <h2>Emery is coming under increasing pressure from Arsenal supporters due to his side's poor run of form</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:00</time> by <a rel="author">Connor O'Neill</a></address>
      <p>Former Arsenal defender Matthew Upson believes Unai Emery's biggest mistake at the club was trying to change things too quickly.</p>
      <p>Emery took over at the Emirates in the summer of 2018, succeeding Arsene Wenger who had been at the helm for 22 years.</p>
      <p>But despite spending big in the summer, the Gunners currently lie in sixth in the Premier League table - a staggering 17 points behind leaders Liverpool.</p>
      <p>And Upson believes the former PSG boss may have already lost the dressing room given how poor his side have been performing in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>"Maybe, maybe that's the case," the former England international told BBC Radio 5 Live. "Maybe there's already a loss of belief or whatever it may be in the manager.</p>
      <p>"Emery came to the club and he tried to change things, he tried to be more disciplined.</p>
      <p>“Again you have to look at the recruitment, don't you? To spend what they have spent on an attacking wide player, with the other issues that need to be addressed in the team.</p>

      <p>"I thought he had a decent first season. At the end of last season you thought: 'You have to progress next season' but I don't think they have."</p>
      <p>Before Upson continued: "A loss to Southampton [leaves Emery] in real limbo because I think he's struggling. I was at Leicester and I saw a really poor performance from Arsenal.</p>
      <p>"It was almost like they tried to cater to not get beaten at Leicester who were on top form, and this is Arsenal, and never really got any kind of grip on the game."</p>
