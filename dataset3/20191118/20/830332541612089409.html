      <p>(CNN) - In case you were wondering, Idris Elba is "doing OK."</p>
      <p>The torch for <a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/entertainment/2019/11/13/john-legend-peoples-sexiest-man-alive-es-sot-vpx.cnn">"People's Sexist Man Alive"</a> has been passed from Elba to John Legend, but the actor tells CNN his title stands.</p>
      <p>"I am doing OK," Elba joked to CNN. "You have to understand, it says the "Sexiest Man <i>Alive.</i>" As long as I am alive, I am still the sexiest right? So, there you go."</p>
      <p>Elba was a good sport about Legend being named this year's "Sexiest Man."</p>
      <p>"My G. Congratulations brother !!! You deserve it," he tweeted last week. "DO NOT TELL @TheRock He still thinks he's got the title, I didn't have the heart to tell him when I took it."</p>
      <p>Legend has been humble, tweeting, "1995 John would be very perplexed to be following 2018 @IdrisElba as #SexiestManAlive. Hell, 2019 John is about as equally perplexed but thank you @People for finding me sexy. I'll take it."</p>
      <p>Legend's wife Teigen joked that she would like to see a picture of Elba from 1995.</p>
      <p>"Yeah but let's see an @idriselba pic from 1995 (prob still very hot)."</p>
      <p>And Elba supplied the goods.</p>
      <p>But let's face it, the next sexist man is already in line -- Snoop Dogg.</p>
