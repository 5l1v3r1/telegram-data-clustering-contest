      <p>Fans are already loving Nadine on the show, but some have been struggling to understand her accent, so where is Nadine from?</p>
      <h3>Where is Nadine Coyle from?</h3>
      <p>An Irish singer and performer, Nadine is originally from from Londonderry, also known as Derry, in Northern Ireland.</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old star moved to the UK after she found fame in Girls Aloud, the girl group that was formed after the final of Popstars: The Rivals in November 2002.</p>

      <p>Nadine moved over to America in 2008 to work after Girls Aloud split and lived there for eight years. As a result, despite the fact that she has an Irish accent, the star does also have a slight American-twang when she speaks.</p>

      <p>Nadine moved back to her native Northern Ireland from the US with her daughter in 2016.</p>
      <p>Talking to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/lorraine-kelly/">Lorraine Kelly</a> in January 2018 about her accent, Nadine said: ‘With my accent, whenever I slowdown, which I try to do on TV, otherwise the tweets will be saying ‘what is she talking about’…and when I slow it down I think it does get a bit of an American twang going on.’</p>

      <p>Despite some fans saying they have struggled to understand the star’s accent, others are thrilled to see someone from Derry on the show.</p>
      <p>‘Absolutely so proud of @NadineCoyleNow,’ tweeted on viewer. ‘ As a Derry boy it’s amazing to see someone from my home town doing so well.’</p>
