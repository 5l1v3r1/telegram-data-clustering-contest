      <h1>Coronation Street fans notice something strange in Daniel and Sinead's flat</h1>
      <h2>Viewers couldn't believe what they were seeing</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:08:30+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/authors/sophie-mccoid/" target="_blank">Sophie McCoid</a></address>
      <p>Coronation Street fans watched the street gather to say goodbye to Sinead in tonight's episode, but before the funeral they noticed something strange in her and Daniel's flat.</p>
      <p>Daniel finally returned to the street with son Bertie, after running away after struggling to cope with <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/katie-mcglynn-shows-amazing-transformation-17272141">Sinead's loss.</a></p>
      <p>Daniel walked into the flat for the first time in over a week and his eyes were drawn to his laptop on the table, that displayed a photo of him, Sinead and Bertie on their wedding day.</p>

      <p>The touching photo was taken shortly before Sinead's death, after she lost her battle with cervical cancer.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/itv-coronation-streets-beverley-callard-17272426">viewers</a> were more confused by the fact that the laptop still had power, after being left on for days without being plugged in.</p>
      <p>And lots of fans took to twitter following <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/itv-coronation-street-fans-claim-17266906">the blunder.</a></p>
      <p>Andrew said: "Christ where did Daniel get that laptop battery"</p>

      <p>Adam Saunders said: "BLUNDER ALERT: I’m right thinking nobody has been in Daniel’s flat since he went away. Now he’s back, his laptop has been charged up all this time?"</p>
      <p>Despite Daniel saying he wasn't going to the funeral he was eventually persuaded by Beth to go and to take Bertie with him as well.</p>
      <p>But as they were at the funeral the episode ended with a burglar in their flat stealing the laptop - sure to leave Daniel heartbroken.</p>
