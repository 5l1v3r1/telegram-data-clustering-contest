      <p>An episode of The Crown has sparked a fierce reaction from viewers - with dozens expressing shock over how the Aberfan disaster is not better known.</p>
      <p>Olivia Colman is the new star of the Netflix show, with the third season seeing one episode based on the 1966 Aberfan coal-tip disaster, in which 144 people died, 116 of them children.</p>
      <p>The third episode of the new series covers the story of the colliery spoil tip, which collapsed and engulfed Pantglas Junior School and surrounding homes on October 21, 1966.</p>
      <p>The events have never previously been dramatised for television - 2016's Green Hollow was a visualised poem featuring voices of those touched by the disaster, scripted by Owen Sheers - and at the time of filming The Crown's production company, Left Bank Pictures, said it aimed to "tell this story truthfully and responsibly so that the tragic events of 1966 are never forgotten."</p>
      <p>Producers for the series met community leaders and locals to discuss research and their approach to the disaster.</p>

      <p>Elizabeth Ammon tweeted: "Looking at the comments about The Crown, I am horrified how many people didn’t know about the Aberfan disaster. I remember my parents telling me about it at a very young age. I wish we’d teach our kids more recent history rather than the ruddy Tudors all the time."</p>
      <p>@hisdoryan added: "Quite sad that I've had more exposure to the Aberfan disaster in 45 mins of The Crown than I ever did at school. And I know I'm not the only one.This is why <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/welshhistory?src=hashtag_click">#welshhistory</a> must be taught in schools."</p>

      <p>Lisa Childs added: " <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheCrown?src=hashtag_click">#TheCrown</a> Aberfan ep is masterful. Don’t recommend watching if you’re feeling fragile. Sobbing. Now the world will remember the 144 lives taken by neglect; remember the 116 children who didn’t come home. But why did it take a TV show? Why isn’t Welsh history taught? Fe gofiwn."</p>
      <p>And Jack Parry-Jones wrote: "I'm very proud to have played a role in the Aberfan episode of the Crown. I grew up a stone throw away from Aberfan and it meant the world to me to help tell that story. It's a tragic but important part of Welsh history and deserves this global platform. Please watch it."</p>
      <p>And Eira continued: "It's appalling that so few people know about <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Aberfan?src=hashtag_click">#Aberfan</a> . 144 buried alive by the National Coal Board. Ep.3 of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/thecrown3?src=hashtag_click">#thecrown3</a> should be mandatory viewing. This is what happens when profit is valued above people's lives, same with Grenfell and will happen again. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/neverforget?src=hashtag_click">#neverforget</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/cymruambyth?src=hashtag_click">#cymruambyth</a> "</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“Watched three episodes of series 3 so far. Aberfan brought back memories. It is shocking what the Establishment was like in those day,” another wrote.</p>
      <p>Another added: “Queen to Harold Wilson - Are you saying I let the side down by not visiting Aberfan? WOW, JUST WOW!”</p>
      <p>A third ranted: “I grew up just outside of Aberfan and I remember the disaster as if it were yesterday and one thing I can tell you is that the people of that village were treated abysmally by the Establishment, Royalty and the rest of them.”</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>The third season will cover 1964-1977, set against the backdrop of the miners' strikes, the country's economic crisis, and national security threats, as well as the tenure of Harold Wilson as prime minister, the investiture of the Prince of Wales, and the Queen's Silver Jubilee.</p>
