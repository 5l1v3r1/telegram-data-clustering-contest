      <p>The Pydhonie police have arrested the mother and brother of a 23-year-old woman, who was found murdered at her house in Masjid Bunder on Sunday morning.</p>
      <p>According to the Pydhonie police, Tapu Waghela (40) walked into the police station and surrendered herself at 12.30 p.m.</p>
      <p>The police said Ms. Waghela told them that she had strangled her daughter, Nirmal, to death in their house on Bharuch Street. The police then rushed a team to the house and found Nirmal lying motionless on the floor. She was rushed to JJ Hospital, where she was declared dead before admission.</p>
      <p>The police interrogated Ms. Waghela on the sequence of events leading up to the murder. Ms. Waghela allegedly confessed that she killed Nirmal as she was in a relationship that she did not approve of. The police said the incident took place between 9 a.m. and 12.30 p.m.</p>
      <p>An officer with the Pydhonie police said, “Nirmal was fed up with her mother’s constant opposition to her relationship and started packing her clothes on Sunday morning. She told Ms. Waghela that she was going to leave the house forever. This led to a heated argument and Ms. Waghela along with her son, Akash, strangled Nirmal to death using one of her dupattas.”</p>
      <p>Ms. Waghela and her son were placed under arrest and charged with murder under the Indian Penal Code. Senior police inspector Subhash Dudhgaokar of Pydhonie police station confirmed the arrests. He said the accused have been remanded in police custody till November 23.</p>
