      <h1>Amazon deforestation at worst since 2008, Brazil says</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:46:34+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:46</time> by <a rel="author">ASSOCIATED PRESS</a></address>
      <p>The rate of deforestation in Brazil's Amazon rainforest is at its highest level in more than a decade, according to a government report published on Monday.</p>
      <p>Deforestation between August 2018 and July 2019 reached 9,762 square kilometers (3,769 square miles), a 30% increase over the previous year, Brazil's National Institute for Space Research said.</p>
      <p>The area of deforestation is the largest recorded since 2008 and is about the size of the U.S. states of Delaware and Rhode Island combined.</p>
      <p>The Brazilian state of Para accounted for nearly 40% of all deforestation during the 2018-19 period, but illegal logging increased markedly in the states of Roraima and Amazonas, officials said.</p>
      <p>The report is preliminary, and its data will be confirmed next year.</p>
      <p>"It is unacceptable that the Amazon is still being destroyed," the WWF conservation group said in a statement. It said deforestation will accelerate unless the Brazilian government takes robust action to prevent it.</p>
      <p>Concern about the Amazon heightened after President Jair Bolsonaro took office in January. His administration has advocated the loosening of protections around natural reserves and indigenous lands as a way to promote economic development.</p>
      <p>In July and August, fires in the Amazon spread at a pace unseen since 2010, before slowing in September. Farmers, developers and others often use fire to clear deforested land, for soy production or pastures.</p>
      <p>Some European leaders have argued that the fires in the Amazon required a global response because of the ecosystem's critical role in draining heat-trapping carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.</p>
      <p>The Brazilian government has accused France and Germany of infringing on its sovereignty and says it is taking steps to reduce deforestation. As fires raged a few months ago, Bolsonaro sent the military to help battle some blazes and banned most legal fires for land-clearing in the Amazon for two months.</p>
      <p>Environment Minister Ricardo Salles will meet the Amazon region's governors Thursday to discuss efforts to contain deforestation. Salles says illegal mining, logging and land-grabbing cause most deforestation.</p>
