      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/taylor-swift/">Taylor Swift</a> will be able to perform tracks from her back catalogue during next week’s <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/american-music-awards/">American Music Awards</a> after reaching a deal with Scott Borchetta and Scooter Braun.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/06/30/taylor-swift-accuses-scooter-braun-incessant-manipulative-bullying-buys-back-catalogue-300million-10094085/">drama between Taylor and the owner of her former record label</a>, Scott, was reignited last week after the Bad Blood singer claimed she was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/taylor-swift-reignites-scooter-braun-feud-encourages-fans-go-manager-claims-blocked-performing-songs-11148397/">no longer being allowed to perform her own music</a>.</p>
      <p>However, Big Machine, the label now owned by Taylor’s long time nemesis Scooter Braun, has now reached an agreement allowing the singer to perform her music at the AMAs, where she is being honoured as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/30/taylor-swift-named-artist-decade-amas-bow-11012992/">Artist of the Decade</a>.</p>
      <p>In a statement given to <a href="https://variety.com/2019/music/news/taylor-swift-amas-big-machine-dick-clark-productions-reach-agreement-1203408043/">Variety</a>, a representative for the label said: ‘The Big Machine Label Group and Dick Clark Productions announce that they have come to terms on a licensing agreement that approves their artists’ performances to stream post show and for re-broadcast on mutually approved platforms. This includes the upcoming American Music Awards performances.’</p>

      <p>However, continuing their previous defence that the company had <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/big-machine-records-denies-taylor-swift-music-ban-claims-11163830/">never stopped Tay-Tay from performing these songs</a>, the statement went on.</p>
      <p>‘It should be noted that recording artists do not need label approval for live performances on television or any other live media,’ it read.</p>

      <p>‘Record label approval is only needed for contracted artists’ audio and visual recordings and in determining how those works are distributed.’</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/26/taylor-swift-keeps-bad-blood-going-scooter-braun-scott-borchetta-masters-sale-10631417/">public feud between Taylor and Scooter Braun</a>, who <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/justin-bieber-breaks-silence-taylor-swifts-drama-scooter-braun-feud-rumbles-11165772/">manages Justin Bieber</a>, began back in June when the Grammy-winning star called the music mogul out for <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/06/30/taylor-swift-accuses-scooter-braun-incessant-manipulative-bullying-buys-back-catalogue-300million-10094085/">buying her back catalogue of music</a> when he had only ‘bullied’ her in the past.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/taylor-swifts-old-record-label-forced-close-early-death-threats-11171850/">Big Machine</a> previously owned the singer’s albums, which included every single, photo and asset up until and including 2017’s Reputation record.</p>
      <p>Following the sale to Scooter, Taylor revealed that she plans on following in the footsteps of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/12/21/jojo-has-re-recorded-her-entire-debut-album-and-ours-wigs-are-gone-8273185/">noughties pop icon JoJo</a> and<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/21/taylor-swift-re-record-old-music-scooter-braun-masters-deal-10610786/"> re-recording new versions of all her old songs</a> in order to own all of her masters.</p>
      <p>However, in a statement made on Twitter last week, Taylor implored her fans to help her after alleging that Scott, Scooter and co. were preventing her from performing these tracks in a recorded setting before November 2020.</p>
