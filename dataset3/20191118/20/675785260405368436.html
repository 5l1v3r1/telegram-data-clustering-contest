      <h1>Football Manager 2020 top 10 cheap wonderkids less than £1million on FM20</h1>
      <h2>As you would expect Football Manager 2020 is jam-packed with wonderkids, but most of them already command an impressive price tag. Here are some for all those bosses with a modest budget</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:34:51+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:34</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>Football Manager has returned for another season, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/football-manager-2020-wonderkids-fm20-20823577">and as we previously pointed out,</a> the most enjoyable aspect of the game is unearthing and developing wonderkids.</p>
      <p>Nothing beats scouting an upcoming youngster, taking a chance on him, and watching him transform into the next Lionel Messi under your stewardship.</p>
      <p>The problem is though, given inflation in the real-life game, which has been mirrored perfectly in the digital world of FM20, even unknown wonderkids can cost a bomb.</p>
      <p>This is fine if you're managing <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> or Paris Saint-Germain, where you can blow your rivals away with your budget.</p>
      <p>But what if you're a Football Manager purist with very high expectations but a relatively modest budget, eh? Then what? Well fortunately for you we've got your back. Here are a list of some 'more affordable' wonderkids.</p>
      <p><b>Note:</b> <i>The price listed is the market value of said player when you start the game. This will change and clubs may demand a higher fee to sell.</i></p>
