      <h1>SIU investigating after boy, 14, injured in police chase in Scarborough</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:17:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:17</time> by <a rel="author">Joshua Freeman, CP24.com</a></address>
      <p>The province’s police watchdog has opened an investigation after a 14-year-old boy was injured while being chased by police in Scarborough last week.</p>
      <p>It happened at around 8:30 p.m. on Friday, November 15.</p>
      <p>Two undercover Toronto Police officers saw the boy in the area of 400 McCowan Road, in the vicinity of Eglinton Avenue East and McCowan Road.</p>
      <p>When the officers identified themselves, the boy fled, the Special Investigations Unit said in a press release.</p>
      <p>The SIU did not say why police were watching the boy.</p>
      <p>When the officers caught up with him, the boy was arrested and taken to hospital, where he was diagnosed with a serious injury.</p>
      <p>The SIU is an arm’s length provincial agency called in to investigate whenever police are involved in an incident resulting in a death, serious injury or allegations of sexual assault.</p>
      <p>Two investigators have been assigned to the case. The SIU has designated one subject officer and six witness officers.</p>
      <p>Anyone with information is being asked to contact the SIU.</p>
