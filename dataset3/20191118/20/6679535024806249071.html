      <h1>North civic body proposes tax hikes</h1>
      <h2>Proposals need to be placed before deliberative wing for nod</h2>

      <p>Presenting the revised budget estimates for the North Delhi Municipal Corporation on Monday, Commissioner Varsha Joshi made a slew of proposals for different types of tax hikes. These will have to be placed before the deliberative wing of the civic body for final approval.</p>
      <p>Ms. Joshi proposed the 2% increase in each of the rates charged from residential properties in categories A to H. Rates of non-residential have also been increased to 20%.</p>
      <p>Apart from this, an education cess of 1% of the annual value of the property has been proposed. A hike in the unit area value as proposed under recommendations of the Municipal Valuation Committee have also been put forward. This would increase the base value upon which the property tax rate would be calculated, thus increasing the tax to be paid.</p>
      <p>From revisions in these rates, the civic body hopes to earn and additional revenue of up to ₹100 crore, it said.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the commissioner also proposed the introduction of a ‘Betterment Tax’ — 15% of the annual value of the property tax — levied for the improvement in value of a property brought about by provision of various civic services and a professional tax, also proposed by the South Delhi Municipal Commission earlier in its budget. Through these two sources, the corporation hopes to get up to ₹550 crore.</p>
      <p>Having not received external revenue in the form of various grants from the Delhi government this year, the North corporation revised its income estimates downward by about ₹25 lakh.</p>
      <p>However, the civic body will also not be meeting targets set under the heads of taxes, rents, internal revenue and miscellaneous sources, under which income estimates have also been significantly cut.</p>
      <p>Despite this, budget estimates for 2020-21 have pegged income sources under the same heads much higher than the current year’s estimates.</p>
