      <p>Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said there is no need for the odd-even scheme to be extended as pollution levels in the city have come down.</p>
      <p>“The sky is clear now, there is no need of it [scheme],” he said at a press conference.</p>
      <p>The government had decided to implement the scheme starting November 4 after the city’s air quality plunged into the ‘severe’ category. The scheme concluded on November 15 with Mr. Kejriwal saying it could be extended if required.</p>
