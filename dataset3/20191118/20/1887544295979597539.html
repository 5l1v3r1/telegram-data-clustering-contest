      <h1>Crown drops charges against ‘Extinction Rebellion’ protesters who occupied Bloor Viaduct</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:00</time> by <a rel="author">Chris Herhalt, CP24.com</a></address>
      <p>The Crown has withdrawn mischief charges laid against 18 people who occupied the Bloor Viaduct for half a day last month as part of global “Extinction Rebellion protests.</p>
      <p>Several dozen activists started blocking traffic at both Broadview Avenue on the east side and Castle Frank Road on the west side at around 8 a.m. on Oct. 7.</p>
      <p>All vehicle traffic was blocked and at about noon, officers began physically carrying away demonstrators and loading them into paddy wagons.</p>
      <p>Twenty adults were detained that day, and eighteen of them were later charged with mischief under $5,000.</p>
      <p>The demonstration was part of a worldwide movement aimed at bringing more attention to the climate crisis and its ensuing impact on biodiversity.</p>
      <p>The Crown dropped all mischief charges before a judge at College Park courts on Monday afternoon, as several people gathered outside to support the demonstrators.</p>
      <p>The Crown said in court that it was not in the best interest of the public to prosecute them.</p>
