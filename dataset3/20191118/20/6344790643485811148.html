      <h1>Make the Crafting in D&amp;D More Robust with GHESH'S GUIDE TO MAKING THINGS</h1>

      <p>One thing that I kind of wish was more prevalent in <b><i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i></b> was the crafting system. The way that it’s written, there’s not a very robust system in place. Well, <b>Anne Gregersen</b> wanted to fix that with <b><i>Ghesh’s Guide to Making Things</i></b>. This is an unofficial supplement that DMs and players can use to help flesh out the crafting system in <i>D&amp;D</i>. There are guidelines for crafting the weapons and armor in the Player’s Handbook and more including modifications for weapons! This looks like an incredible tool if you want more crafting in your game. Oh, and did I mention that the book includes a grenade launcher? Yeah, it does.</p>
      <blockquote>Ghesh’s Guide to Making Things is a crafting and modification system designed to complement the 5th Edition rulesystem. The kobold inventor, Ghesh Fizzlebang, is an enigmatic character of some renown, known for his rather explosive ways of improving the equipment of his fellow adventurers. Though his background may cause some raised eyebrows as to the validity of his craft, Ghesh has thoroughly tested all of his inventions for imperfections before releasing it to the world—as is evident by the burns he’s received and fingers he’s lost.</blockquote>
