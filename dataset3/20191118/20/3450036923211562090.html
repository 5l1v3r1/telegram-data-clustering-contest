      <p>James (Jim) Jeffrey Cook, a.k.a. “Cookie” of New Boston, Missouri unexpectedly passed away on Friday November 15, 2019.</p>
      <p>Jim was born on September 23, 1954 in Des Moines Iowa to Marvin “Pete” and Mary (Donahue) Cook and was part of a big family, one of eight children.</p>
      <p>Jim was raised in Iowa and as a young man moved with his family to a homestead in rural New Boston, Missouri. Jim graduated from Bucklin R-II High School, went back to Iowa to work for a while, then Oklahoma, but eventually returned to the Missouri family home on Ladue Road, where he lived the rest of his life. Jim always had a dog and as a reflection of his gentle nature, dearly loved all his pets. From a young age he loved to tinker and used his skills and talents to run his own business, The New Boston Garage. He was a hard-working man, incredibly resourceful and sentimental. He listened to public radio daily, loved music of all types and a day didn’t go by that didn’t have music in it. He was an avid reader of all genres including contemporary authors, classical literature (especially Russian authors) and periodicals of all types. He loved being in the timber: hunting and cutting wood. Jim also collected rocks and made a fire pit in the front yard where he often sat with friends. In the winter, there was always a trail of smoke coming from his chimney, keeping his home warm with dinner cooking on the old woodstove.</p>
      <p>The walls of Jim’s home and his collections spoke to who he was. Pictures of classic cars and trucks were hung all over the back porch. Jim kept two photo albums on a shelf within easy reach which were full of pictures he had collected showing what was most important to him: family, friends and a lot of music. The walls were adorned with reflections of Jim’s interest in the nations around him with maps of France, Africa, a World Map and of the galaxies above him. A map of the U.S.A. was wrapped around the water heater. Poster size images of music icons were also displayed throughout the living room and on the cabinet doors, both outside as well as on the inside, and showed some of his music heroes: Bob Dylan, The Beatles, Neil Young, etc. Multiple newspaper cuttings and flyers of his brother Pat’s band, the Electric Rag Band, were displayed throughout. Book shelves were full of his vinyl record collection. There were also pictures displayed of past New Boston Folk Festivals, family group photos from annual Memorial Day weekend reunions, pictures of Jim’s kids and several pictures of his mother whom he always referred to with utmost respect. A Chevy truck sitting in the yard bears a Neil Young title, “Rust Never Sleeps” hand-painted by Jim on the fender next to a rusty area (Jim always had a good sense of humor).</p>
      <p>Jim is survived by his children, Mandy (Cook) Morton and Husband Bailey of Brookfield, MO., Andrew Friesen and wife, Sharon of Minco, OK; Lica Cook of Moberly, MO., one sister, Thoma Lou Maddy and husband Frank of Bluff Dale Texas, five brothers: Stephen Cook of Chariton IA, Doug Cook of Phoenix, AZ., Gary Cook of St. Charles, IA., Pat Cook of Skiatook, OK., David Cook and wife Melinda of New Boston, MO.; brother-in-law, Mike Leinhauser of Bettendorf, IA. Jim is also survived by numerous grandchildren, nieces, nephews and great nieces and nephews, dear friend, Dale Langman, next door neighbor, Jerry Thompson, and many, many other friends too numerous to list.</p>
      <p>Jim was preceded in death by his parents and one sister, Sally Leinhauser.</p>
