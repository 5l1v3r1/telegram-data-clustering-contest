      <h1>State deals to drive down power prices </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:26:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:26</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.mygc.com.au/author/aap/" target="_blank">AAP</a></address>
      <p>The Morrison government has offered to do individual deals with each state in a bid to further drive down power prices and ensure electricity reliability.</p>
      <p>The deals will involve the Commonwealth partnering on joint projects and each state addressing issues unique to them as well as examining emission reductions.</p>
      <p>Energy Minister Angus Taylor has described the move as a “third path”, having already begun dealing with “foundational problems” at a COAG level as well as “jurisdictional responsibilities”.</p>
      <p>“I have begun early discussions on what they will look like,” the minister told the UBS Australasia conference in Sydney on Monday.</p>
      <p>“Each state is different and each deal will focus the particular challenges of that jurisdiction.”</p>
      <p>He gives the example of Tasmania focusing on two key projects – Battery of the Nation and Marinus Link.</p>
      <p>“I will only do deals with states that are collaborative and bring something to the table.”</p>
      <p>Australia’s energy ministers are scheduled to meet in Perth on Friday.</p>
      <p>Mr Taylor is most critical of Victoria’s Labor state government because drilling for gas is banned in the state for environmental reasons.</p>
      <p>He says 2019 was the year of “turning the tide on price” as well as being the year of “reliability”.</p>
      <p>“2020 will be the year that locks those two items into the energy sector for the next decade and established a market that will carry us through to 2030.</p>
      <p>“We must get this right – we must avoid grand schemes and giant leaps and we must work collaboratively on the price and reliability challenges that impact the everyday lives of all Australians.”</p>
      <p>In a veiled swipe at former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull’s national energy guarantee, or NEG, Mr Taylor says: “People wanted an acronym, they wanted a promise of salvation and they wanted it to be one policy.”</p>
      <p>However, as minister he had discovered reforming the energy system was “massively complex”.</p>
      <p>On prices, Mr Taylor said the cost of power had fallen for three consecutive quarters, according to official CPI figures, and recent data had shown price falls for gas.</p>
      <p>“The futures prices are promising with Q4 2021 prices well within our price target up to $20 MWh cheaper than Q4 2020.”</p>
      <p>But Labor frontbencher Penny Wong says wholesale power prices have risen under the government, while investors lack certainty.</p>
      <p>“It would be good if he came up with a plan, wouldn’t it,” she told reporters in Adelaide.</p>
      <p>“Because every day there’s just another idea, another thought bubble.”</p>
