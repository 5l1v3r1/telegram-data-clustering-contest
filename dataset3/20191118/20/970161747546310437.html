      <p>Jacqueline Jossa might be a long way from her family while she’s in the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/im-a-celebrity/">I’m A Celebrity</a> jungle but they’ve been quick to take to social media to show their support for her.</p>
      <p>The actress – best known as EastEnders’ Lauren Branning – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/im-a-celebritys-jacqueline-jossa-terrified-as-she-takes-on-plank-in-first-challenge-11168620/">was left terrified on Sunday night’s season opener</a> as she faced the show’s notorious ‘walk the plank’ challenge alongside teammate Ian Wright.</p>

      <p>Jacqueline and former Towie star Dan <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/04/22/dan-osborne-responds-after-hes-pictured-partying-with-female-friend-amid-jacqueline-jossa-split-rumours-9284301/">have had their ups and downs in recent years</a>, briefly splitting last year – but are they still together?</p>

      <h3>Are Jacqueline Jossa and Dan Osborne still married?</h3>
      <p>Despite all the rumours, Jacqueline and Dan are indeed still married.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/05/03/jacqueline-jossa-confirms-dan-osborne-still-together-said-losing-friendship-9396483/">The actress confirmed they are still together</a> while answering fan questions on Instagram back in May, sharing a video of Dan and answering the question of whether they were still married with a simple ‘yep’.</p>

      <p>Dan had sparked speculation earlier this year after suggesting <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/04/30/dan-osborne-reveals-two-year-marriage-jacqueline-jossa-brink-ending-losing-friendship-9369574/">he and Jacqueline were ‘losing their friendship’</a>, and addressed his marriage in an interview with new! magazine.</p>
      <p>When asked if they had talked about ending things he said: ‘No, but there is a real negative energy and life’s too short to live like that. I just want to be happy and I want Jac to be happy. Whether that’s with me or not.</p>

      <p>‘It’s more like a really bad tension in the house and it’s getting worse. We’re losing our friendship. When I feel it’s getting too much, I’ll get out of the house and go to the gym or something.’</p>
      <p>The couple – who have been together since 2013 – have been married for two years, and have <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/03/16/dan-osborne-looks-downcast-amid-alexandra-cane-cheat-claims-jacqueline-jossa-defiantly-flaunts-wedding-ring-8914902/">previously struggled with rumours of infidelity.</a></p>
      <p>Their relationship came under scrutiny earlier this year after they faced rumours that Dan had been unfaithful with Love Island’s Gabby Allen – whom he later appeared with on Celebrity Big Brother – <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/03/16/dan-osborne-looks-downcast-amid-alexandra-cane-cheat-claims-jacqueline-jossa-defiantly-flaunts-wedding-ring-8914902/">and also Alexandra Cane.</a></p>

      <p>He also hit back after he was pictured partying with a female friend in Los Angeles in April, saying on Instagram Stories: ‘So much bulls**t gets posted and printed about me. Seriously just want them to leave me alone now. It’s getting too much, I can’t even hang out with friends or even work without them talking s**t about me. Am I being targeted? Cause I swear I don’t see others getting it like I do.’</p>

      <p>Jacqueline and Dan did break up briefly in early 2018, reportedly due to ‘a series of rows’ but reunited after Dan’s spell in the Celebrity Big Brother house in August, when he admitted how much he had missed her.</p>
