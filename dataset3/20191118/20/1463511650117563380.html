      <p>Egbeyemi said that Dr Ogunmo Bamidele, who led the medical team from the University of Ibadan, had to tranquilised the lion thrice before evacuation.</p>
      <p>He said that the agency responded to a petition from residents on the use of the lion as maiguard.</p>
      <p>According to him, investigations revealed that the lion was brought in from Cameroun by an Indian national two years ago.</p>
      <p>“Immediately I got the petition, I deployed my officers to the house at No. 229, Muri-Okunola Street, Victoria Island, Lagos, where they kept a close watch for more than 72 hours before the lion was finally removed today,” he said.</p>
      <p>He assured residents that the owner of the lion would face the full wrath of the law, while warning residents to abstain from harbouring wild animals that endanger the lives of others.</p>
      <p>“In as much as we appreciate residents around Victoria Island for their quick action, we urge every member of the public to be observant in their immediate environment.</p>
      <p>“Residents should report any strange or unusual activity to appropriate government authority for prompt action,” Egbeyemi said.</p>
      <p>The Director, Veterinary Services, Lagos State Ministry of Agriculture, Dr Macaulay Rasheed, advised members of the public to stop rearing wild animals in private homes to avoid unnecessary attack and contagious animal diseases.</p>
