      <h1>Chelsea's Mason Mount can be an England superstar - if he ignores the background noise</h1>
      <h2>Chelsea youngster Mount scored his first Three Lions goal against Kosovo, is highly-rated by both Gareth Southgate and Frank Lampard, and can shine at Euro 2020</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:40:25+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:40</time> by <a rel="author">Stan Collymore, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/stan-collymore/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/mason-mount">Mason Mount</a> isn’t far from being an automatic starter for <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/england-football-team">England</a> now.</p>
      <p>And if he continues his ­current trajectory, as he said himself after scoring his first goal for his country, a big ­summer lies ahead.</p>
      <p>His <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> boss, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/frank-lampard">Frank Lampard,</a> clearly has huge faith in him, and Three Lions chief Gareth ­Southgate will have been ­impressed with everything he saw from the young man against ­Montenegro and, as a ­substitute, Kosovo.</p>
      <p>At 20, Mount is now at a pivotal point in his career and my hope is that he changes absolutely nothing about his game in the months and years ahead.</p>
      <p>When the spotlight shines on you at this age it is easy to listen to everything everybody says.</p>

      <p>And, ­undoubtedly, some voices in the media or ­on social media will be telling him, ‘James Maddison is a ­better passer of the ball than you, so you need to work on that’.</p>
      <p>Others will say, ‘So-and-so gets forward better than you’, or, ‘Such-and-such sits deeper and gets on the ball to link up play better than you’.</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, that sort of chat just confuses players, it hinders rather than helps their development because they end up wanting to be all things to all men.</p>

      <p>Wayne Rooney had a great career in becoming ­Manchester United and ­England’s record goalscorer.</p>
      <p>But there’s an argument that he could have scored even more goals if he’d been selfish and refused to move out wide to accommodate Cristiano Ronaldo, or if he hadn’t dropped back to play in midfield as early as he did.</p>
      <p>So the key message to Mount is not to get confused and to just keep improving.</p>
      <p>He needs to continue ­getting involved in play by running off a striker and ­joining the attack when crosses are put into the box.</p>
      <p>He is a phenomenal, classic box-to-box goal­scoring ­midfielder and we need to ­encourage him to perfect that role.</p>
      <p>In fact, the only ­adjustment now must come from his managers.</p>

      <p>I want to see them loosen the shackles even more so he can find more space to work in.</p>
      <p>There will be plenty of time in his late 20s and early 30s for Mount to adjust his game, as Steven Gerrard and David Beckham did.</p>
      <p>On Saturday evening, we will ­arguably get a better ­picture of where Mount is at when ­Chelsea travel to ­Manchester City. The same goes for the rest of Lampard’s youngsters.</p>
      <p>The Blues boss won’t use the phrase ‘bonus game’, but that is how he will see it against another of his former clubs.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>What he will say is, ‘Chaps, go and enjoy it, go and test yourself against these players.</p>
      <p>‘We’re doing well but the pressure is all on them, they have had a couple of ropey results, they’re a bit off the pace, so let’s go and see if we can test them.</p>
      <p>‘Try to win your individual battles and let’s see if we can walk away from the Etihad with three points. If we can, great. If we lose then we’ve been shown the benchmark’.</p>
      <p>Hopefully, Mount already knows the benchmarks he is working towards and for ­Chelsea and England it’s vital nothing, or no one, blows him off course.</p>
