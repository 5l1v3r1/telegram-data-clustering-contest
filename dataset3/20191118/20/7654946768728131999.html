      <h1>Markelle Fultz’s resurgence could be for real</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:35:47+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:35</time> by <a rel="author">Zach Braziller</a></address>
      <p>Markelle Fultz is taking baby steps. It beats going backwards.</p>
      <p>The No. 1 overall pick in the 2017 draft <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/24/this-is-the-markelle-fultz-moment-the-nba-has-been-clamoring-for/">continues to remake himself with the Magic</a> after his disappointing stint with the 76ers. On Sunday, he scored a career-high 19 points in a victory over the Wizards. He finished the game with a flourish, coming up with a steal and a breakaway dunk that included getting fouled. He made eight of 10 shots, including going 2-for-3 on 3-pointers.</p>
      <p>“I never lost confidence,” Fultz, whose NBA career has been hampered by shoulder problems, <a href="https://twitter.com/NBATV/status/1196241197439868929?s=20">told NBA TV</a> after the game.</p>
      <p>“I’m just feeling better. I took the time this summer to rehab and get everything right physically. Each game out there, I’m feeling more and more better. It’s showing in my play and I’m just going to keep going.”</p>
      <p>The former University of Washington star has found a new home in Orlando after his much-documented shooting and injury woes in Philadelphia. In two years there, he appeared in just 33 games. So far in 13 games with the Magic, he’s averaging 10.5 points on 48.6 shooting, along with 3.1 assists and 2.2 rebounds. He’s making progress, which certainly is better than anything he could say about his first two seasons in the NBA.</p>
