      <h4>Straight from the dark side: The debut of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker is only a month away. In celebration of its release, Samsung has announced it is offering a Sith special edition Star Wars Galaxy Note 10 Plus.</h4>
      <p>The black Note 10 comes with a themed case featuring the First Order badge and Star Wars logo on the back and red trim around the camera lens array. To complete the look, it comes bundled with a lightsaber-red S Pen and black Galaxy Buds. The charging case for the earphones is themed red and black, as well.</p>
      <p>The device will also come with exclusive digital content, including Star Wars wallpapers, shutdown animations, icons, and sounds. Samsung even threw in a metal Kylo Ren badge as a collector's item perk.</p>

      <p>Everything comes <a href="https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/campaigns/star-wars-ix-collaboration/">packaged</a> in a similarly styled collector's box featuring an image of Ren and the phrase, "I'll show you the dark side."</p>
      <p>Unfortunately, not all Star Wars fans will have access to the exclusive bundle. It is only being released in "select markets" — specifically, the US, UK, Australia, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Norway, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Korea, Russia, Spain, Turkey, and the UAE.</p>
      <aside>"Samsung has joined forces with Star Wars to engage its passionate users with its best devices and the Galaxy brand in a new and exciting way."</aside>
      <p>The Star Wars / Galaxy Note 10 bundle goes on sale starting December 10 for $1,300. If you are crunching the numbers, that's a $460 markup over the no-frills model.</p>
      <p>Samsung <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-announces-galaxy-note10plus-star-wars-special-edition">mentions</a> in its press release that this is the first of several "interactions" between the brand and Lucasfilm. So, we could be seeing another hero-themed edition sometime down the road.</p>
      <p>"[This] is one of several interactions that Samsung and Lucasfilm have planned to bring a joyous colliding of two Galaxies," said Samsung.</p>
