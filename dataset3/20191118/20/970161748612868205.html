      <p>Roman Kemp is indeed in a relationship, with Swiss-born girlfriend Anne-Sophie Flury.</p>
      <p>The pair have been together for two years – and although Anne-Sophie spent eight months of their relationship living in Hong Kong she has admitted this will be the longest time that they’ve ever gone without contact.</p>

      <p>Speaking to the Mirror she explained: ‘He’s left a two-minute video for every day that he can’t speak to me. I’ll get to watch one of them every morning.</p>
      <p>Anne-Sophie – who recently launched Shu Gum, a product which can be used to eliminate odours and clean shoes – added: ‘I’m so excited but I miss him so much! It’s really difficult  not being able to speak to him.</p>
      <p>‘It’ll be easier when the show starts so I can watch what he’s up to.’</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Roman told OK, ahead of his trip to the jungle: ‘She’ll probably love a break away from me. But she’s so supportive. She lived in Hong Kong for eight months during our relationship so we’re used to long distance.</p>
