      <p>Nov. 18 (UPI) -- Mike "The Situation" Sorrentino and his wife, Lauren Sorrentino, are going public about Lauren's miscarriage.</p>
      <p>The couple discussed the "heart-wrenching" experience during a joint <a href="https://twitter.com/StrahanSaraKeke/status/1196474670146568193">interview</a> Monday on <i>Strahan, Sara &amp; Keke</i> on <i>Good Morning America</i>.</p>
      <p>Lauren Sorrentino said she conceived the night Sorrentino <a href="https://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/2019/09/12/Jersey-Shore-star-Mike-Sorrentino-released-from-prison/1891568298550/">returned home from prison</a> in September but had a miscarriage a few weeks later.</p>
      <p>"The night he came home, we actually conceived. And then about six and a half, seven weeks, I miscarried," Lauren Sorrentino said.</p>
      <p>"It was heart-wrenching. When we found out we were pregnant, I felt like this is why we went through all these challenges for years, and that it was our time and our blessing," she added.</p>
      <p>Lauren Sorrentino decided to share her story to support others who have experienced miscarriages and to start healing.</p>
      <p>"It was hard. It was really difficult," Lauren Sorrentino said. "We share so much of our life and we've already shared so many negative things that we've gone through, that I didn't want to hold this in. I wanted to share it for other people going through it and just be honest, so I can kind of heal through the process."</p>
      <p>Sorrentino shared a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5At8WblZvC/">photo</a> with Lauren Sorrentino from the <i>Good Morning America</i> set Monday on Instagram. His <i>Jersey Shore</i> co-star Nicole "Snooki" Polizzi was among those to voice their love and support for the couple in the comments.</p>
      <p>"love you both," Polizzi wrote, adding two heart emojis.</p>
