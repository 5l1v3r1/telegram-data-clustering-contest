      <p>A three-member panel appointed by the Centre to restore normal functioning of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) will initiate dialogue with students once it has gathered data on the hostel fee hike, which is the cause of the ongoing agitation.</p>
      <p>“Our primary target is the students, because we want to hear directly from them what their issues are. But we need to gather data first,” panel member V.S. Chauhan told <i>The Hindu</i> on Monday when asked how the panel proposed to carry out its task.</p>
      <p>“The panel was only formed today... We must do it very fast. It cannot be a matter of weeks. The dialogues must happen very fast,” he added.</p>
      <p>Dr. Chauhan was speaking on a day when hundreds of JNU students clashed with police, facing arrests and lathi-charges, as they attempted to march to Parliament to air their woes.</p>
      <p>The panel was set up by the Human Resource Development Ministry to act as a mediator between the students and the university administration.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, the Ministry appointed Dr. Chauhan, who is a former chairperson of the University Grants Commission, along with current UGC secretary Rajnish Jain and All India Council for Technical Education Anil Sahasrabudhe to the panel, with UGC providing any support needed.</p>
      <p>The panel has been asked to initiate “dialogue with all the stakeholders and to advise the university administration for resolution of contentious issues”. It will submit recommendations on the action to be taken to restore normal functioning.</p>
      <p>“Our mandate is only to resolve this particular issue,” said Dr. Chauhan. “It’s not to make an enquiry. We will simply initiate dialogue with all stakeholders.”</p>
      <p>Dr. Jain said the stakeholders include JNU Students’ Union office-bearers, hostel presidents, faculty members and university administration authorities as well as HRD Ministry officials.</p>
