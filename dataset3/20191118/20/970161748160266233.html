        <b>Ben Mitchell (Max Bowden) has been making Martin Fowler’s (James Bye) <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/15/eastenders-spoilers-a-dark-new-storyline-is-revealed-for-ben-mitchell-as-he-takes-revenge-10916938/">life a living hell</a> in EastEnders over the last couple of months. From threatening the fruit-and-veg stall holder’s family, to <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/25/eastenders-spoilers-shocking-scenes-as-ben-mitchell-goes-to-extreme-lengths-to-get-revenge-on-martin-fowler-after-his-betrayal-10981669/">dangling him off the edge of the railway bridge</a>, it’s safe to say Ben has stopped at nothing to assert his authority, but tonight mum Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth) discovered the truth — and an altercation ensued as a result.</b>
      </p>
      <p>With news of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/14/eastenders-spoilers-shocking-scenes-mel-owen-dies-surviving-car-explosion-11127193/">Mel’s (Tamzin Outhwaite) death</a> spreading around Walford like wildfire, Ian (Adam Woodyatt) was particularly emotional. Long-time viewers will remember that both he and Mel had a relationship back in the early ‘00s, and — although their marriage remains one of the shortest in the soap’s history — Ian was incredibly fond of her.</p>
      <p>As a result, he resolved to throw a family meal to remember Mel, and thus Ben invited boyfriend Callum (Tony Clay) to the event. However, Ben was far from pleased to see Martin among those at the table.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>Throughout the meal, the animosity was rife, as Ben and Martin took several jibes at one another, and when Martin discovered that Callum was interested in joining the police, he proceeded to wind Ben up.</p>

      <p>Callum was confused by the pair’s altercation, and when he confronted his boyfriend on the matter, he came to realise how much Ben was struggling with the prospect of him becoming a copper. Ben specified how he didn’t think it possible for them to remain a couple if he were to pursue his dream job and thus Callum stormed out as a result.</p>
      <p>Afterwards, a conflicted Ben proceeded to get drunk, and before long, he roped Martin back into his games. However, in doing so, he threatened Stacey’s (Lacey Turner) family — not to mention little Arthur — and Kathy overheard the whole thing.</p>
      <p>With Kathy having formerly been married to Pete Beale (Peter Dean) — who was Martin’s mum Pauline Fowler’s (Wendy Richard) twin brother — Martin is technically her family and — by association —Ben’s too, which is why she was so horrified by what she heard.</p>
      <p>Later, she confronted an incredibly drunk Ben over his actions, but Ben was quick to turn the tables, and reminded her of how she disappeared from her children’s lives — claiming that such an action is hardly admirable either.</p>

      <p>However, Kathy used Ben’s ammunition against him, informing him that she was persuaded to do something by a sinister man — Gavin Sullivan (Paul Nicholas) — which is exactly what he’s doing to Martin.</p>

      <p>Getting fed up, Ben turned vicious and claimed that Kathy deserved all the heartache she’s experienced in life because she’s weak, before telling her that weak people love to be abused.</p>
      <p>Horrified by what her son said to her, Kathy gave him a thunderous slap, before informing him that she’s ashamed of him.</p>
      <p>Ben’s superior-than-all façade seemingly faltered after what his mum said — clearly taken aback by what she did — but will Kathy’s words be enough to convince him to change his ways?</p>
      <p>If he doesn’t, he’s going to lose all those around him — Callum included, something which was more apparent in this episode more so than ever before.</p>
      <p>Is it possible for Ben to change?</p>
