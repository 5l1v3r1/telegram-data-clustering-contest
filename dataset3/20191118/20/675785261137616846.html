      <h1>Damning stats show 20% of football fans are 'comfortable' with homophobia in game</h1>
      <h2>An eye-opening YouGov survey found that just 37 per cent of the football fans think the game is becoming a safer space for players to come out</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:08:17+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:08</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Polden, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/jake-polden/</a></address>
      <p>A staggering 20 per cent of football fans are 'comfortable' with homophobia in the game, according to research carried out by Paddy Power and Gay Times.</p>
      <p>A YouGov survey spoke with 1,010 heterosexual football fans across the country and found that 30 per cent still admit they find two men kissing at a match uncomfortable.</p>
      <p>Much has been done to stamp out homophobia in football in recent years, with the Rainbow Laces - and captain's armbands - campaign recognised throughout the game.</p>
      <p>But, to date, there are no players who feel comfortable coming out at the top levels of the professional men's game in England.</p>
      <p>What's more, only 37 per cent of the football fans who took part in the survey think the game is becoming a safer space for players to come out, suggesting more needs to be done.</p>

      <p>Tag Warner, CEO at GAY TIMES, said: "Recent years have seen real and meaningful progress in tackling discrimination towards the LGBTQ+ community among football fans â€“ but our research shows there remains significant work to be done.</p>
      <p>"So while football fans make the right noises by saying homophobic abuse has no place in the modern game and stress that they would like to see more out LGBTQ+ figures, it's depressing to see that a third would find two men kissing a problem while the same proportion believe homophobia is not an issue.</p>

      <p>"With Paddy Power we're committed to rooting out and kicking out homophobia wherever it's located.</p>
      <p>"These problematic attitudes tarnish a sport that brings so much happiness to millions across the country."</p>
