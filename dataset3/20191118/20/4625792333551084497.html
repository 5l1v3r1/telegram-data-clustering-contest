      <p>Rep. Matt Gaetz celebrated the news on Monday that the woman who threw a sports drink at him had been sentenced to 15 days in prison for the attack.</p>
      <p>"Physical assault has no place in our political discourse," Gaetz said. "I am grateful that law enforcement and our judicial system recognized this principle today."</p>

      <p>During a campaign event in June, Amanda Kondrat'yev threw a red drink at the congressman from the Florida panhandle. She was there along with other protesters who <a href="https://www.rollcall.com/news/woman-faces-up-to-one-year-of-in-prison-for-milkshaking-rep-matt-gaetz">shouted at him</a> and held signs telling him to "wipe the blood off his hands" and shamed him for his "A+" rating from the NRA.</p>
      <p>“Constituents deserve to be safe at events hosted by our congressional office. My staff deserves to be safe," Gaetz said in a victim impact statement submitted in court. "Their families and mine shouldn’t have to worry that while federal officials are doing their jobs, we are at risk of assault.”</p>
      <p>Kondrat'yev, a 35-year-old wife and mother of two, briefly ran against Gaetz as a Democratic challenger in the 2016 election, <a href="https://www.pnj.com/story/news/2019/11/18/woman-who-threw-slushie-matt-gaetz-sentenced-15-days-prison-amanda-kondratyev/4227935002/">according to the <i>Pensacola Journal</i>.</a> She faced up to a year in prison as a result of her conviction.</p>
      <p>The federal judge who heard the case said that a lack of prison time and the attack was "limited in duration" led him to the 15 days sentence decision.</p>
      <p>"I remain committed to maintaining a safe environment for my constituents at future events," Gaetz said.</p>
