      <p>PCSO Animal Control said the boy's grandmother told them her grandson was bitten on his hand after trying to help the raccoon because he looked sick.</p>
      <p>Two days after being sent to the state laboratory in Tampa, the raccoon was confirmed positive for rabies.</p>
      <p>“It is imperative that children are told to avoid animals like bats, raccoons, and foxes out in the wild, and let me be clear — these animals are wildlife. If you see one in distress, leave it alone and contact Polk County Animal Control immediately,” Sheriff Grady Judd said in a release.</p>
      <p>The 10 rabies cases confirmed in Polk County have consisted of five bats and five raccoons.</p>
      <p>In 2018, there were only three cases of rabies confirmed in Polk County.</p>
