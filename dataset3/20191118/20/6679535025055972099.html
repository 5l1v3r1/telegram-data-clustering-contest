      <h1>‘Chalo Parliament’: Girijan Sangham leaders leave for New Delhi</h1>
      <h2>Adivasis from 16 States to take part in protest on Thursday</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:04:28+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:04</time> by <a rel="author">Special Correspondent</a></address>
      <p>Representatives of Girijan Sangham on Monday left for Delhi where they will take part in the ‘Chalo Parliament’ programme, scheduled to be organised on November 21 (Thursday), to press for the protection of the rights of tribal people on forest land.</p>
      <p>Addressing the gathering, Girijan Sangham State general secretary P. Appalanarsa said thousands of Adivasis from 16 States in the country would participate in the programme to register their protest against the petition filed by retired forest officers pertaining to the Forest Rights Act.</p>
      <h3>SC hearing on Nov. 26</h3>
      <p>The petition would come up for hearing in Supreme Court on November 26.</p>
      <p>“A grave injustice was meted out to the tribal people as the NDA government did not appoint a lawyer or depute an official during the last hearing. This had resulted in the court ruling that tribal people who had no pattas should be evicted from forests. The ruling was temporarily stayed following the protests by the Girijans,” Mr. Appalanarsa pointed out.</p>
      <p>He also alleged that several eligible tribal people were not issued pattas by the State government till date.</p>
      <h3>‘76,000 pleas rejected’</h3>
      <p>The applications submitted by around 76,000 tribal people were rejected at the division stage itself. “The Centre must introduce the Adivasi Forest Rights Protection Bill in the winter session of Parliament,” Mr. Appalanarsa said and called upon tribal leaders to oppose the decision of the Centre to amend the Forest Rights Act, 1927. Girijan Sangham leaders M.M. Srinu, Prithviraj and Matsyaraju were present.</p>
