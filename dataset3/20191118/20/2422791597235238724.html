      <p>OTTAWA - Even before he swears in his new cabinet, Justin Trudeau is being urged to ask his new justice minister to move swiftly to make Canada's assisted-dying law less restrictive.</p>
      <p>The prime minister has said he'll comply with a September court ruling that struck down as unconstitutional the requirement that only those near death can qualify for medical help to end their suffering.</p>
      <p>In her ruling, Quebec Superior Court Judge Christine Baudouin gave the government six months -- until early April 2020 -- to amend the law.</p>
      <p>Dying with Dignity Canada is urging Trudeau to have his next justice minister give priority to amending the law and go further than the ruling demands.</p>
      <p>The group wants the government to get rid of the requirement that a person's natural death must be reasonably foreseeable in order to qualify for a doctor-assisted death.</p>
      <p>It also wants the government to drop the requirement that someone must be able to give consent for an assisted death immediately prior to receiving the procedure -- a provision that has stripped the right from some people who lose the capacity to consent as their condition deteriorates.</p>
