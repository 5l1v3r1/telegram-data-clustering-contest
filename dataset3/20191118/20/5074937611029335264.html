      <p>Accra, Nov 18, GNA - The National Road Safety Authority (NRSA) has launched its 2019 road safety campaign to raise the level of awareness for the Christmas season.</p>
      <p>The Campaign started in Accra under the theme, "Stop Road Accidents Now, Before it Stops You."</p>
      <p>A press statement copied to the Ghana News Agency and signed by Mrs. May Obiri-Yeboah, the Director-General of the Authority, stated that the yuletide season was usually considered as the topmost risk season for road safety due to increases in motorization and travels before and during the period, as well as the excitement and merry making, which was often characterized by total disrespect for road traffic rules and regulations.</p>
      <p>She said the season was also noted for high travel speeds, overtaking, fatigue driving, driving under the influence of alcohol, drugs and wrongful road crossings.</p>
      <p>"Though provisional statistics from January to September this year (2019) indicate a 6.07% and 2.25% increase in the number of crashes and injuries respectively, the period has recorded a reduction of 7.6% in persons killed through road traffic crashes over the same period of 2018 and a further reduction in pedestrian knock downs by 17.4% during the same period," She stated.</p>
      <p>Engineer Obiri-Yeboah noted that it was the expectation of the NRSA that all road users practiced safe road use in traffic.</p>
      <p>"Drivers to be responsible, Pedestrians to cross the road at designated safe crossing points, Passengers to wear Seatbelts and Speak up against all forms of driver misbehavior that endangers their lives before, during and after the festive season, and motorcyclist and tricyclists to wear their helmets and avoid unsafe operational practices, while transport organisations and institutions observe internal controls systems, which make crashes unattractive," She advised.</p>
      <p>She said a crash-free Christmas was possible, provided road users will renew their pledge to be more disciplined.</p>
      <p>She expressed the Authority's best wishes to all road users and commiserated with all families who had lost parents, breadwinners and relatives to road traffic crashes as well as those who remained injured through road traffic crashes in the year 2019.</p>
      <p>She commended the Ministry of Transport (MoT), DVLA, MTTD, Ghana Road Transport Coordinating Council (GRTCC), Ghana Private Road Transport Union (GPRTU), and all stakeholders for their partnership throughout the year to ensuring road safety in the country.</p>
      <p>"The Board, Management and Staff of the National Road Safety Authority wish you all an accident free Christmas and a Prosperous New Year," The statement said.</p>
