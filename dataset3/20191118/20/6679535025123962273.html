      <p>The Delhi Cabinet on Monday passed a scheme to provide free sewer connections to residents in areas where sewer lines have been laid.</p>
      <p>The residents have till March 31 next year to apply for the service, said Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal.</p>
      <p>Development, road-cutting and connection charges will be waived under the ‘Mukhyamantri Muft Sewer Yojana’. The move is expected to benefit around 2.34 lakh households, said the Delhi government. The decision comes months ahead of the Assembly elections, which are due in February 2020.</p>
      <p>“The Delhi government has invested thousands of crores of rupees and laid thousands of kilometres of sewer lines across the city. Despite this, lakhs of households have not taken sewer connections due to high installation and development charges,” said Mr. Kejriwal.</p>
      <p>The CM added that the Delhi government had earlier decreased the development charges for sewer connections from ₹500 per square metre to ₹100 per square metre, “but the individual charges to instal a sewer connection still burned a hole in the pocket of the people”.</p>
      <p>“At a meeting on Monday, the Delhi Cabinet decided to provide relief to those people who have not taken the sewer connections despite having a sewage line in their area,” he said. The Delhi government will bear all costs for the infrastructure, installation, and development charges of household sewer connections under the scheme.</p>
      <p>“As per the Delhi Jal Board’s data, around 2.34 lakh households in Delhi have not installed a sewer connection in areas where we have laid sewer lines. We hope that more households can take connections and take advantage of the scheme. This will also prevent waste from being dumped into stormwater drains and the Yamuna,” said Mr. Kejriwal.</p>
      <p>He added that the Delhi government would be publicising the scheme so that people are aware of the scheme.</p>
