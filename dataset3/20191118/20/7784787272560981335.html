      <h3>Former NRL great Braith Anasta has backed Latrell Mitchell to join the Wests Tigers but warned the 22-year-old is not ready to play fullback.</h3>
      <p>The Tigers appear to be the frontrunners to land Mitchell, with coach Michael Maguire and CEO Justin Pascoe recently visiting him in Taree.</p>
      <p>The North Queensland Cowboys are also in the race <a href="https://www.foxsports.com.au/nrl/nrl-premiership/teams/cowboys/nrl-2020-latrell-mitchell-contract-cowboys-tour-roosters-rumours-wests-tigers-trent-robinson/news-story/5e9d14d4b2929bf4472403f8c2a73132">having met with Mitchelll in Townsville on Monday.</a></p>

      <p>Anasta, however, said he believed the Roosters star would stay in Sydney.</p>
      <p>“I’ve got a little bit of inside mail, I think that’s where he’s going to end up,” he told Fox Sports News.</p>
      <p>“It’s a great buy, it’s a loss for the Roosters but it’s a great buy for any club that he does go to.</p>

      <p>“I think the Wests Tigers have been crying out for a player of the calibre of Latrell Mitchell for so many years now. This guy is a game-changer.</p>
      <p>“Yes, they need to get the best out of him, and yes they don’t want to pay overs for him as well because he is asking for big dollars, but he can really transform that side into making some semi-finals, [and] take some pressure off Benji Marshall and Luke Brooks in the halves.”</p>
      <p>Anasta, who played , however warned against rushing Mitchell into the No.1 jersey.</p>
      <p>“If you’re asking me what position he is best at it’s in the centres. Fullback is so demanding these days. You’ve got to look at the likes of James Tedesco and how many metres they cover,” Anasta said.</p>

      <p>“You’ve got to be the fittest player on the field, you’ve got to be on the ball, on the move, 24/7 while you’re in that position. I don’t think Latrell is ready for that.</p>
      <p>“I think he’s just got to ice that centre position and play the full 80 minutes at the highest level, that’s what he’s got to do.”</p>
      <p>Anasta, who played 31 matches for the Tigers, said Mitchell’s tendency to drift in and out of games meant clubs should hold off paying him overs.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think he is [worth $1 million a season] at the moment,” Anasta said.</p>
      <p>“I wouldn’t begrudge anyone for paying that because he will get there sooner rather than later.</p>
      <p>“We saw the last pass for the grand final victory for the Roosters. If it wasn’t for him they probably don’t win. He’s got those big games in him but he doesn’t play for the 80 minutes every week.</p>
      <p>“For me a million-dollar player needs to be the highest of quality, consistently playing high quality for 80 minutes every week. He’s not quite there, [but] he will get there.”</p>
