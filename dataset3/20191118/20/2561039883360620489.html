      <p>iFixit has posted its full teardown of the new <a href="https://amzn.to/2r6fARO">16-inch MacBook Pro</a>.<br/><br/><i>It’s the all-new, butterfly-less, 16-inch MacBook Pro, and we’re here to turn it inside-out—from the fancy new thermals to those thumping loud speakers. </i><br/><br/><b>Highlights:</b><br/>● New model number: A2141<br/>● Scissor keyboard mechanism that looks nearly identical to the desktop Magic Keyboard but is 0.22mm thinner. More in the <a href="https://www.iclarified.com/73309/ifixit-tears-down-the-new-16inch-macbook-pro-keyboard">keyboard teardown</a>.<br/>● Keyboard backlight assembly consists of a flexible diffuser, which carries light from LEDs along the edges<br/>● Once again, the keyboard assembly is riveted down.<br/>● 16x Micron MT40A1G8SA-075 8 Gb DDR4 SDRAM (16 GB total)<br/>● Heat sink is 35 percent bigger.<br/>● Fancy new speakers with an extended enclosure, and opposed woofers on the top and bottom.<br/>● 99.8 Wh battery (11.36 V, 8790 mAh)<br/><br/><b>Reliability Score:</b> 1 out of 10<br/>● The trackpad can still be removed and replaced with very little drama.<br/>● Minor components are modular, but the processor, RAM, and flash memory are soldered to the logic board.<br/>● Glue and/or rivets secure the keyboard, battery, speakers, and Touch Bar, making those components a tricky fix.<br/>● The Touch ID sensor is the power switch and is locked to the logic board, greatly complicating repairs.<br/><br/>Check out a few images below and hit the link for the full teardown.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/MacBook+Pro+16-Inch+2019+Teardown/128106">Read More</a></p>
