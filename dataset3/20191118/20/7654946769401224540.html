      <p>Lucy Rose Jaine, 29, says she is against intensive factory-farmed food and hunts animals like wild pigs, deer, boars and wallabies to ensure what they eat is “organic and sustainable.”</p>
      <p>“I hate factory farming so hunting wild meat is ideal,” she says. “It’s free, it’s fun and it helps the farmers.”</p>
      <p>She frequently <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hunting_lucyjaine/?utm_source=ig_embed">posts scantily-clad Instagram photos</a> holding dead wild animals to show off her lifestyle, but many online critics call her carcass-carrying trophy pictures “sick,” “horrible” and “psychotic.”</p>
      <p>“Sad excuse for a human,” one commenter writes. “Hope someday she will be the one being killed and that would be a good kill,” writes another.</p>
      <p>Jaine <a href="https://mediadrumworld.com/2019/11/15/death-threat-hunter-mom/">tells Media Drum</a> she doesn’t take negative comments “to heart,” even people who threaten her life.</p>
      <p>“I’ve had a few death threats from people who just don’t have any experience with hunting,” she says. “Or maybe they are against animal cruelty.”</p>
      <p>Jaine claims she ensures to “respect the animal in the process,” noting that many local farmers encourage her to hunt to help with their “pig problem.”</p>

      <p>“The animals are living a good life,” she adds.</p>
      <p>While she has plenty of supporters on Instagram, some questioned her ethics. “So it’s ok to kill any animal that you decide has had a ‘fulfilled’ life?” one commenter writes. “I didn’t realize you were an omnipotent being that had the right to decide whether another animal lived or died?”</p>
      <p>The Wanaka resident says she and her partner, Sharn, often take their three children along hunting about five to eight times a month for food, family bonding time and because the wilderness “really sparks their imaginations.”</p>
      <p>“I like that we can teach our children how to hunt their own food,” she says of her brood, which range in age from five months to 7 years old. “The kids love the adventure.”</p>
      <p>Jaine says they gut, skin and clean the animals before cutting them up and freezing the parts, adding that she saves about $192 a month (300NZD) by hunting animals for meat.</p>
