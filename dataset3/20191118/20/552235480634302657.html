      <p>A drug dealer who supplied ecstasy that killed a 16-year-old and whose girlfriend took her life after he injured her is <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/courts">facing a lengthy jail sentence</a> .</p>
      <p>Lewis Reid, 22, known as Gucci, of Bridge of Weir, Renfrewshire, sold the Class A substance to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/glasgow-schoolgirl-dies-after-party-17676525">friends of Chelsea Bruce</a> , who took ill and died after taking some.</p>
      <p>Reid earlier left <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/beautiful-soul-teen-dancer-found-14152962">partner Codey Brown</a> , 18, seriously hurt after accelerating away while she was leaning into his car. The popular dance student was found dead months later.</p>
      <p>He crashed into police cars and drove at an officer who jumped clear before speeding at up to 120mph, weaving in and out of traffic, prior to his arrest.</p>
      <p>Ruaraidh Ferguson, prosecuting, said four teenagers, including Chelsea, clubbed together to buy ecstasy from a dealer, known as Gucci, in July.</p>

      <p>They met Reid near <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glasgow">Glasgow Central Station</a> , who sold two of the boys crystallised MDMA, then went to a house in Springburn, where three of the youngsters, including Chelsea, took alcohol and had two hits of the ecstasy.</p>
      <p>Mr Ferguson said Chelsea "began to shake and sweat so much her hair was wet".</p>
      <p>She was taken outside for a walk to cool her down but turned pale and was "gasping for breath".</p>
      <p>She had a fit and fell unconscious before being taken by ambulance to <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/glasgow">Glasgow Royal Infirmary</a> , where she died.</p>
      <p>Chelsea's family posted emotional tributes to her on social media.</p>
      <p>Her sister Brooke wrote: "My love for you will never die." A cousin wrote: "You put a smile on everyone's faces because you were such a kind, loving and beautiful person."</p>
      <p>Police visited two of the boys, aged 16 and 18, who had also been taken to hospital and one of them identified Reid as "Gucci", who had sold them the ecstasy.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, Reid put out a Snapchat message warning: "If anyone is saying I sold Chelsea Bruce anything just text or Snapchat me."</p>
      <p>Reid, who was not charged with supplying ecstasy to Chelsea, went to police and boasted: "I've dealt five kilos of this stuff and not one person's died yet." He was later arrested in a stolen Audi A3 and gave a no comment interview.</p>
      <p>Kilmarnock Sheriff Court was shown footage of Reid taking a teenage girlfriend to a cafe in Prestwick then fleeing with her after spotting police.</p>
      <p>One officer is seen trying to smash the windscreen of a stolen Skoda in which Reid sped off, forcing the policeman to jump clear.</p>
      <p>The court also heard Reid was in a relationship with Codey Brown, 18, and was arguing with her outside her home in Kilmarnock after they were supposed to go to Nandos but he found out she was with her mother.</p>
      <p>He drove off while Codey was still leaning through a window, catapulting her into the air and causing her to break her wrist.</p>
      <p>Seven months later Codey, described as "gorgeous" and a "best friend sibling", took her life." Reid pled guilty to dangerous driving rather than assault.</p>
      <p>Tributes poured in on social media after the tragedy and balloons were released in memory of the former pupil of the town's James Hamilton Academy.</p>
      <p>Her sister Teigan Brown posted on Twitter: "Never in a million years I thought I'd be writing this.</p>

      <p>"But sadly my best friend and sister all in one had gained her angel wings, you really were one of a kind Codey and I don't think you ever realised that and I just wish you were here to see all the people that love and care for you."</p>
      <p>Reid admitted 22 offences after the Crown accepted not guilty pleas to a further 26 charges.</p>
      <p>He admitted handling stolen vehicles, known as reset, reversing into police cars and speeding to escape officers.</p>
      <p>He careered across a roundabout, undertook other traffic, ran a red light and sped at 40mph through a built-up area - all in breach of bail or curfew orders.</p>
      <p>Reid also pled guilty to stealing fuel, fraudulent use of false number plates, driving uninsured, possessing cocaine, ecstasy and ketamine, and failing to appear at court.</p>
      <p>The offences were committed in Ayrshire, Renfrewshire and Glasgow between August 2018 and July.</p>
      <p>Reid has prior convictions for drug dealing and a "revenge porn" offence against a 16-year-old ex-girlfriend.</p>
      <p>Sheriff Elizabeth McFarlane told Reid: "I have to warn you I am seriously considering sending you to the high court for a sentence. I'm not sure my powers are enough, so prepare yourself for that."</p>
      <p>Sentence was deferred and Reid, a prisoner at Barlinnie, was remanded in custody.</p>
