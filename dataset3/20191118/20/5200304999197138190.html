      <p>Jackky Bhagnani’s Jjust Music, has always gone beyond what is considered conventional in music. Even though, he launched Jjust Music only a few months ago, Jackky is already working with international talent. After collaborating with global dancing sensation Dytto for his last song Choodiyan, Jackky has now announced his next move for his music label. The actor-producer has acquired rights to create the Indian adaptation of one of Arabic’s biggest chartbusters, titled “Mi Gna”. Sung by Super Sako, the Armenian American DJ who has charmed audiences the world over with his voice and music, Mi Gna is bound to bowl Indian tastes as well.</p>

      <p>Jackky Bhagnani says, “Super Sako’s voice and talent is inimitable and Mi Gna is a song that had me hooked from the moment I heard it. Meeting him in LA was the universe conspiring to making this collaboration happen. I’m very excited to be working with him and this is a great step forward for Jjust Music as well.”</p>
      <p>Super Sako says, “I’m looking forward to collaborate with Jjust Music to create the Indian version of Mi Gna. When I met Jackky in Los Angeles, his vision for music and his openness to creating new experiences inspired me and I knew at that instant that he would be the best person to create the Indian adaptation of my song.”</p>
      <p>Mi Gna is an all-time Arabic hit that has clocked over 185 million views on YouTube. Jjust Music has established itself as one of the most bankable music labels with popular songs like Prada with Alia Bhatt and Takda Rawan with Vishal Mishra, which received much acclaim. Their recent Navratri release Choodiyan had Dytto perform alongside Jackky, and had dancers swinging away. Jackky is sure of musical success with Mi Gna.</p>
