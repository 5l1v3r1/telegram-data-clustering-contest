      <h3>It looks like Behringer is bringing back the Wasp synth</h3>
      <p>
        <b>It looks like the launch of </b>
        <a href="https://www.musicradar.com/news/behringer-announces-wing-a-futuristic-digital-mixing-console">
          <u>
            <b>Behringer’s Wing digital mixer</b>
          </u>
        </a>
        <b> might come with a sting in the tail. If the rumours are true - and there’s certainly plenty of buzz around them - it’s working on a clone of the classic EDP Wasp synth.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Just a day after the Wing’s announcement, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BEHRINGER/photos/a.10150572353698914/10157854868048914/?type=3&amp;theater"><u>Behringer took to Facebook</u></a> again to borrow (clone?) the late Steve Jobs’ famous “Oh, and one more thing…” phrase, featuring it on image that also contains a small picture of - unless we’re very much mistaken - a wasp.</p>
      <p>There’s another clue, too: the caption accompanying the image features the words “Uli BEEringer”, another none-too-subtle allusion to a hymenopterous insect.</p>
      <p>The original Wasp was a British synth that was launched in 1978, and featured a striking black and yellow colour scheme. It was a dual-oscillator instrument with dual envelopes and a switchable filter.</p>
      <p>EDP was co-founded by synth designer Chris Huggett, who has since gone on to work for Novation, taking inspiration from the Wasp for that company’s <a href="https://www.musicradar.com/reviews/tech/novation-bass-station-ii-585664"><u>Bass Station II</u></a> synth. However, a direct hardware emulation of the Wasp has never been forthcoming.</p>
      <p>That looks set to change, though, with the word being that Behringer’s clone will be of the Wasp Deluxe, a later version of the synth that featured a proper keyboard (the original’s used flat conductive copper plates).</p>
      <p>If its existence is confirmed, it’ll be the latest in a long line of synth and drum machines revivals from Behringer, the most recent being <a href="https://www.musicradar.com/news/behringers-confirms-the-td-3-its-all-analogue-roland-303-clone"><u>the TD-3, a reboot of Roland’s TB-303 bass synth</u></a>.</p>
