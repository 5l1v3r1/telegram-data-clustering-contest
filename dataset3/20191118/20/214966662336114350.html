      <p>Police say they continue to be pleased with the behaviour of schoolies on the Gold Coast, though the message remains ‘stay safe and watch your mates’.</p>
      <p>After what authorities consider was a successful weekend, only a handful of schoolies were arrested on day 4 yesterday.</p>
      <p>Police report there were only nine schoolies arrested on 10 offences overnight – mainly for drug possession.</p>
      <p>Of those arrested, eight were male and one was a female schoolie.</p>
      <p>The stats are pretty on par with the same night last year – with 9 schoolies also arrested on the same night in 2018.</p>
      <p>Two schoolies were also issued with liquor infringements notices.</p>
      <p>There were 15 non-schoolies arrested on 23 charges relating to public nuisance and drug possession.</p>
