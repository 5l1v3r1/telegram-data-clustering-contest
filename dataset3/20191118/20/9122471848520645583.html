      <h1>Nets Announce New Injury Update For PG Kyrie Irving</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:54:39+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/alekarend" target="_blank">Alek Arend</a></address>
      <p>The Brooklyn Nets made some of the NBA’s most pivotal off-season moves, signing Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving. There’s no doubt this team will be dangerous down the line. But without Durant, the Nets are struggling to win games.</p>
      <p>Brooklyn is currently 5-7 as Irving as had to carry the team on his back for the time being. But according to the latest report, the star guard will miss tonight’s game against the Pacers. It will be Irving’s second straight missed game.</p>
      <p>The Nets guard is dealing with a right shoulder impingement. The severity of the injury is unknown and as of right now, there’s no timeline for his return.</p>

      <p>Hopefully this isn’t long term as Brooklyn still hopes to make the Eastern Conference Playoffs this season.</p>
      <p>The Nets were able to win without Irving against the Bulls on Saturday in a 117-111 victory. Spencer Dinwiddie led the team with 24 points. Dinwiddie will need another big performance for Brooklyn to win on Monday night.</p>
      <p>In 11 games this season, Irving is averaging 28.5 points per game to go along with 7.2 APG and 5.4 RPG. He’s off to a hot start, but the Nets are struggling to win games having won just one of their last four contests.</p>
      <p>Brooklyn plays Indiana on Monday night at 7:30 p.m. ET.</p>
