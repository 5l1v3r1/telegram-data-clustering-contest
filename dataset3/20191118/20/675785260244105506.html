      <p>Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby says Jesus would not have got a UK visa under the points-based system being proposed by the government.</p>
      <p>The clergyman, who has been outspoken about social justice, said there would have to be a "shortage of carpenters" in Britain for Jesus to be granted entry during an event at the CBI conference in London.</p>
      <p>He said: "Our founder Jesus Christ was of course not white, middle class and British - he certainly wouldn't have got a visa - unless we're particularly short of carpenters."</p>
      <p>The Archbishop was talking as part in a discussion on social inequality chaired by the BBC Business Editor Faisal Islam who shared a clip on his <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> feed.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/boris-johnson">Boris Johnson</a> wants to introduce a points-based system which he says would be similar to the way Australia regulates immigration.</p>
      <p>Business Secretary Angela Leadsom said a Conservative-majority government would "be fair to the world" and not just the EU in terms of immigration.</p>
      <p>Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she said: "The immigration rules at the moment allow free movement from all EU nations and then quite significantly tighter rules from the rest of the world."</p>
      <p>She added: "Our immigration rules will be fair to the world once we leave the European Union.</p>
      <p>"What that means is, instead of being open, free-access to benefits, to work and to coming here without a job to the EU but tight for the rest of the world, what we will have is a system that can control the types of workers that we need in our economy, that can be driven by the needs to the UK economy, and that will be fair to the entire world instead of just free movement from the EU."</p>
      <p>The Archbishop has previously faced criticism for becoming involved in political debates.</p>
      <p>But he has robustly defended speaking out about injustice as part of his role describing Jesus has "highly political" in an article on the Huffington Post website earlier this year.</p>
      <p>He said: "He was never party political. No wing of politics – left or right – can claim God as being on its side.</p>
      <p>But Jesus was highly political. He told the rich that, unlike the poor who were blessed, they would face woes.</p>
      <p>"He criticised the King as a fox. He spoke harsh words to leaders of the nations when they were uncaring of the needy."</p>
