Personally, I'd quite like to see him in the jungle. What do you reckon, Piers? Game?</li>

Rather hoping he gets them out again. It did cause quite a stir online…</li>

Day Four is apparently the one to nab when it comes to this job. The constipation has set in and your fellow camper sare eating less calories than a reality star on a dodgy shake diet.</li>

Someone <i>ALWAYS</i> smuggles in contraband. *cough cough* Gillian McKeith – we're looking at you with your sneaky salt and herbs. Caitlyn has surely hidden a lipstick in her ponytail?
