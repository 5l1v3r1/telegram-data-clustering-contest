      <h1>Marvel’s Runaways Will End With Season 3 on Hulu</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:01:31+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:01</time> by <a rel="author">Blair Marnell</a></address>
      <p>Earlier this fall, Kevin Feige <a href="https://www.superherohype.com/movies/469466-kevin-feige-is-now-marvels-chief-creative-officer">assumed total control</a> of Marvel’s publishing and TV empires, in addition to Marvel Studios. Perhaps it’s a coincidence, but one of the last remaining pre-Feige Marvel live-action series is now coming to an end. Via <a href="https://deadline.com/2019/11/marvels-runaways-to-end-season-3-hulu-canceled-final-season-trailer-1202788430/">Deadline</a>, <b>Runaways</b> will be finished on Hulu after season 3. However, that doesn’t mean the Runways’ story will come to an abrupt stop.</p>
      <p>According to the report, “the story is said to come to a natural ending point at the end of season 3.” So there will be closure for the Runaways team, even if another season isn’t in the cards.</p>
      <p>Elizabeth Hurley is joining the cast for season 3 as Morgan le Fay, an ancient sorceress who draws Nico into her dark web. Meanwhile, Chase, Gert, and Karolina are still captured, and their remaining teammates have to save them.</p>

      <p>The end of Runaways means that Marvel’s only remaining live-action show on Hulu is the upcoming <b>Helstrom</b> series. Additionally, Hulu is also planning four Marvel animated series: <b>M.O.D.O.K.</b>, <b>Howard the Duck</b>, <b>Hit-Monkey</b>, and <b>Tigra &amp; Dazzler</b>. All four animated series will crossover in <b>Marvel’s The Offenders</b>.</p>
      <p><b>Runaways</b> season 3 will hit Hulu on December 13.</p>
