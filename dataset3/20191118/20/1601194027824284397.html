      <p>Eden Hazard believes Belgium will head to Euro 2020 stronger than ever and must improve on their third-place finish at the 2018 World Cup.</p>
      <p>Roberto Martinez's side have a 100 per cent record after nine games in qualifying for the European Championship and will seek to finish their campaign with a maximum 30 points against Cyprus on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils finished third in last year's World Cup and lead the FIFA rankings, and Hazard thinks they are better equipped for their next major tournament.</p>
      <p>"We have two years more experience than at the World Cup, two more years with the coach," said Real Madrid star Hazard.</p>
      <p>"We know each other better, we have young players â€¦ I think we are stronger. We have developed the winning mentality that we didn't have enough at Euro 2016 and the World Cup.</p>
      <p>"But if we end up fourth in the European Championship then we will be less strong."</p>

      <p>Belgium have already been touted as potential Euro 2020 winners and Hazard says they deserve to be considered in that category.</p>
      <p>"We are among the favourites, for sure," added Hazard.</p>
      <p>"But we are not alone. France, Italy, Spain, England are also serious opponents."</p>
