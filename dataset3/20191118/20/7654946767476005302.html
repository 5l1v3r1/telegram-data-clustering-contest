      <h1>Skylar Richardson breaks silence for first time since murder trial</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T20:27:18+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 20:27</time> by <a rel="author">Jackie Salo</a></address>
      <p>The former Ohio cheerleader who was <a href="https://nypost.com/2018/05/23/from-teen-queen-to-baby-killer-without-a-trial/">on trial for killing and burying her newborn baby</a> days after prom says her “biggest regret” was keeping her pregnancy a secret.</p>
      <p>Brooke Skylar Richardson, 20, was <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/09/12/brooke-skylar-richardson-bursts-into-tears-receiving-verdict/">found not guilty in September</a> of her baby girl Annabelle’s murder, though she was convicted of abuse of a corpse for burying the child in her parent’s Carlisle backyard in May 2017.</p>
      <p>In her first interview, Richardson said she was “plagued by guilt” for not confiding in anyone that she was pregnant before she delivered what she claims was a stillborn baby, <a href="http://www.cosmopolitan.com/skylar-richardson">Cosmopolitan reported</a>.</p>
      <p>“My biggest regret is not having the strength to tell someone that I was pregnant,” Richardson told the magazine. “I wish I would have done it differently. I’m plagued by guilt every day for not telling someone.”</p>
      <p>During the two years she waited for her trial to begin, Richardson said she was depressed, spending nights thinking of her daughter.</p>
      <p>“Every night, I would lie down and wish that I could have died in place of Annabelle,” Richardson told the outlet.</p>
      <p>Richarson — who walked free after the trial — said she’s still traumatized by the media coverage surrounding the case.</p>
      <p>“I’m still living with a lot of fear,” she told the outlet. “The past two years have been nothing short of a nightmare. After being constantly afraid and paranoid of everyone and everything around me, I’m having a hard time letting that go.”</p>
