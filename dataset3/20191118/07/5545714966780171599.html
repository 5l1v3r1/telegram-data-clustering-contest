      <p>At the Arc Revo Tour finals this weekend, publisher Arc System Works dropped a new trailer for "<i>New Guilty Gear</i>", officially dubbing the upcoming entry of the anime fighting game series <i>Guilty Gear Strive</i>, (stylised as <i>Guilty Gear -Strive-</i> (with <i>Strive</i>'s "IV" denoting the sequel as the franchise's fourth mainline entry.)<br/><br/>The new trailer, which you can check out below, features the re-branding along with a montage of action featuring all of the characters revealed so far, including <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../guilty-gear-reveals-chipp-zanuff-potemkin-and-lengthy-gameplay-video-571390.phtml">Chipp Zanuff</a>, Ky Kysike, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../may-confirmed-for-new-guilty-gear-566765.phtml">May,</a> <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../guilty-gear-reveals-chipp-zanuff-potemkin-and-lengthy-gameplay-video-571390.phtml">Potemkin</a>, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/../axl-low-is-back-to-brawl-in-guilty-gear-gameplay-trailer-569437.phtml">Axl Low</a> and Sol Badguy. The trailer winds up with the return of Faust, one of <i>GG</i>'s weirdest and most recognisable fighters.<br/><br/>Originally appearing in the first <i>Guilty Gear</i> title as Dr. Baldhead, the gangly physician lost his mind after a failed surgery and became Faust, typified by his six-foot scalpel, the paper bag he wears on his head, and his dreamlike world-bending abilities. As with many of the characters announced so far, Faust is a series veteran, and thus was expected to be making an appearance in the new title.<br/><br/>The next trailer for <i>Guilty Gear Strive</i> is expected at the Frosty Faustings tournament in January, <i>Guilty Gear Strive</i> is set to launch on PS4 sometime in 2020.</p>
