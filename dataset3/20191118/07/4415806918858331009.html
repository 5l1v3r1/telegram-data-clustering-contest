      <p>A 13-year-old girl is in a critical condition after a machete attack at a house in Co. Fermanagh at the weekend.</p>
      <p>A 41-year-old woman was also treated for stab wounds to her leg.</p>
      <p>Police say a number of men armed with machetes broke into a house at Trasna Way in Lisnaskea at about 9.15pm on Saturday night and attacked the girl and the woman.</p>
      <p>A baby was also at the scene but was unharmed.</p>
      <p>No arrests have been made and police are treating the investigation as attempted murder</p>
      <p>Speaking to ITV News, the baby's grandmother, Elizabeth Joyce, said the young girl tried to save his life.</p>
      <p>She said: "They burst through the house, one attacker came to me attacking. I was screaming and kicking and fighting back. The other attacker went for the wee fella, but his auntie, who is in hospital in a very critical condition, she threw herself on top of the baby to save the baby's life."</p>
      <p>PSNI Detective Sergeant Keith Monaghan said: “This must have been a terrifying ordeal for those involved and we are determined to find the men responsible. We have several lines of enquiry which we are progressing at this time but I would ask anyone with information or who noticed any suspicious activity in the area to contact detectives in Enniskillen and pass that information on.”</p>
      <p>Alliance Fermanagh representative Matthew Beaumont said whoever carried out an attack in Lisnaskea needs to be caught quickly.</p>
