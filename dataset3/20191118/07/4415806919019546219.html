      <h1>Index finds couples on high mortgage rates work an extra day a month to pay debt</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T07:42:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 07:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.breakingnews.ie/author/digital-desk-staff/" target="_blank">By Digital Desk staff</a></address>
      <p>Couples on high mortgage rates are working the equivalent of one day a month to fund the extra payment.</p>
      <p>A new report from Doddl.ie has found that the difference between the highest and lowest interest rates on the market has now grown to 2.25% or around €291 per month.</p>
      <p>Couples on the highest interest rate are working nine hours every month just to service this unnecessary debt</p>
      <p>The gap between the lowest mortgage rate at 2.25% and the highest at 4.5% has widened to 27% from 21% at the same stage last year, and this means that some mortgage holders are needlessly paying twice as much interest on their mortgage.</p>
      <p>It also found that mortgage holders could save almost €3,500 a year by switching lender.</p>
      <p>The highest rate of repayment on the average 25 year mortgage as at Q3 2019 is €1,353.52, while mortgage holders on the lowest non-discounted rate are paying €1,062.03.</p>
      <p>The Index is based on the average mortgage drawn down for new lending in both the first-time buyer and second-hand mover markets, currently €243,512.</p>
      <p>The doddl Index looks at the total number of switcher transactions per quarter as a percentage of all home loan transactions, excluding Buy to Let mortgages, to give an accurate picture of principal private dwelling house credit.</p>
      <p>Managing Director of doddl.ie, Martina Hennessy, said: “The perfect example of how this disparity in rates affects people is a married couple, both earning the average wage of €38,871, with an after-tax income of €62,111.</p>
      <p>“If these mortgage holders are on the highest variable rate they will be working over nine hours a month to repay the additional interest of €3,498 per annum.</p>
      <p>“One member of the couple could take almost three weeks off unpaid a year and be in the same net financial position simply by switching to the lowest rate.</p>
      <blockquote>Sticking with a lender who is charging you a higher rate than you can achieve on market does not make sense.</blockquote>
      <p>“The impact of lower interest rates is significant – mortgage holders on the highest rates can reduce their term by a full six years on a 25-year mortgage simply by switching to the 2.25% rate and making the same repayments.</p>
      <p>“Mortgage terms of up to 70 years at expiry are offered to first-time buyers so revisiting initial terms is an opportunity to switch, reduce the interest paid and their mortgage term and make a huge impact on the overall cost of credit."</p>
      <p>Mortgage switching transactions increased by almost 14% against the same period in 2018, but the latest figures show that mortgage switchers are still responding to single marketing messages from banks.</p>
      <p>“Banks have been criticised for penalising their existing customers for their loyalty by offering lower rates to new customers,” said Ms Hennessy.</p>
      <p>“Despite this, the latest Banking &amp; Payments Federation Ireland figures show that 66.4% of mortgage switching was direct as opposed to via the broker market.</p>
      <p>“This shows that mortgage holders are reacting to a single marketing message from a bank rather than seeking out impartial advice on the best value and options on the market via a professional broker."</p>
