      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/chelsea-fc/">Chelsea</a> were working on a deal to bring Sergio Aguero to the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/premier-league/">Premier League</a> before he joined <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-city-fc/">Manchester City</a> only for skipper John Terry to advise against signing him.</p>
      <p>The Argentine striker moved to Manchester in 2011 and has been one of the division’s all-time most prolific players, scoring 173 goals – he is just two goals behind Thierry Henry in sixth place, and four behind Frank Lampard.</p>
      <p>He has helped City win four Premier League titles and the FA Cup, but he very nearly moved to Stamford Bridge instead of the Etihad.</p>

      <p><a href="https://theathletic.com/1383439/2019/11/18/why-chelsea-missed-out-on-signing-aguero-despite-making-him-a-target-in-2009/">According to <i>The Athletic</i></a>, Chelsea made their first enquiry for Aguero two years before he joined City, though were initially put off by the transfer fee and salary demands.</p>
      <p>Negotiations resumed while Carlo Ancelotti was in charge, but captain Terry – who, along with a number of key personnel at the time, wielded a huge amount of influence – vetoed the deal.</p>

      <p>Terry was reportedly not a huge fan of the diminutive Argentine having played against him twice in the Champions League.</p>
      <p>The English centre-back is said to have been unimpressed by Aguero’s movement and passed on his critique to Chelsea’s hierarchy.</p>
      <p>He also suggested that the club should sign David Villa – who was still at Valencia at the time – ahead of Aguero and even namechecked the Spaniard after winning the FA Cup Final in 2009.</p>

      <p>But Villa moved to Barcelona, winning the Champions League, while Chelsea’s interest in Aguero cooled after Terry’s assessment – though they did try and sign him again before he opted for City.</p>
      <p>Ironically, Aguero had scored twice against a Terry-led Chelsea defence with Atletico before moving to City and has been prolific against the west Londoners ever since, scoring 15 times against the Blues in 18 appearances – there is no side in the Premier League he has scored more times against.</p>
