      <p>CHOREOGRAPHER Scott Elstermann’s latest work <i>Act 2, Scenes 1-4</i> takes a leaf out of director Wes Anderson’s films, in particular <i>The Grand Budapest Hotel</i>.</p>
      <p>“I was watching the film one day and thought it was very choreographic in the way it was edited,” Elstermann, of Kardinya, said.</p>
      <p>“I thought it would be an interesting experiment to put the film conventions on to dancers.</p>
      <p>“The dancers re-enact different conventions through their bodies such as slow motion and claymation stop-motion animation.</p>
      <p>“Each little scene or vignette in my work is layered with a different convention, so for example in the claymation, the dancers become the clay figurines that twitch on and off in small increments. It goes for three minutes and they make it look very easy but it’s incredibly difficult to do.”</p>
      <p>Elstermann will present the work at The Blue Room Theatre in theatrical dance double-header <i>BANG! BANG!</i> with his former WAAPA contemporary dance lecturer Shona Erskine.</p>

      <p>Elstermann graduated from WAAPA in 2014 and was invited by Erskine to perform the following year in her first full-length work <i>White Matter</i>.</p>
      <p>“Since then I’ve continued to work with Shona on different developments and she’s been a mentor for me on various projects,” the 25-year-old said.</p>
      <p>“It’s a pleasure to be able to present a show alongside her. I will perform in her work <i>Love You, Stranger</i>, which is the first half of the double bill, and then my work makes up the second half.</p>
      <p>“My work is quite melodramatic and comical and Shona’s is quite atmospheric and ambient but both works kind of look at this idea of murder and drama in different ways.</p>
      <p>“We thought it would make a great double bill to see both sides of what contemporary dance can be and the various colours and flavours you can get.”</p>
      <p>Erskine’s piece is based on three Australian women from history who killed their partner; one who got away with the murder and two who did not.</p>
      <p>“We thought <i>BANG! BANG!</i> was a fun, catchy title,” Elstermann said.</p>
      <p>“We knew both works had murder in them, and since it’s a double bill, audiences are getting two bangs for their buck. It should be super entertaining and a different take on the usual contemporary dance aesthetic.”</p>
