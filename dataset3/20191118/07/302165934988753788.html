      <p>TOKYO, Nov 18 — Almost a fifth of Japanese households use electronic money for small purchases, a survey by a central bank-affiliated research institute showed, up from a year ago and a sign the country’s cash-hoarding culture is changing.</p>
      <p>In the survey published today and conducted between June and July, 18.5% of households said they use electronic money, such as smartphone apps and debit card payments, on shopping trips where ¥1,000 (US$9.17) or less is spent, up from 15.4% in the previous year.</p>
      <p>Among single-person households — 43% of whom are in their 20s and 30s — the ratio was much higher at 35.6%, suggesting government efforts to prod Japanese to go cashless may be paying off, at least among the younger generation.</p>
      <p>Despite the growth in electronic payments, Japan’s “cash-is-king” mentality remains entrenched with the survey showing 84% still use notes and coins for small purchases.</p>
      <p>And for payments exceeding ¥10,000 and up to ¥50,000, 48.5% of households said they pay by cash and 3.4% by electronic money, the survey showed.</p>
      <p>A low crime rate, years of ultra-low interest rates and a nationwide network of automatic-teller machines (ATMs) have long made cash appealing in Japan, giving people few reasons to shift to cashless payments.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is pushing to make more Japanese switch to cashless payments to allow stores to automate sales estimates and banks to cut back on costly ATMs.</p>
      <p>Shoppers have recently been encouraged to ditch cash for e-money after the government introduced a rebate programme to ease the pain of a sales tax hike on October 1. — Reuters</p>
