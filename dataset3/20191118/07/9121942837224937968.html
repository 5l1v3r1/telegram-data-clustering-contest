      <p>PARIS (AP) — Authorities say a bridge has collapsed in rural southwest France, killing a 15-year-old girl and leaving at least one person missing.</p>
      <p>Toulouse prosecutor Dominique Alzeari said the girl’s mother was rescued by witnesses after several vehicles, including hers, fell into the Tarn River on Monday morning near the village of Mirepoix-sur-Tarn.</p>
      <p>He said rescuers were still searching for a truck driver whose vehicle also fell in the river. He said five people were injured in the collapse, including two firefighters at the scene.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Edouard Philippe, on a visit to Senegal, deplored the “tragic accident.” The bridge had been renovated in 2003 and its last safety check was in 2017.</p>
      <p>An investigation into the cause of the collapse has been opened.</p>
