      <h1>PSG reportedly want to replace Edinson Cavani with Liverpool man Adam Lallana</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T07:54:31+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 07:54</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/mattaddison/" target="_blank">Matt Addison</a></address>
      <p>French champions PSG have reportedly made Liverpool’s Adam Lallana a target for the upcoming transfer window.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/liverpool-midfielder-adam-lallana-psgs-20896197">Daily Mirror</a>, Edinson Cavani has agreed to replace Zlatan Ibrahimovic at LA Galaxy, and Lallana is the man that Thomas Tuchel wants to bring in to replace him.</p>
      <p>With his contract set to expire next summer, Lallana is free to sign a pre-contract agreement with any club abroad from the turn of the year, though he could yet sign an extension at Anfield given how much Jurgen Klopp likes him.</p>
      <p>As per the report, clubs in China and MLS have also been linked with Lallana over the last few weeks but Klopp does not want to lose him just yet – certainly not halfway through the campaign.</p>
      <p>At the age of 31 and on a basic wage of £65,000 per week according to the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/liverpool-player-wages-revealed-mohamed-14173557">Daily Mirror</a>, it would be no surprise to see Lallana leave next summer in search of more game time.</p>
      <p>Whether that would come at PSG, though, is perhaps unlikely. He’s hardly a direct replacement for Cavani, either, so it’s a bit of a weird story.</p>
