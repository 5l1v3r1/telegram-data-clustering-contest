      <h1>Is this £62 Easirent admin fee the greediest yet?</h1>

        <b>I write to alert your readers to the extraordinary behaviour of the car hire firm Easirent’s Dublin airport branch. Having paid £48 for the three-day hire, I was talked into taking out extra insurance which would reduce the damage excess to zero – for which I paid £14</b>
        <b>2.</b>

        <b>The estate car I had booked was not available so we were upgraded to a seven-seater I was told was so new it was unlikely to have any damage on it. As soon as I returned the vehicle, the same agent immediately noted scuff marks to the wing mirror, but assured me that, as I had paid for the insurance, I would not be charged. Then came the bombshell – there was a €70, or £62, admin charge to process this supposedly “new damage”. I have complained to no avail, and have since found terrible reviews of this company.</b>

      <p>I have been writing about car hire firms for 15 years and thought I had seen every hidden charge in the book, but this admin fee is arguably the greediest yet.</p>
      <p>The company says you would have been told about the admin fee when you bought its absurdly over-priced extra insurance (£142 for a three-day rental, really?) and signed the forms, and therefore it stands.</p>
      <p>It claimed that the fee represents the costs of having repairs carried out, and that its competitors all do it, too. I asked for the evidence that your vehicle was repaired but none has been presented. Based on my conversation with the press person and what I have since read <a href="https://uk.trustpilot.com/review/www.easirent.com?languages=en&amp;stars=1">on review sites</a>, I would not personally go anywhere near Easirent.</p>
      <p>If you are thinking of hiring a car from this firm, I would strongly urge you to look at its T&amp;Cs and its long list of extra fees and charges – and what <a href="https://www.reviews.co.uk/company-reviews/store/easirent">previous customers say</a>. If you have any sense you will take your business elsewhere.</p>
      <p>I have a colleague who flies through Dublin frequently and says the mainstream companies are relatively good value, making it all the more pointless to use one of these off-airport supposedly low-cost providers.</p>
