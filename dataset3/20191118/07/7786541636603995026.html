      <p><b>DUBAI, United Arab EmiratesÂ (AP)</b> - Abu Dhabi's flagship carrier Etihad has partnered with Boeing to launch what they say will be one of the world's most fuel-efficient long haul airplanes as the company seeks to save costs on fuel and position itself as a more environmentally-conscious choice for travelers.</p>
      <p>Etihad's "Greenliner" is a 787 Dreamliner that will depart on its first route from Abu Dhabi to Brussels next year. Etihad's CEO Tony Douglas described the aircraft as a flying laboratory for testing that could benefit the entire industry.</p>
      <p>As fuel costs eat up a quarter of airline spending, Douglas said Monday the goal of the Greenliner is to be 20% more fuel efficient than other aircraft in Etihad's fleet.</p>
      <p>Aviation accounts for a small but rapidly growing share of greenhouse-gas emissions - about 2.5% worldwide.</p>
