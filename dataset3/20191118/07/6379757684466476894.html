      <p>Caravans made no secret of their intention to amass an imposing total in the Group A’s clash, once they won the toss and chose to start batting, given they scored 178 runs for the loss of five wickets in 20 overs.</p>
      <p>Impressive batting displays by opener Ivan Ismail was instrumental in Caravans’ ability to record the huge score, given the talented player notched 84 runs, which consisted of five fours and as many sixes.</p>
      <p>His impressive showing at the crease, eventually, won him man of the match prize.</p>
      <p>Mohamed Omary, who opened the innings with Ismail, also had no mercy for Gymkhana bowlers, blasting 42 runs, which included two fours.</p>
      <p>There was also meaningful contribution with the bat from Jitin Singh and Sreejith Kumar that notched 20 runs and 15 runs respectively.</p>
      <p>Abhik Patwa was Gymkhana’s only bowler with impressive spell, given he took four wickets for 26 runs in four overs.</p>
      <p>Needing 179 runs to win, Gymkhana started the chase in an impressive fashion, given opening batsmen Yakesh Patel and Patwa forged a solid partnership, posting 50 runs and 25 runs respectively.</p>
      <p>Patel, who ended as the side’s top run getter, blasted five sixes during his spell at the crease, Patwa’s score included two fours and as many sixes.</p>
      <p>Vishal Patel, batting at number three, improved Gymkhana’s chase with his 45 runs that consisted of a boundary and four sixes.</p>
      <p>They experienced batting collapse after Patel’s dismissal, frustrating their efforts to realize successful chase in the process.</p>
      <p>Yash Hirwania led Caravans’ bowling onslaught, finishing his spell with four wickets, conceding one run in four overs.</p>
      <p>He was ably assisted by Jitin Singh and Gokul Das, who ended their respective spells with two wickets apiece.</p>
      <p>Singh leaked 23 runs in four overs, Das leaked 16 runs in four overs</p>
      <p>It was a second win in a row for Caravans, the competition’s defending champions, given they opened their campaign with 123-run rout of Union Sports Club.</p>
      <p>Caravans Club has organized the competition under the supervision of Dar es Salaam Regional Cricket Committee (DRCC), aiming at developing the sport at the domestic level.</p>
      <p>The competition’s sponsors include Petrofuel, Alliance Insurance, Grand Restaurant, Colourflex, RAS Logistics and SBC through Pepsi brand.</p>
