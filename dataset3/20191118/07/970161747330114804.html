      <p>The chill is setting in, the décor is getting a whole lot sparklier and the speakers seem to be wired to only play Mariah Carey.</p>
      <p>These three vital clues mean it’s festive season, so it’s now socially acceptable to dedicate an entire afternoon to nibbling mini sandwiches and gulping down mulled wine in some of the city’s most picturesque venues.</p>
      <p>Here’s our pick of the best Christmas afternoon teas in London.</p>
      <h3>For music</h3>

      <p>You’ll feel revitalised and ready for the busy holiday season after treating yourself The Corinthia’s champagne packages and kicking back to the hotel pianist tickling the ivories.</p>
      <p>The festive afternoon tea is guaranteed to fill you up with an array of finger sandwiches including poached salmon, roast turkey and cranberry, and salt beef, horseradish cream and watercress.</p>
