      <p>Stanbic Bank doesn’t want you to spend long hours in the Queues. That’s why they are serious about their digital banking platforms. To prove it, South African-based Standard bank through Stanbic Bank is continuously adding new innovative features to their web and mobile banking platforms which we have extensively <a href="https://www.dignited.com/33160/stanbic-bank-mobile-and-internet-banking-platforms/">reviewed</a> before.</p>
      <p>The latest features to the Stanbic bank Mobile App is the even more convenient PIN authentication. While you can use username/email and password combo, they are a lot harder to remember than a 5-digit pin. To add App code or PIN authentication, simply tap on more &gt;&gt; settings &gt;&gt; Sign-in preferences &gt;&gt; Add Sign-in method, then select Android PIN.</p>
      <p>Next time you are logging in, the app will present all the other available options including fingerprint, password and PIN. You can remove the sign up preference by following similar steps to adding one.</p>
      <p>The other cool update to the Stanbic Bank App is the ability to block a card. This could be helpful for a number of reasons; your wallet/card could be misplaced or stolen, so you don’t want the bad guys to use your card either at the ATM or via Online transactions. To block a card, tap on Manage &gt;&gt; Cards &gt;&gt; select card &gt;&gt; Switch your card on and off. Under card settings, you can also control if you want to use your card at ATMs, for online purchases and checking out at Point of Sale(PoS) terminals.</p>
      <p>While the ATM will ask for the PIN, doing online transactions only requires the the Card number, expiry date and CVV all of which are printed on the card. So it’s very important to block a card when its stolen or misplaced. Of course, you could call the bank to do that for you as well.</p>
      <p>As a Stanbic Bank customers, I am constantly on the lookout for features that make my life easy. Stanbic has a “mobile money like ” feature called Instant Money which enables you send money to anyone with just a phone. However, this feature is only available on the ATMs and the Bank’s USSD shortcode *290# but not on the Mobile App! This has been a feature request for me for a while now, but Stanbic hasn’t yet added it.</p>
      <p>Other features available on the app include Airtime purchase, paying electricity/yaka, water, Pay TV subscription, URA/KCCA taxes and ability to send money to your registered MTN/Airtel Mobile money number.</p>
