      <h1>Liam Gallagher’s Twitter account is why we don’t have an Oasis reunion</h1>

      <p>Noel Gallagher has blamed his brother’s Twitter account for a lack of Oasis reunion, as Liam continued to slam his sibling on social media.</p>
      <p>With Liam still keen to get the band back together – after their rather acrimonious split in 2009 – Noel has rubbished the idea.</p>
      <p>The High Flying Birds artist has claimed every <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2016/03/18/whats-that-noel-liam-gallagher-expertly-trolls-brother-noel-on-twitter-5760762/">message his brother posts to Twitter</a> about the palaver is a ‘nail in the coffin’ of a potential revival of the 90s and 00s band that catapulted the pair to stardom.</p>
      <p>And while the guitarist and songwriter said his younger sibling would put his life on hold to reunite the band, Noel wouldn’t get on stage with his brother anytime soon, calling Liam a ‘moron’ if he thinks otherwise.</p>

      <p>Well, the Gallagher men have never glossed over their true feelings, have they?</p>

      <p>It came to a head earlier this year when Liam became embroiled in a feud with his sister-in-law Sara MacDonald, and was alleged to have<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/07/03/liam-gallagher-sends-threatening-text-message-noels-daughter-anais-tell-step-mam-careful-10110226/"> sent threatening messages via Noel’s daughter Anais,</a> which said: ‘Tell your step mam to be very careful [sic].’</p>
      <p>Noel defended his wife and said his brother’s comments were destroying the chances of an Oasis reunion.</p>
      <p>‘It’s strange behaviour for someone who is gagging for me to pick up the phone and say let’s do it,’ he told The Big Issue.</p>

      <p>‘He’d put his whole life on hold to get Oasis back together.</p>
      <p>‘But every tweet he sends out its another nail in the coffin of that idea.’</p>
      <p>Noel then addressed Liam directly in the interview, as he added: ‘If you think for one minute I am going to share a stage with you after what you’ve said you are f*cking more of a moron than you look.’</p>
      <p>While people apparently keep trying to tell Noel he is loved by his brother, he believed it came from ‘a place of hate’.</p>
      <p>His comments come after Noel said he’d <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/07/noel-gallagher-would-rather-have-entertaining-boris-johnson-as-a-brother-than-liam-11056488/">rather have Boris Johnson as a brother than Liam</a>.</p>
      <p>‘I would say Boris is more entertaining,’ he previously told The Daily Star. ‘His use of the English language is more superior.’</p>
      <p>However, he did admit that his younger brother was ‘better looking’, and he probably would not be able to get on with either him or Boris – which is a tad awkward.</p>

      <p>However, the 52-year-old did admit that the feud between him and Liam has become ‘exhausting’.</p>
      <p>‘He insults my wife a lot,’ he continued. ‘It is nothing to do with her at all. And he threatens my kids and it all gets a bid stupid. Liam has got how many kids? Officially? Four I believe.</p>
      <p>‘Nobody has got married yet so the situation has never arisen.’</p>
