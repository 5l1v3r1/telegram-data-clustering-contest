      <p><b>Michele Pirro is a warrior, but he had to raise the white flag today.</b> The test rider from Puglia doesn't get many chances to race in the MotoGP, so he wants to take advantage of every opportunity he can. Unfortunately, he had to give this up in Valencia.<b> Although he was weak from the flu, he wanted to line up for the Grand Prix but, at the end of lap 4, he had to bring his Ducati back to the pit-box.</b></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>"<i>It definitely wasn't a positive Sunday for us. My race was ruined by a physical problem because I didn't feel well right from</i> <i>the start</i>," "Pirro said<i><b>. "My pressure was already low when I started and I was also nauseous, so I preferred to stop and go back. I feel bad because my goal was to finish in the top ten. I could've done it and maybe even something better. Unfortunately, that's how things went. We'll try again next year</b></i>."</p>
