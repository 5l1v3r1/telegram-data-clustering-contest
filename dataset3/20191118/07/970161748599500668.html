      <p>Because of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/01/why-were-talking-about-debt-this-month-11017937/">the stigma surrounding debt</a>, it’s common to feel unable to share money problems with others.</p>
      <p>Having debt can trigger feelings of shame, making us reluctant to open up to the people closest to us, such as romantic partners.</p>
      <p>We want them to see us at our best, and because discussing personal finances isn’t the norm, we hold back.</p>
      <p>This can have a serious affect on relationships, and it can also make it harder to get the situation under control if your other half has no idea what’s going on.</p>
      <p>According to recent statistics by <a href="https://www.portafina.co.uk/">Portafina</a>, nearly half of Brits won’t <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/debt-month/">talk about debt</a> with their partner.</p>
      <p>It’s rated as the least favourable topic to discuss overall, with millennials the age group least likely to bring it up in conversation (44.8%).</p>

      <p>To be truly intimate with someone and build a trusting relationship, you’re better off being upfront.</p>
      <p>In other words, it’s time to tell your significant other about your debt. So, how can you do this?</p>
      <h3>How to tell a partner you’re in debt</h3>
      <p>Let’s cover something first: there are different stages of relationships.</p>
      <p>You’re not obliged to provide a detailed list of income and outgoings to someone you’ve only been on a few dates with or that person you’ve been on-again, off-again with for the past three months.</p>
      <p>However, if you’re in a committed, serious relationship, it’s recommended that you share your financial concerns.</p>
      <p>‘It may feel like a difficult conversation to start, but you’re not alone,’ Catherine Winter, managing director of financial capability at <a href="https://www.libf.ac.uk/">The London Institute of Banking &amp; Finance</a>, tells Metro.co.uk.</p>
      <p>‘Being in debt is stressful, but tackling it early is vital to ensure it doesn’t spiral.</p>
      <p>‘One way to kick off the conversation is to suggest that you might both get more out of your money by doing a budget. You start that by listing your spending, regular bills and essential payments (such as for debt), against your income.</p>
      <p>‘You may then immediately see where you could save money, and it could provide an opportunity to talk about debt and ways to tackle that.’</p>
      <p>If your partner isn’t aware of your debt, they won’t take it into consideration when making plans with you, meaning you might get stuck in a cycle of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/12/why-are-people-getting-themselves-into-socialising-debt-11077475/">‘socialising debt’</a> – spending money for expensive outings, food or clothes because you’re afraid of missing out.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>However, if you’ve only been together a short while and don’t share any financial burdens, discussing a budget may not be the best solution.</p>
      <p>If that’s the case, start by sitting the other person down in a space where you both feel comfortable and safe, and reveal your debt issues.</p>
      <p>Take your time, explain the situation and ask your partner to simply listen until you’re finished talking (they should do that anyway, but saying it out loud will make the other person aware that this is a sensitive conversation).</p>
      <p>Depending on your amount of debt, it could impact on your life together, so after you’ve told them, allow your partner a moment to take in this information.</p>
      <p>‘Your financial situation can impact on your partner, especially if it could affect both of your credit scores and potentially stop you from being approved for mortgages or loans in the future,’ said Salman Haqqi, personal finance expert at <a href="https://www.money.co.uk/">Money.co.uk</a>, a financial products comparison site.</p>
      <p>‘If you have a debt problem it’s best to grit your teeth and tell your partner, like ripping off a plaster.</p>
      <p>‘Discussing your financial troubles will let them put some perspective on the situation, and they can help you work out the best solution.’</p>
      <p>Prepare yourself for several possible outcomes before this talk takes place.</p>
      <p>Hopefully, if you’re with a partner who respects and cares for you – which, for the record, you should be – they will be grateful for your honesty and offer their love and support.</p>

      <p>Beatrice*, 25, has been in debt since she was 18 years old – sometimes it’s a few hundred pounds and occasionally it has gone up to several thousand.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>When she told her long-term boyfriend about it, she found out that he too is in debt.</p>
      <p>‘I’ve been with my partner for about two years now, and I’ve been in differing amounts of debt for most of that time.</p>
      <p>‘Of course you have the honeymoon period where nothing too serious gets spoken about, but when we decided we wanted to move in together, I knew I had to come clean about my financial situation and what I could reasonably afford.</p>
      <p>‘When I did, it came out that he was in the exact same situation as me and it was a huge weight off both of our shoulders.</p>
      <p>‘I was nervous about talking about it. I’ve seen people online say they’d never go out with someone who was in debt, as it could affect joint mortgages or they think it shows bad character.</p>
      <p>‘My boyfriend would have been within his rights to think that, but I’d rather be honest and be judged, than lie.</p>
      <p>‘You shouldn’t bury your head in the sand about debt to yourself anyway, so when you’re with a partner long-term it’s necessary to talk about what you owe rather than ignoring it.’</p>
      <h3>How to ask a partner if they are in debt</h3>
      <p>By not telling your partner you risk them finding out on their own.</p>
      <p>This could raise alarm bells in their mind, because if you’re hiding this from them, they might start to question other aspects of the relationship.</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘A few years back, I was in a relationship with someone who was getting calls from unknown numbers (which I later found out were debt collectors) during our dates, and acted shady about money,’ Shannon*, 31, tells us.</p>
      <p>‘So, one day, when he’d left me alone in his flat, I took a look at some letters that were scattered on his kitchen table – and figured out that he owed thousands to different debt collection agencies.</p>
      <p>‘I was less concerned about the debt, and more about the fact we had been talking about our future together and that he had been lying to me about the severity of his problems.</p>
      <p>‘In the end, we broke up. His debt wasn’t the only reason, or even the main reason, but it ruined the trust we had and I found myself constantly worrying about whether there were other skeletons in his closet.’</p>
      <p>If you suspect that your boyfriend or girlfriend is in debt, you can – and should – absolutely talk to them about it.</p>
      <p>Should you find out they’ve been outright lying to you about debt, then you are allowed to be angry and to voice this anger, but try to avoid accusatory tones.</p>
      <p>This will likely only make them less inclined to open up to you, and there might be a reason why they’ve hidden it from you (again, shame) – so if you value the relationship, let the worst of the anger pass before you sit down to talk.</p>
      <p>Salman says: ‘If you think your partner is hiding debt, you might be able to spot signs like a change in their spending habits, or they might be secretive, or seem anxious or depressed.</p>
      <p>‘Find a time when you both have no plans or distractions, and ask them outright whether they are having money problems.</p>
      <p>‘If they are, it’s important to be understanding of their feelings, whatever your emotions are about the situation.’</p>
      <p>Once you have all the information – and if you choose to stay together – make a plan.</p>
      <p>Go through the debt in detail and figure out how it can be resolved, but be careful not to make your entire relationship about the debt.</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/03/how-to-support-someone-who-is-in-debt-without-giving-them-money-11019747/">You can offer to help pay off some of the debt by loaning your partner money</a>, if you want, but be vary of using this as a solution – it could create more problems in the long-run.</p>
      <p>There’s more to your relationship than money.</p>
