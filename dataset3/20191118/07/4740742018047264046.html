      <h1>Man raging at 'shocking' state of Bristol pavements reveals mission to get them all fixed</h1>
      <h2>Raymond Rose says he got every footpath fixed in Basingstoke - and plans to do the same in Bristol</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T07:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Conor Gogarty</a></address>
      <p>A Southmead pensioner says he is on a mission to get every last pavement in Bristol repaired.</p>
      <p>Raymond Rose, of Bradwell Grove, claims he has inundated <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/bristol-city-council">Bristol City Council</a> with complaints about the condition of footpaths over the last 12 months, but says none have been addressed.</p>
      <p>Though the 71-year-old believes “the whole of Bristol is in a shocking state with its pavements”, he deems the following four to be the worst:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Union Street in the city centre</li>
        <li>The Horsefair in Broadmead</li>
        <li>Greystoke Avenue in <a href="https://www.bristolpost.co.uk/all-about/southmead">Southmead</a></li>
        <li>Doncaster Road in Southmead.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Mr Rose said: “I came to Bristol nine years ago from Basingstoke. I got every footpath that you could think of fixed there.”</p>

      <p>But the retired landscape gardener has accused Bristol City Council of being less responsive to complaints than Hampshire County Council.</p>
      <p>“Bristol has the worst council in the whole country,” he said.</p>
      <p>“When I call up, they just fob me off and never seem to do anything.”</p>
      <h3>'Worse by the day'</h3>

      <p>He believes the stretch of pavement most in need of repair is that on Union Street near the Royal British Legion shop.</p>
      <p>Mr Rose said: “The slabs are all broken and sticking up. It slants, so the water drains down and there is a big puddle all the time.</p>

      <p>“There are broken slabs all the way around Primark in Broadmead. All they seem to do is put a little bit of tarmac in. It needs to be all ripped up and redone properly.”</p>
      <p>Asked if it puts him off coming into the city centre, he replied: “Not half.</p>

      <p>“They did all that work around Temple Meads but it seems like they don’t care about the city centre. It’s getting worse by the day.”</p>
      <p>Pavements in disrepair are particularly problematic for Mr Rose because his wife Susan, 70, uses a wheelchair due to hip problems.</p>

      <p>He said: “I have to push her everywhere. It’s very, very difficult all around Bristol.</p>
      <p>“My wife is really disgusted by the whole issue. I am finding it hard because I’m 71 and I have to push her over these obstacles.</p>
      <p>“It’s a big problem for people in wheelchairs and on scooters going across the pavements.”</p>
