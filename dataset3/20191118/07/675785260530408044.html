      <h2>Arsenal and Man Utd are both looking far afield in a big to strengthen their squads in January after tough starts to the Premier League season</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T07:02:39+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 07:02</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Manchester United and Arsenal are reportedly amongst the clubs taking the chance to monitor the next generation of South American talent.</p>
      <p>According to Portuguese newspaper <a href="https://www.record.pt/">Record</a> , both clubs had scouts in attendance in Gran Canaria last week to watch the Tenerife Tournament.</p>
      <p>The four-day event was being used by Under-23 teams from Brazil, Argentina, Chile and the USA to prepare for the 2020 CONMEBOL Pre-Olympic Tournament.</p>
      <p>And whilst no specific names have been mentioned, both were keen to run the rule over any potential gems who could strengthen their side moving forwards.</p>
      <p>For <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> , it was also a chance to keep a close eye on their youngster, Gabriel Martinelli, as he featured for Brazil after earning his first international call-up.</p>

      <p>Arsenal have already hit the jackpot by raiding Brazil, picking up Martinelli from lowly Ituano for a bargain £5m fee and they will hope he could help convince some team-mates to join him.</p>
      <p>They appear keen to repeat the trick with reports suggesting they have met with the father of Flamengo prospect Reinier to try and convince him to join the club.</p>

      <p>They do face competition, however, with Paris Saint-Germain, <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> amongst those all said to be interested in the £17million-rated 17-year-old.</p>
      <p>United, meanwhile, have had a mixed record with Brazilian players in the past, with the likes of Kleberson, Anderson, and current midfielders Fred and Andreas Pereira having limited success at Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>But that hasn't stopped them monitoring some highly-rated players, as well as seeing the best that Argentina, Chile and USA have to offer at that age group.</p>
      <p>It was Argentina who emerged as winners in the tournament, with Boca Juniors midfielder Nicolas Capaldo, 19, scoring the winner in a 1-0 triumph over Brazil in the final.</p>
