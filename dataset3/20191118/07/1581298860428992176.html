      <p>The Restore Hope Foundation received a $500 donation from Commonwealth Bank Esperance on Thursday, November 14, to help support struggling families over Christmas.</p>
      <p>The volunteer led organisation runs a soup kitchen providing free food deliveries twice a week, and in-kind support to local families doing it tough.</p>
      <p>Commonwealth Bank Esperance branch manager Larissa Beeby said the branch voted to support the Restore Hope Foundation because of their dedication to the local community.</p>
      <p>"With the festive season approaching, it's a timely opportunity for us to show our support for Restore Hope Foundation," Ms Beeby said.</p>
      <p>"In particular, we are thrilled to be able to make a contribution towards their annual toy drive, especially at this time of year.</p>
      <p>"It's great to be able to give back and support this work."</p>
      <p>Restore Hope Foundation director Ben Pratt said the donation would assist volunteers to distribute toys collected from the annual Esperance Toy Run and Christmas hampers to families in need.</p>
      <p>"We get a good team together to wrap the toys and we get some monetary donations to go towards hampers for the Christmas period and we do a delivery right before Christmas," he said.</p>
      <p>Foundation chairman Mick Robertson said the donation allowed the group to reach more families over the festive season.</p>
      <p>"We are always pretty grateful to people who donate to Restore Hope because that's our lifeblood," he said.</p>
      <p>"We don't get anything other than the satisfaction of helping people."</p>
      <p>The donation was part of a national program from Commonwealth Bank which pledged to donate $500,000 to organisations making a difference in their community.</p>
