      <p>The online music streaming service Spotify has introduced a new feature called ‘Soundtrack Your Ride’ that will generate a road trip playlist automatically for its users.</p>
      <p>To generate the play list, the website asks the starting point and ending point of the users journey to calculate the length of the trip.</p>
      <p>Then answer a few questions that gather information such as whom the user is travelling with, favourite genre for a road trip and so on. Finally, the user will be asked about the type of vehicle for the road trip, <i>Engadget </i>reported recently.</p>
      <p>When it is done, Spotify will compile a playlist that lasts the length of the journey, and save it to the playlists section of the app. However, the feature is limited to the United States as of now.</p>
      <p>Recently, Spotify launched a dedicated app for children, called Spotify Kids, which would allow kids above three to listen to their own music, both online and offline. The Spotify Kids app gives children access to about 6,000 tracks, all of which, the company, says have been specifically chosen for children.</p>
