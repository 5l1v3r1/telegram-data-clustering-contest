      <h1>Perth men putting in marathon effort to Swim for Life</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T07:55:54+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 07:55</time> by <a rel="author">Laura Pond</a></address>
      <p>SIXTEEN swimmers are taking on a marathon relay to raise awareness of male mental health and suicide.</p>
      <p>The men, aged from 15 to 60, will swim laps at Scarborough Beach Pool on Sunday from 8am to 5pm raising money for the Black Dog Institute.</p>
      <p>Paul Litwin and friend Nik Zivanovic came up with the idea, calling it Swim for Life, and approached The Sandbar Scarborough Beach owner Ben Randall for sponsorship.</p>
      <p>The team grew and Mr Litwin said all participants had been affected by male suicide.</p>
      <p>“This cause is important to me as I have lost both a family member and friends to male suicide,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I wanted to make a difference and saw an opportunity through Swim for Life to do so.”</p>
      <p>The Booragoon resident said they chose swimming because it was an iconic Australian sport and suitable for a wide range of ages.</p>
      <p>“Swim For Life is an opportunity to raise awareness, celebrate inspiring males and honour those males that were lost to suicide,” he said.</p>
      <p>“The dream is to create a national day of awareness and remembrance on the final Sunday of November.”</p>
      <p>Mr Litwin said he also hoped to create awareness programs for students and adults.</p>
      <p>“We want people to support this worthy cause and help us to change the conversation for male mental health,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It is clear that this needs to happen in our society and now. Only together can we make this change happen.”</p>
