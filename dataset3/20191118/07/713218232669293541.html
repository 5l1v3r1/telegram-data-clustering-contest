      <h3>UPDATE</h3>
      <p>Gavin James Gardiner, the 51-year-old Ebor resident <a href="https://www.northerndailyleader.com.au/story/6495002/police-allege-ebor-man-lit-fire-to-protect-cannabis-crop/#slide=0">accused of deliberately torching bushland last week to protect a hidden cannabis crop</a>, will remain behind bars until at least next month, after fronting court again.</p>
      <p>Gavin James Gardiner appeared via video link in Armidale Local Court on Monday morning, but made no application for bail. It was formally refused by magistrate Michael Holmes.</p>
      <p>Gardiner did not enter pleas to charges of 'intentionally causing fire and being reckless as to its spread' nor for 'dishonestly for gain damaging property by fire'.</p>
      <p>Mr Holmes adjourned the case to early December, where it will be referred to the DPP to prosecute, ordering Gardiner be remanded in custody until then.</p>
      <p>Australian Community Media has been told firefighters worked to save Gardiner's house from the fire, which had engulfed more than 10,000 hectares by Sunday afternoon and continued to spread.</p>

      <p>As firefighters battled the blaze on Friday, locals were forced to evacuate their homes, or seek shelter as the fire bore down on the dry village.</p>

      <p>As of Sunday night, the fire had eased to 'Advice' level, reducing the immediate threat to properties.</p>
      <p>Residents are outraged at claims the fire - which was sparked in the Guyra Road area, about 10km west of the village on Thursday - was deliberately lit to stop a cannabis crop going up in flames; but also during a total fire ban, and one of the worst droughts on record.</p>
      <p><i>O</i>n Friday Gardiner was arrested by Armidale detectives at an Ebor hotel at about 2pm. He was refused bail by the registrar in an out-of-sessions bail hearing in Armidale Local Court on Saturday morning.</p>
      <p>He was ordered to remain in custody until Monday where he will reappear in Armidale court in front of magistrate Michael Holmes.</p>
      <p>Gardiner faces a maximum penalty of 21 years' imprisonment if found guilty of intentionally causing a fire and being reckless to its spread. He is yet to enter a plea.</p>

      <p>On Sunday afternoon, the Guyra Road, Ebor fire forced the closure of the Waterfall Way, with a Watch-and-Act fire warning in place.</p>
      <p>Strong winds fanned flames and sparked more activity on the fireground, which saw the blaze burning towards the Ebor village, in an easterly direction towards Waterfall Way.</p>
      <p>The winds - which played havoc with control efforts - were then expected to see the fire shift towards the Wongwibinda area.</p>
      <p>Residents were being warned to monitor conditions and remain vigilant as firefighters tried to control the blaze.</p>
      <p>As a result of the massive fire, Ebor Public School was closed on Monday because of safety concerns.</p>
