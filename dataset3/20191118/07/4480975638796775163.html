      <p>The safe-haven Japanese yen remained on the defensive at the start of a new trading week and lifted the USD/JPY pair back closer to the very important 200-day SMA, around the 109.00 handle.<br/> <br/>The pair added to Friday's goodish recovery move from near two-week lows and gained some follow-through traction during the Asian session on Monday. The incoming positive trade-related headlines continued denting demand for traditional safe-haven currencies, including the Japanese yen and turned out to be one of the key factors driving the pair higher.</p>
      <h3>Positive trade developments remain supportive</h3>
      <p>In the latest development, Chinese state media Xinhua said on Sunday the two countries had "constructive talks" on trade in a high-level phone call on Saturday. This comes on the back of last week's comments by US officials that they were close to securing a trade deal with China, which helped offset a subdued US Dollar demand and remained supportive of the pair's uptick.<br/> <br/>The USD bulls remained on the defensive in the wake of Friday's generally disappointing US manufacturing data, which largely negated slightly better-than-expected October monthly <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/economic-calendar">Retail Sales</a>. This coupled with a modest pullback in the US Treasury bond yields further weighed on the greenback and might keep a lid on any runaway rally for the major, at least for the time being.<br/> <br/>Moving ahead, there isn't any major market-moving economic data due for release on Monday. Hence, the incoming US-China trade headlines might continue to influence the USD price dynamics/broader market risk <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/sentiment">sentiment</a> and play a key role in producing some short-term trading opportunities.</p>
