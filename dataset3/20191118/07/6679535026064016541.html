      <p>The Delhi Cabinet on Monday passed a scheme to provide free sewer connections till March 31, 2020, in areas where sewer lines had been laid in the city, said Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, while addressing a press conference.</p>
      <p>Developmental, road cutting and connection charges will be waived off under the ‘Mukhyamantri Muft Sewer Yogana’.</p>
      <p>The Chief Minister also said that the odd-even vehicle rationing scheme would not be extended.</p>
      <p>Responding to the results of a study released by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) that the water in Delhi was the most unsafe among 21 State capitals, the Chief Minister said that of the 1.55 lakh samples tested by the Delhi government since January, 98.57% samples had passed.</p>
      <p>“I challenge, you (Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan) also test, we will also test, you also come along with us. I’ll invite Paswan<i>ji </i>to come along with us and take 1,500-2,000 samples,” Mr. Kejriwal said.</p>
      <p>He said that the Central government had taken only 11 samples for their study from Delhi and ideally 2,000 samples should have been taken.</p>
