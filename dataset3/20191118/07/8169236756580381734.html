        <b>Chelsea striker Michy Batshuayi has delivered what sounds like a pretty decisive statement on his future at Stamford Bridge.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Belgium international has had an up-and-down Chelsea career so far, initially looking very promising when he first joined the Blues before falling down the pecking order.</p>
      <h3>MORE: <a href="https://www.caughtoffside.com/2019/11/17/chelsea-enter-race-with-pl-rivals-to-sign-highly-rated-english-attacker/">Chelsea enter race with PL rivals to sign highly-rated English attacker</a></h3>
      <p>This has led to Batshuayi going out on loan several times with spells at Borussia Dortmund, Valencia and Crystal Palace.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/exclusive-palace-to-offer-shunned-chelsea-star-january-lifeline">Team Talk</a> recently also linked Batshuayi as a target for Palace in a permanent transfer deal, though it now sounds as though the 26-year-old is not looking for a move away from west London.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Belgian radio station RTBF, as translated by <a href="https://www.football.london/chelsea-fc/transfer-news/michy-batshuayi-chelsea-transfer-news-17269869">football.london</a>, Batshuayi sounded very positive about remaining with CFC, expressing his love for the club.</p>
      <p>“I have never been a full-fledged starter, but Chelsea is my club, that’s where I feel at home,” he said.</p>
      <p>“It’s a club I love deeply!”</p>
      <p>Chelsea fans will probably be aware by now that Batshuayi is unlikely to ever become a world class performer for them, but there’s no doubt he has value as an option off the bench.</p>
      <p>On top of that, he’s become something of a fan-favourite for his bubbly personality on Twitter and seems like the kind of character that’s good to have around in the dressing room.</p>
