      <p>Chief Minister <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/arvind-kejriwal">Arvind Kejriwal </a>on Monday said there is no need of the odd-even road rationing scheme now as the pollution levels have come down.</p>
      <p>The Delhi government brought the scheme into effect from November 4 as the city's <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/air-quality">air quality </a>plunged into the "severe" category.</p>
      <p>The scheme concluded on November 15 with Kejriwal saying it could be extended if required. He had said that a final decision on extension will be taken on Monday.</p>
      <p>"The sky is clear now, there is no need of it (scheme)", he said in a press conference.</p>
      <p>Over 5,000 violators of the rule were fined with Rs 4,000 each during the scheme.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/air-quality">air quality </a>in Delhi improved marginally on Monday but remained in the "poor" category for the second consecutive day.</p>
      <p>At 9 am on Monday, the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/topic/air-quality">air quality </a>index (AQI) in the <a href="https://www.business-standard.com/category/current-affairs-news-national-1150106.htm">national </a>capital stood at 207 against an AQI of 254 at the same time on Sunday.</p>
