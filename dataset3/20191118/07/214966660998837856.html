      <h1>Oddest calls from Aussies abroad revealed </h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T07:16:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 07:16</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://www.mygc.com.au/author/aap/" target="_blank">AAP</a></address>
      <p>From a bird blamed for eating a passport to someone seeking advice on the egg preferences of North Koreans, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has heard it all.</p>
      <p>Those examples are a few of the unusual requests for help from Australians travelling overseas, as revealed by Foreign Minister Marise Payne on Monday when she launched the annual State of Play report.</p>
      <p>The report details where Australian citizens travel and the assistance they sometimes require.</p>
      <p>A panicked Aussie eager to jet off to Bali called for consular help when an airline wouldn’t let them fly because they claimed a bird had eaten their ID.</p>
      <p>“What could possibly go wrong on that Bali trip?” Ms Payne quipped in Sydney on Monday.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, in Puerto Rico, an Australian who wanted to change hotels decided to ring the department to see if they could help them in their endeavour by ordering an Uber.</p>
      <p>Another called to ask for diplomatic immunity – despite still living in Australia.</p>
      <p>But “perhaps the strangest” of all requests received in the 2018/19 financial year was from a person keen to sell eggs in Pyongyang.</p>
      <p>“Ok, I thought,” Ms Payne said.</p>
      <p>“Except that the second question was ‘Could DFAT please ascertain whether North Koreans prefer white or brown eggs?'”. The answer remains unclear.</p>
