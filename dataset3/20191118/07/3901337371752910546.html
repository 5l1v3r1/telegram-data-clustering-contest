      <p>After being substituted twice in consecutive games for Juventus and seemingly falling out with Maurizio Sarri before the international break, superstar Cristiano Ronaldo has now broken his silence on the matter.</p>

      </p>
      <p>Despite Sarri's claims that the Portuguese forward was struggling with an injury in the Bianconeri's past two matches, <a href="https://www.soccerladuma.co.za/news/articles/international/categories/messi-ronaldo-neymar-watch-1/cristiano-ronaldo-hailed-after-hat-trick-performance/667501">Ronaldo scored a hat-trick</a> in his country's 6-0 win over Lithuania last week and another in their 2-0 victory over Luxembourg this past Sunday.</p>
      <p>The former Real Madrid forward caused a stir last week when he reacted angrily to being taken off by his manager on two different occasions. Against Lokomotiv Moscow in the UEFA Champions League, he seemed to exchange heated words with the Italian tactician, while he headed straight down the tunnel when he was substituted against AC Milan, and even reportedly left the stadium early.</p>

      </p>
      <p>However, Ronaldo's form for Portugal, especially in their first 2020 European Championship qualifier of the international break, appeared to suggest he was at his physical best, but after his single strike on Sunday, he admitted he has been carrying a knock, and that Sarri was simply trying to protect him.</p>
      <p>"It is true that I have been limited in the past few weeks," he said, according to <i>Calciomercato.</i></p>
      <p>"I tried to help Juve by playing injured. I don't like to be subbed off, but there aren't any issues.</p>
      <p>"I wasn't 100% so it's normal that Sarri wanted to protect me."</p>

      </p>
      <p>Ronaldo has now scored 99 goals for his country, and is just 10 strikes away from equalling the all-time international record of 109 goals held by Iran's Ali Daei.</p>
