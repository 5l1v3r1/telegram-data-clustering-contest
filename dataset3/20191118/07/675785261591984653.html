      <h2>Cherelle Farrguia, from Fairwater, Cardiff, developed aquagenic urticaria and found her body covered in painful rashes which she compared to "stinging nettles"</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T07:59:40+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 07:59</time> by <a rel="author">Anna Lewis</a></address>
      <p>A mum became <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/allergies">allergic</a> to water following the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/giving-birth">birth</a> of her daughter.</p>
      <p>Cherelle Farrguia, 27, developed aquagenic urticaria, a rare condition which causes the body to break out in painful hives.</p>
      <p>The mum had experienced rashes which she compared to "stinging nettles," <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/allergic-to-water-pregnant-hormones-17271454">Wales Online</a> reports.</p>
      <p>But after becoming <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/pregnancy">pregnant</a> again, Cherelle has seen her condition reversed.</p>
      <p>Cherelle, who lives in Fairwater, Cardiff, said: "It was honestly the most bizarre thing. When I was diagnosed I joined a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> group and there were a couple of women who said it had gone away when they became pregnant but some said it had got a lot worse.</p>
      <p>"I knew I was taking a massive risk but I knew I wanted another baby. As soon as I found out I was pregnant it actually went away straight away. I had a shower and realised I wasn't itching."</p>

      <p>Cherelle, who is expecting a baby boy in February, said it originally took doctors around six months to diagnose the condition.</p>
      <p>It meant she had been unable to go out during heavy rain or take a bath - but was not affected by drinking water.</p>
      <p>Cherelle, who is studying to become a mental health counsellor, added: "I was going to the GP and they were all looking at me like I was bonkers and telling me to turn the water temperature down.</p>

      <h3>What is aquagenic urticaria?</h3>
      <p>Aquagenic urticaria is a rare condition in which hives develop after the skin comes in contact with water.</p>
      <p>The exact cause of is currently unknown.</p>
      <p>It is extremely rare and there is little known about treatments.</p>
      <p>There is not thought to be a cure.</p>
      <p>   </p>
      <p>"It took about five or six months until I saw an allergist and they took one look and told me it was aquagenic urticaria. I knew all the research I had done was right because that was the only explanation.</p>
      <p>"At the start it was really, really difficult. It was really upsetting thinking 'how am I going to live with it?' I was thinking about going on holiday and I was just thinking about how I wouldn't be able to go in the pool, or swim in the ocean.</p>
      <p>"When it's been raining outside I've always been cautious, especially since one doctor told me I could go into anaphylactic shock.</p>
      <p>"At the beginning I was really nervous about taking a shower without anyone else being in the house, especially if it was just me and my daughter. I would just think if something happened to me she would be on her own in the house."</p>

      <p>As time went on, Cherelle said she began to adapt to her new lifestyle after her diagnosis and learn what her body could handle.</p>
      <p>She has also overcome postnatal depression with the help of family and mental health professionals, and is "confident" looking to the future.</p>
      <p>But she is unsure whether her condition will return after giving birth for a second time.</p>
      <p>She said: "I couldn't believe it, I went from having two-minute showers to 20-minute baths. Before I had Willow I would have baths every day as for me it was a massive way of helping with my anxiety.  Everyone would buy me bath bombs for Christmas and my birthday as they knew how much I loved it. I haven't gone swimming yet but to know I have that option is really nice."</p>
      <p>She continued: "I'm trying to not get my hopes up too much. Some women have said it has stayed that way, some women it was just for their pregnancy. It does get me down to know it could come back but I got used to it the first time, I can adjust again."</p>
