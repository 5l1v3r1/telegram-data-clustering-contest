      <p>Piers Morgan tore into <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-andrew-duke-of-york/">Prince Andrew</a> on Good Morning Britain for telling ‘demonstrable lies’ during his BBC interview with Emily Maitlis.</p>
      <p>The infamous presenter and co-host Susanna Reid were joined by Andrew Pierce, Kevin McGuire, royal editor Chris Ship and Loose Women’s Jane Moore to discuss the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/prince-andrew-defends-car-crash-interview-saying-spoke-honesty-humility-11173141/">Duke Of York’s ‘car crash interview’</a> about his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, which he described as ‘undeniably damaging to the monarchy’.</p>
      <p>‘Andrew throughout that interview was telling demonstrable lies,’ Piers told the panel. ‘He said he never sweats, right? Loads of pictures suddenly burst on the internet of him sweating.</p>

      <p>‘He only wears a jacket and tie when he’s out on a social thing, there are loads of pictures of him in open-neck shirts, etcetera, etcetera. All these little things, which he stated as fact…’</p>
      <p>‘You and I know, that if you say these things, journalists are going to go out and knock it all down like skittles,’ Jane replied. ‘For me, it showed he was very arrogant, he’s very entitled, he’s been in a bubble his whole life.’</p>

      <p>Piers continued: ‘I can’t see a major charity, wanting right now, to associate themselves with him. ‘If he was a major celebrity he would be toast. If he was a politician he’d have to resign.</p>
      <p>‘The only thing he can resign from in public life is his role as a functioning, working prince.</p>
      <p>‘I think he’s perilously close to actually having to be suspended.’</p>

      <p>Over the last year, Piers has slammed Meghan Markle and Prince Harry for a number of things, most recently <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/12/piers-morgan-bashes-meghan-markle-playing-victim-card-attention-11081740/">Meghan for ‘playing the victim card for attention’</a>, but has now admitted that their goings-on have fallen to the wayside.</p>

      <p>‘We’ve had a lot of stuff in the last year about Meghan and Harry, for better or for worse a lot of incidents, controversies,’ Piers stated.</p>
      <p>‘All of the stuff they’ve been up to pales into insignificance compared to the gravity of this.</p>
      <p>‘This is an allegation that Prince Andrew attached himself after someone was convicted of paedophilia to that person in a way that he described as unbecoming, but most people would believe was effectively tolerating a paedeophile.’</p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/prince-andrew-defends-car-crash-interview-saying-spoke-honesty-humility-11173141/">Prince Andrew stands by his decision to be interviewed</a> about his involvement with convicted sex offender Epstein, and spoke with ‘honesty and humility’, sources have told the BBC.</p>
