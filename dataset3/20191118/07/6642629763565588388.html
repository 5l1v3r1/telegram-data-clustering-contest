      <p><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/japan.html">Japan</a>'s SoftBank Corp plans to merge its internet unit Yahoo Japan with messaging app operator Line Corp to create a $30bn tech giant, as it bags struggling internet companies to bulk up against rivals like Rakuten Inc.</p>
      <p>Softbank said in a <a href="https://group.softbank/en/corp/set/data/news/press/sb/2019/20191118_01/pdf/20191118_01.pdf">statement</a> that Yahoo Japan, which last month changed its name to Z Holdings Corp, will merge with Line, owned by <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/topics/country/south-korea.html">South Korea</a>'s Naver Corp, in a deal to be completed in October 2020.</p>

      <p>The companies aim for a definitive agreement by next month in a transaction that will see SoftBank Corp and Naver form an equally split joint venture partnership that will control Z Holdings, which will, in turn, operate Yahoo Japan and Line.</p>
      <p>SoftBank Corp, which owns roughly 44 percent of Z Holidngs, and Naver, which owns 73 percent of loss-making Line, plan to launch a tender offer for Line's remaining shares at a total of about 170 billion yen ($1.56bn) - a 13.4 percent premium to the shares' price before news of the merger broke.</p>
      <p>Line's shares were up 2.6 percent at 5,180 yen ($46.50) in early Tokyo trade on Monday.</p>
      <p>Line has been looking for growth through expansion into areas such as QR code payments with Line Pay, but has been squeezed because of its limited funds and heavy-spending peers including SoftBank, which has a rival service called PayPay.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Yahoo Japan, which counts some 48 million daily active users across a portfolio of more than 100 mobile phone apps, has been struggling to keep its position as the country's leading e-commerce player and web portal with the rise of rivals like Amazon and Rakuten Inc.</p>
      <p>The merger deal is the latest example of consolidation in Japan's technology industry. SoftBank this month completed its acquisition of online fashion retailer Zozo Inc, whose founder and ex-Chief Executive Yusaku Maezawa sold down his stake following a series of missteps.</p>
      <p>Coming at a time of <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/11/south-korean-court-begins-trial-japan-wartime-sex-slavery-191113165554865.html">heightened political tension</a> between Japan and South Korea, the merger might be the two countries' most significant economic cooperation of the last 10 years, Jaewoong Lee, a South Korean serial entrepreneur and founder of Naver rival Daum wrote on his Facebook page late on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Z Holdings will continue to be a consolidated subsidiary of SoftBank Corp, which is a unit of investment conglomerate SoftBank Group Corp.</p>
