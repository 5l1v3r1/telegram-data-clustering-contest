      <p>Police in <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_location=California">California</a> say several people have died and at least nine people were shot at a party in Fresno in what appears to be a “mass casualty shooting”.</p>
      <p>Fresno police Lt Bill Dooley said the shooting took place about 6pm on Sunday (2am Monday, Irish time) on the city’s south-east side.</p>
      <p>Mr Dooley said there was a party in the back garden of a home to watch a football game when the shooting suspects sneaked in and fired into the crowd.</p>
      <p>Mr Dooley told the Fresno Bee and the KSEE/KGPE TV stations that at least nine people were shot, with several people being found dead in the backyard.</p>
      <p>There is not yet an exact number on the people who died.</p>
      <p>The TV stations reported that others were taken to <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Community+Regional+Medical+Centre">Community Regional Medical Centre</a> in critical condition, and some are in critical but stable condition.</p>
      <p>No suspect is in custody.</p>
