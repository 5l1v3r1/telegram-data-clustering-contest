        <b>NATHAN YOUNG-COOMBES revealed an inspirational pep talk from Peter Lovenkrands inspired him to a first Ibrox goal.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The 16-year-old hit the winner as <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14923/rangers/">Rangers</a> Colts beat Wrexham to book their place in the semi-final.</p>

      <p>Jamie Barjonas was also on target as Greame Murty’s kids saw off the National League outfit in front of a 5000 crowd.</p>
      <p>Young-Coombes came off the bench to put the seal on a terrific afternoon for the Gers kids, slamming home a rebound after the keeper spilled a Barjonas effort.</p>
      <p>It was the scenario the teenager had been working on for the previous 48 hours with former Gers favourite Lovenkrands, who is now part of the academy coaching staff.</p>
      <p>He said: “Peter and I had been going over his goals for Rangers, Newcastle and Birmingham on Thursday and Friday.</p>

      <p>“We were honing in on how to get into the six yard box, being alive and picking up scraps because that’s where you get joy.</p>
      <p>“I was lucky enough to pick up on what we were speaking about at half-time — getting in that box and get that goal.</p>
      <p>"I had noticed when I was on the bench that the keeper spilled one and I was hoping to get on and be alive to that.</p>
      <p>“Peter was telling me, any shots at the goalie, make sure I was following in. And I was lucky enough to get my goal today.”</p>
      <p>Young-Coombes joined Rangers from Chelsea earlier this year as he felt there was more opportunity to fast-track his career.</p>
      <p>The likeable youngster believes he made the right decision and is confident he will continue to make rapid progress under Lovenkrands and Murty.</p>
      <p>He said: “I came up here to eventually get first team football. All I can do is score. The managers are very good.</p>
      <p>“They know where I am in my development. I am only 16, so getting U21 football against a first team like Wrexham, you’d think: ‘wow, hold on a second’.</p>

      <p>"I have faith in what our coaches will do for me in the future.</p>
      <p>“Peter and Murts have been great for me. We are always talking about how I can take my game to the next level.</p>
      <p>“We were playing against a first team here and I’m only 16, so realistically I’m not going to bully them or outpace them.</p>
      <p>“Don’t get me wrong, I’m very confident in my own ability, but it’s about how I can beat a defender who is bigger than me, stronger than me.</p>
      <p>"I can do it by being alive in the box and that’s what happened.”</p>
      <p>Rangers joined <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14922/partick-thistle/">Partick Thistle</a>, <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14920/inverness/">Inverness</a> and Raith in the hat for the draw and are the first colts side to reach the last four.</p>
      <p>Given the feel-good factor swirling around the club at the moment Young-Coombes sees no reason why they cannot go all the way.</p>
      <p>He said: “Can we win it? Yes, we think so. There’s a real aura about the boys, from our Youth Champions League nights to playing in this tournament.</p>
      <p>“Everyone’s buzzing and it pushes our training sessions on because everyone wants to start and they are disappointed when they don’t start.</p>
      <p>“So when you do get on the park you want to prove you deserve to be in the starting 11.</p>
      <p>“It was a good victory. You could see what their game plan was from the outset, to try to catch us on the counter.</p>
      <p>“They were very frustrating and we needed to move the ball quickly, side to side, and look for little gaps which we could exploit.”</p>
      <p>Due to the international break Rangers allowed their Under-21 side to strut their stuff at Ibrox and they made the most of the unexpected opportunity.</p>
      <p>And Young-Coombes added: “The atmosphere was everything I hoped it would be.</p>
      <p>“I have been watching games from the stands, hoping to be on the pitch and it was a tremendous honour. Allowing us to play at Ibrox was great and we always want to play at Ibrox.</p>
      <p>“That’s why we play football, to play on the big occasions with big crowds and big atmosphere. That’s every little boy’s dream, to play in games like that.”</p>
