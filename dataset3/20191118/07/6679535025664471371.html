      <p>The Goods and Services Tax (GST) collection has almost stabilised and is being fine-tuned as per the emerging economic situation, Raj Kumar Barthwal, Member (Customs), Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC), said on Monday.</p>
      <p>“GST is a one-of-its-kind of transformational tax regime that has happened in the world. It’s been on a zig-zag course and it has almost stabilised. And it’s been fine-tuned as the economic situation demanded,” he told reporters on the sidelines of a three-day conference organised by CBIC at Poornankuppam near here.</p>
      <p>Senior customs officials from 33 countries, including China, Australia, Japan, Iran and Cambodia are participating in the programme.</p>
