      <h2>SAM QUEK COLUMN: Quek knows first hand how off-field relationships don't stop success after she fell out with fellow Olympian Maddie Hinch</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T07:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Quek</a></address>
      <p>There’s only one clash everyone has been talking about in the last week. No, not KSI and Logan Paul’s boxing match...it has all been about Raheem Sterling versus Joe Gomez.</p>
      <p>The pair clashed during the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> ’s huge win over <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> in the Premier League and then it spilled over when the pair met up for international duty with England.</p>
      <p>Sterling reportedly confronted Gomez aggressively again which prompted the England manager Gareth Southgate to initially kick Sterling out the squad and then leave him out of the match against Montenegro.</p>
      <p>It’s fair to say all hell has broken loose since in the media with everyone piling in on whether it was the right or wrong way to deal with the situation.</p>

      <p>I feel I’m in a good place to comment on this.</p>
      <p>It is no secret that in the build-up and during the 2016 Olympic Games, the relationship between me and our goalkeeper Maddie Hinch was pretty poor.</p>
      <p>Off the field, there was an undeniable tension between us, to the point that we weren’t on speaking terms.</p>
      <p>On the field, I was a defender, as positionally close to Maddie as you could get. So you would think this could have been a major issue, but neither of us ever allowed our off-field relationship to affect our on-field performance, whether at training or in a match.</p>

      <p>The myth that everyone has to get on brilliantly in a high-performance team is absolute nonsense.</p>
      <p>We won gold!</p>
      <p>There just has to be mutual respect.</p>
      <p>I have been a big fan of Southgate as England manager and he got this 90 per cent correct.</p>
      <p>Players have tensions between them all the time and a wayward tackle in practice is not unusual but Sterling didn’t need to bring that level of open disrespect into the England camp on another player. That is where mutual respect has been lost.</p>
      <p>Sterling felt it was fine to show Gomez little respect in front of his international teammates in bringing something from outside the squad in this manner. That is not fine.</p>

      <p>Southgate had to act on it but initially kicking Sterling out the squad was wrong.</p>
      <p>Rio Ferdinand made the point that Sterling is still young and, instead, educate him how to deal with things better.</p>
      <p>That’s right.</p>
      <p>Kicking him out made it public and brought a level of humiliation to it.</p>
      <p>That wasn’t necessary and was illustrated by the fact that Gomez was then booed in the match at Wembley as fans felt sorry for Sterling.</p>
      <p>As much as Maddie and I had a difficult relationship, we showed each other mutual respect always and that led to us playing well together. Sterling crossed a line and needed to be pulled up on that and, importantly, he shouldn’t do that ever again.</p>
      <p>Dislike teammates, not ideal but fine.</p>
      <p>However, always respect them for their ability on the field to help the team that you are part of and desperately want to win.</p>
