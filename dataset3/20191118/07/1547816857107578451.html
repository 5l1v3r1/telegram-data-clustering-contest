        <b>The trailer of Kareena Kapoor Khan, Akshay Kumar, Kiara Advani and Diljit Dosanjh's upcoming film Good Newwz is out now and it promises to give you many hysterical fits</b>
      </p>
      <p>Good Newwz is going to get delivered at the wrong address this time. Well, that's what the trailer of Kareena Kapoor Khan, Akshay Kumar, Kiara Advani and Diljit Dosanjh's upcoming film Good Newwz says! The posters of this film had given us a hint that the film will revolve around two couples who are looking forward to become parents. But who knew that there will be such a twist that sperms of the men will be get hatched in another woman's womb.</p>
      <p>Confused? Fret not, we are here to help.</p>
      <p>The trailer of Good Newwz kind off gives away the plot of the story completely. Kareena and Akshay are an Elite city-based couple while Kiara and Diljit are a proper Punjabi couple. Both the pairs opt for IVF to have kids but coincidentally, both of them have the same surname - Batras. And that's where the blunder takes place. At the hospital, the staff gets confused and then there is an adla-badli of sperms. Kiara's eggs are injected with Akshay's sperms while Diljit's little one find a bun in Kareena. Since they do not opt for abortion, their lives get intertwined in various forms.</p>
      <p>The trailer has many moments that leave us in splits. Especially the one that has Akshay saying that entering the bedroom is like going for a surgical strike. Akshay Kumar has always been too good with comedy and sarcasm, and this time too, he has managed to make us laugh. Diljit and his English is too good! Sperm becomes Spam and we are rolling on the floor laughing hard. The chemistry of both the couples is perfect and it appears that we shall get our dose of entertainment in the form of Good Newwz. In bits, we see the glimpses of a peppy dance number featuring all four of them. Watch the trailer below:</p>
