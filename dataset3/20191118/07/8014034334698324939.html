      <p>AUCKLAND, New Zealand — Former Washington Wizards guard Glen Rice Jnr will appear in an Auckland court Wednesday to face charges stemming from his arrest days after joining the New Zealand Breakers in the Australian National Basketball League.</p>
      <p>The New Zealand Breakers have placed Rice on indefinite suspension following his arrest Thursday after an altercation outside an Auckland bar.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old son of three-time NBA all star Glen Rice is also being investigated by Basketball Australia’s integrity unit.</p>
      <p>Breakers owner Matt Walsh said Rice’s suspension became necessary after new information was received about the alleged incident which occurred early Thursday morning.</p>
      <p>“I respect our legal process in New Zealand and firmly believe that you are innocent until proven guilty,” Walsh said.</p>
      <p>“However, regardless of the outcome of Glen’s court appearance, there is no denying he has let down the club, our fans and the New Zealand public after we gave him this lifeline.</p>
      <p>“I put structures in place, which I thought would prevent any problems happening, but I was wrong.”</p>
      <p>Walsh said Rice had accepted his offer of professional medical help and had already begun a course of treatment.</p>
      <p>“Glen is a tremendously talented basketballer but I expect our players to be professional both on and off the court,” he said. “I feel it is my duty to assist Glen in paying his accommodation, legal and medical costs while he remains in our country to settle his business.</p>
      <p>“But I also have no option but to remove him from the team.”</p>
      <p>The ANBL previously ordered Rice to be stood down from the Breakers’ scheduled match Sunday against the Wildcats in Perth.</p>
      <p>Rice joined the Breakers as an injury replacement for fellow American Brian “Scotty” Hopson. He brought with him a history of off-court incidents.</p>
      <p>Rice attended Georgia Tech but was dismissed by coach Brian Gregory in 2012 after multiple suspensions, the last involving a shooting outside an Atlanta nightclub.</p>
      <p>He was taken by the Philadelphia 76ers as the 35th pick in the 2013 draft but later traded to Washington. He was waived by the Wizards in January 2015.</p>
