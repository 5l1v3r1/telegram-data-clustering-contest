      <h1>Sena targets BJP over ‘paltry’ aid announced by Governor for rain-hit farmers</h1>
      <h2>Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari had granted relief of ₹8,000 per hectare up to two hectares for agricultural Kharif crops and ₹18,000 per hectare up to two hectares for horticulture/perennial crops</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T07:54:16+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 07:54</time> by <a rel="author">PTI</a></address>
      <p>The Shiv Sena on Monday took a swipe at its one-time ally, the BJP, over the “paltry” financial assistance announced by Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari to the farmers affected by unseasonal rains.</p>
      <p>Mr. Koshyari had on Saturday granted relief of ₹8,000 per hectare up to two hectares for agricultural Kharif crops and ₹18,000 per hectare up to two hectares for horticulture/perennial crops.</p>
      <p>In an editorial in the party mouthpiece “Saamana”, the Sena said the BJP, which is in power at the Centre, left the affected farmers in the state “disappointed” with the “meagre” relief.</p>
      <p>“Farmers in Maharashtra were expecting the governor would announce a major relief package for them. But the ₹8,000 per hectare aid for kharif crops and ₹12,000 for horticulture plantation is very less,” the editorial said.</p>
      <p>The Sena has demanded a compensation of ₹25,000 per hectare for the Kharif (summer) crops destroyed due to the double whammy of the unseasonal rains and delayed retreat of south-west monsoon in October.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, the NCP and the Congress with whom the Sena is trying to form a coalition government in the state, had termed the assistance “meagre” too and demanded it be raised to at least ₹25,000 crore.</p>
      <p>Maharashtra has been under President’s Rule since November 12, as no political party could form a government in the wake of a fractured mandate in the assembly polls that failed to elect a clear winner.</p>
      <p>“State BJP president Chandrakant Patil admitted that the announced amount was very low, but does it (the BJP) have courage to condemn the same and stand behind farmers? There is a difference between what BJP leaders are saying and their actual action,” it said.</p>
      <p>Farmers in Marathwada and North Maharashtra regions were worst affected by the unseasonal rains.</p>
      <p>“The State is under Central Rule at present. Farmers from more than 350 tehsils were expecting some concrete measures from the governor and the Union government like allocation of a revised financial support, but they were left disappointed,” the Sena said.</p>
      <p>The Uddhav Thackeray-led party further said that crops over approximately 94 lakh hectares were damaged, affecting more than one crore people directly dependent on agriculture.</p>
      <p>“If crop insurance companies refuse to assess the damage then it would further worsen the situation of farmers because they would not be able to get any compensation,” Sena said.</p>
      <p>The saffron party has been aggressively demanding that insurance companies expedite the process to pay compensation to the rain-hit farmers.</p>
      <p>“Untimely rains also affected fishermen who need to be compensated accordingly,” the Sena demanded.</p>
      <p>The then Chief Minister, Devendra Fadnavis, had on November 2 approved ₹10,000 crore as a special assistance for affected farmers.</p>
      <p>The Sena feared a cascading effect on sowing of Rabi (winter) crops if the farmers are not paid adequate compensation immediately.</p>
      <p>Measures like a complete loan waiver for farmers were reportedly discussed ahead of finalising the draft Common Minimum Programme (CMP) for the Shiv Sena, the Congress and the NCP.</p>
      <p>NCP supremo Sharad Pawar had last week visited the affected farmers in Vidarbha region in east Maharashtra.</p>
