      <h1>Bangkok girl kills herself after allegedly held captive, raped by boy gang</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T07:04:31+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 07:04</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Bangkok" target="_blank">Coconuts Bangkok</a></address>
      <p>A court approved arrest warrants this morning for two men accused of raping and confining a teen girl who went on to kill herself Friday due to what her family says was emotional distress brought on by the abuse.</p>
      <p>One of at least two suspects in the assault of the 13-year-old girl in Bangkok’s Khlong Toei district had already been apprehended on a weapons charge while police are searching today for the other, a police spokesman told <i>Coconuts Bangkok</i>, following her suicide three days ago.</p>
      <p>“When we raided the first suspect’s home, we found weapons in his house, so we detained him and charged him with illegally possessing firearms. He is currently locked up. Meanwhile, the court just approved the warrant for the second suspect this morning,” Krissana Pattanacharoen said.</p>
      <p>“Both suspects face charges for collaborating to sexually abuse the girl,” he added.</p>
      <p>The case came to wider public attention when the girl, identified only by her nickname Pinkie, jumped to her death from her Suan Luang-district apartment building Friday, just before midnight. Before her death, Pinkie reportedly got into a heated argument with her mother and ran to the roof and jumped.</p>
      <p>Several media outlets have published a photo reportedly taken by Pinkie of her legs dangling from the roof and sent to friend just before she died. “I’m about to go, I love you,” her message said.</p>
      <p>She also posted a series of messages on Facebook suggesting that she believed she was pregnant, including “I’m about to go” and “If I wasn’t pregnant, I would have gone a long time ago.”</p>
      <p>On Saturday, her 45-year-old mother filed a report with police in Khlong Tan police accusing a gang of men of imprisoning and raping her daughter on Nov. 11, the night of Loy Krathong, in Khlong Toei’s Khlong Tan area. Some reports place the number involved at upward of six men.</p>
      <p>Her mother said the attack sent her daughter into a deep depression. It was during a raid of the first suspect’s apartment that the police found the unregistered firearm, leading to his arrest.</p>
      <p>Pinkie’s mother told police that her daughter was locked up in a Khlong Tan district apartment and assaulted for some time last week. Krissana, of the Royal Thai Police, would not detail how long Pinkie was detained by the suspects but said she likely first met them on the night of the incident. </p>
      <p>“There were two girls, two boys on the night of the incident. One of the girls, Pinkie, is dead. Warrants have been issued for both boys,” he said, adding that the remaining girl remains a person of interest while the matter is thoroughly investigated.</p>
      <p>Krissana said more details would be released as the investigation continues.</p>
