      <p><b>Olufemi Atoyebi </b>and<b> Success Nwogu</b></p>
      <p>The Independent National Electoral Commission on Sunday declared as inconclusive the rerun of election in Kogi West Senatorial District held on Saturday because the margin of win was less than the total cancelled votes.</p>
      <p>It said that it would later announce a date for supplementary election in the area.</p>
      <p>INEC said the candidate of the All Progressives Congress, Senator Smart Adeyemi, scored a total of 80,118 votes while the Peoples Democratic Party Senatorial candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, Senator Dino Melaye, scored 59,548 votes.</p>
      <p>According to the returning officer, Prof. Olayinde Lawal, the margin between the candidate of the APC Melaye is 20,570.</p>
      <p>Lawal explained that the total margin between both candidates was lower than the 43,127 registered voters in 53 polling units of 20 registration areas in the zone where elections were canceled.</p>
      <p>The returning officer, who declared the election inconclusive said he decided not to declare a winner because of the slim margin between the two leading candidates.</p>
