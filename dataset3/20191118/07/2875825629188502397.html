      <h1>I'm A Celeb viewers spot Dec Donnelly get very distracted by glam female rangers</h1>
      <h2>Declan Donnelly had viewers in hysterics as his head was turned during the launch of 'm A Celebrity: Extra Camp</h2>

      <p>Declan Donnelly had I'm A Celebrity viewers in hysterics on Sunday night as they spotted his hilarious reaction to two female rangers who had popped briefly into the studio.</p>
      <p>It came as Dec and his co-presenter Ant McPartlin appeared on spin off show Extra Camp after wrapping up the main launch show.</p>
      <p>The team were playing a game to celebrate Ant's birthday and two glamorous female rangers walked on set to deliver props.</p>
      <p>The IAC crew are usually men and the Geordie duo noticed the difference straight away.</p>

      <p>"They are not the normal rangers!" cried Ant, before waving after them.</p>
      <p>Dec, however, jumped out of his seat and asked: "Where did you get those rangers?" before a laughing <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/who-ryan-thomas-celebrity-big-13078203">Ryan Thomas</a> had to pull him back down.</p>
      <p>Eagle eyed viewers at home immediately clocked the blunder.</p>
      <p>"If my future husband doesn’t react to me the way dec reacted to the new rangers what’s the point <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ImACeleb?src=hashtag_click">#ImACeleb</a> " said one.</p>
      <p>"Dec eyeing up the rangers, actually can’t cope," laughed a third.</p>
      <p>"I don't know what’s funnier <a href="https://twitter.com/antanddec">@antanddec</a> ’s (especially Dec’s) reaction to the pretty rangers on extra camp or <a href="https://twitter.com/adamthomas21">@adamthomas21</a> laughing his a*** off about it," added a fourth</p>

      <p>The presenters were in great spirits after an action-packed opener to the 2019 series of I'm A Celeb.</p>
      <p>The launch saw the celebs plank walking, sky-diving and facing bugs within hours of the show starting.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow night looks set to be just as thrilling with Caitlyn Jenner and Kate Garraway faced to take on the first Bushtucker Trial.</p>

      <p>Caitlyn, who is taking home the largest fee this year, impressed viewers with her courageous attitude and support of her fellow campmates.</p>
      <p>The US star was unphased at the prospect of jumping out of a helicopter and was the only one not to jump out of a jeep screaming when the celebs realised they'd been joined by a huge spider.</p>
      <p>
