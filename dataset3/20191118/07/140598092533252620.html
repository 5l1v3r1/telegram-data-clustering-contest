      <h3>Queen did not give blessing to 'excruciating' BBC interview</h3>
      <p>Excruciating… extraordinary… a car crash. The fallout from the <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/royal-family/2019/11/18/prince-andrew-interview-jeffrey-epstein-bbc/">Prince Andrew's Newsnight interview </a>about his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein is intensifying after it was revealed <a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=hd328e60,32f263f2,32f263fe">the Queen did not give her approval</a>. Palace insiders have accused Prince Andrew's private office of "operating in a silo" as it emerged Her Majesty was only made aware of the primetime interrogation after it had been set up. Rather than ending speculation about the Duke's behaviour, the programme revived the controversy and <a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=hd328e60,32f263f2,32f263ff">generated fresh questions</a> about his movements. One former courtier described the interview as "excruciating". The Prince of Wales is being urged to consider <a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=hd328e60,32f263f2,32f26400">downgrading the Duke's status</a> as a working royal when he becomes king. And ex-royal spokesman Dickie Arbiter said the interview was a <a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=hd328e60,32f263f2,32f26401">"daft idea for an arrogant, not very bright, man"</a>.</p>
      <p>Serious concerns are being raised at the Palace about why the Duke was exposed to a no-holds-barred interview. It left him having to answer repeated questions about whether he had ever had sex with Virginia Roberts Giuffre, an Epstein sex slave. The prince's various "alibis" - one involving his "inability" to sweat and another a dinner at Pizza Express in Woking - are facing intense scrutiny. We examine and test the <a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=hd328e60,32f263f2,32f26402">key claims made by the Duke</a>.</p>
      <h3>PM promises tax cut as he tries to get business back on side</h3>
      <p>Boris Johnson will promise to cut employers' National Insurance contributions and three other taxes on companies as he lays out the Tories' credentials as the party of business. The Prime Minister will make a major election pledge to reduce business rates and taxes holding firms back. <b>Gordon Rayner</b> explains <a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=hd328e60,32f263f2,32f26403">how Mr Johnson will try to heal the rift</a> between the Government and the corporate world over Brexit. Meanwhile, a <a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=hd328e60,32f263f2,32f26404">flagship Labour policy is in tatters</a>after the party caved in to union barons over an environmental pledge. But our <a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=hd328e60,32f263f2,32f26405">polls tracker</a> shows that history tells us not to write off Jeremy Corbyn just yet.</p>
      <h3>CBeebies rocks boat by teaching that Gibraltar is Spanish</h3>
      <p>The BBC has been accused of rewriting history in a CBeebies programme that appears to teach children that Gibraltar is part of Spain. In the episode of <i>Go Jetters</i>, animated explorers learn about the migration route of birds from the Rock. But one of the characters says they are flying from "Spain to Africa", with no explanation of Gibraltar being a British overseas territory. <a href="http://t.email3.telegraph.co.uk/r/?id=hd328e60,32f263f2,32f26406">View the advert</a>.</p>
