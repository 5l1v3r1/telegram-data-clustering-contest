      <p>Ford went official last night with the first addition to the Ford Mustang line in 55 years. The new vehicle was previously referred to as the "Mustang-inspired EV," and it has now officially debuted as the Ford Mustang Mach-E. As with most EVs on the market today, there are several versions of the Mach-E for buyers to choose from.</p>
      <p>The most potent is the Mach-E GT Performance Edition that is targeting a 0-60 mph sprint in the mid-3-second range with an estimated 459 horsepower along with 612 lb-ft of torque. Ford is also offering the Mach-E GT that will reach 60 mph in under 4-seconds, making it faster to 60 mph than the <a href="https://hothardware.com/tags/porsche">Porsche</a> Macan Turbo. The extended-range all-wheel-drive configuration of the Mach-E will start at 332 horsepower and 417 lb-ft of torque. Mach-E is also available in a rear-wheel-drive version.</p>

      <p>Ford will offer the Mach-E with the available extended-range battery pack that will drive at least 300 miles per charge. The extended-range version of the battery has 98.8 kWh of power with the base offering 75.7 kWh of power. Ford has a connected charging station offering that will add 32 miles of range per hour using a 240V outlet based on the extended-range, rear-wheel-drive configuration.</p>
      <p>A mobile charger is included that adds 22 miles of range per charge hour with a 240V outlet. A peak charging rate of 150 kW allows the rear-wheel-drive to add 47 miles of range in 10 minutes of charge with a DC fast-charge station. The standard range Mach-E can charge from 10 percent to 80 percent in 38 minutes on a DC fast charging station. Inside, the Mach-E adopts the Mustang's dual-cowl design along with some design cues from the Tesla Model S and Model Y -- namely with the large portrait-style touch screen. However, Ford has wisely added a second display screen in front of the steering wheel unlike the Model 3 and Model Y. Ford also says that the infotainment system uses next-gen Sync 4 technology, which supports wireless Apple CarPlay and wireless Android Auto.</p>

The First Edition is offered in extended-range all-wheel drive with red brake calipers, metallic pedal covers, contrast stitching on the seats, and more.

Standard Range AWD adds $2,700, Extended range RWD adds $5,000, and extended range AWD adds $7,700. First Edition starts at $59,900, and Select Edition starts at $43,885.
