      <p>Operatives of the Lagos State Environmental Sanitation and Special Offences (Enforcement) Unit have surrounded a house being guarded by a lion on Muri Okunola Street, Victoria Island.</p>
      <p><i>PUNCH Metro</i> gathered that the officials had been deployed in the house since Friday after residents petitioned the state government on the presence of the wild animal in the house.</p>
      <p>The animal reportedly belongs to an Indian national who rented an apartment in the house.</p>
      <p>The Head of the task force team, Mr. Yinka Egbeyemi, told <i>PUNCH Metro </i>that he had the instruction of the Commissioner for the Environment and the Ministry of Agriculture to tranquilise the animal today (Monday).</p>
      <p>He said the lion would be subsequently transferred to a zoo.</p>
      <p>Egbeyemi noted that the Indian might also be prosecuted, as he would have to explain how he brought the carnivore into the state.</p>
      <p>He said, “The lion was found on No. 229 Muri Okunola Street. Our Black Maria and men have been there since Friday. They will remove the animal on Monday.</p>
      <p>“The Indian man rented the apartment and lied to the owner of the house that he wanted to be staying there.</p>
      <p>“He claimed that the house was under renovation and brought the animal there.</p>
      <p>“The neighbours saw the thing and that was how we got a petition from them.</p>
      <p>“We have sent him a letter that he should come and talk to us. So, by tomorrow (Monday), we will like to know how he got the animal.</p>
      <p>“He will have to tell us why he is rearing a lion in a city; that is a wild animal and anything can happen. So, he may be prosecuted.”</p>
