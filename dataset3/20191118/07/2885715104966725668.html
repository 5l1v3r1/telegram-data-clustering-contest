      <p>The trailer of Good Newwz, starring <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/akshay-kumar/">Akshay Kumar</a>, <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/kareena-kapoor/">Kareena Kapoor</a>, Diljit Dosanjh and Kiara Advani in the lead roles, is out. The posters of Good Newwz promised the biggest goof-up of the year, and it seems the comedy-drama is set to ‘deliver’ precisely that.</p>
      <p>The film is about in vitro fertilisation (IVF). More specifically, it deals with the confusion (and comedy) that arises from a mix-up suffered by two couples at an IVF hospital.</p>
      <p>While Akshay Kumar is paired with Kareena Kapoor, Diljit Dosanjh will share screen space with Kiara Advani in Good Newwz.</p>

      <p>The “goof-up” that the film is all about can happen only in a Bollywood film, and yet the situation can make for some good comedy as the trailer suggests.</p>
      <p>Good Newwz also stars Adil Hussain and <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/tisca-chopra">Tisca Chopra</a>.</p>
      <p>The film’s synopsis reads, “Varun and Deepti Batra have met with the realisation that they need to have a kid before it’s too late. Little do they know that on this reproductive journey, their fates would get tied with another couple – Honey and Monika Batra. Their clash leads to hilarious, often ridiculous situations. How they overcome their hatred for each other and learn to take this journey together forms the crux of this ‘dramedy’ about love and acceptance, called GOOD NEWWZ!”</p>
      <p>Good Newwz is produced by <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/karan-johar/">Karan Johar</a>’s Dharma Productions and Akshay Kumar’s Cape of Good Films. It will release on December 27, 2019.</p>
