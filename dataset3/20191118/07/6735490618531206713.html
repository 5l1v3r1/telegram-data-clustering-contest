      <p>Black Eyed Peas founder will.i.am is calling out a Quantas flight attendant he alleges is “racist” after an in-flight altercation that resulted in the singer being greeted by police when his flight landed in Sydney, Australia.</p>
      <p>He took to Twitter to complain about the “overly aggressive flight attendant,” adding, “I don’t want to believe [she’s] racist. But she has clearly aimed all her frustrations only at the people of colour.”</p>

      <p>He explained what took place in a series of subsequent tweets, claiming he was met by police when the plane landed because the flight attendant — who he identified by name — called law enforcement because he didn’t put away his laptop when instructed, claiming he missed the announcement because he was wearing noise-cancelling headphones.</p>

      <p>His complaints quickly went viral, but will.i.am’s decision to name the flight attendant resulted in some of his fans issuing personal attacks at her, something he tried to shut down.</p>

      <p>The airline has responded to the incident, denying the flight attendant’s actions had anything do with the colour of will.i.am’s skin.</p>
      <p>“There was a misunderstanding on board, which seems to have been exacerbated by will.i.am wearing noise cancelling headphones and not being able to hear instructions from crew,” a Quantas spokesman told <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/william-racist-airport-flight-attendant-laptop-police-australia-a9205401.html"><i>The Independent</i></a>. “We completely reject the suggestion this had anything to do with race. We’ll be following up with will.i.am and wish him well for the rest of the tour.”</p>
      <p>Qantas also said they would be offering legal assistance to the flight crew member.</p>
      <p>“Absent a retraction, and if the crew member wanted to take the matter further, we’d certainly be willing to provide legal support for them to do this,” a spokesman told <i><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-australia-qantas-racism/qantas-urges-rapper-will-i-am-to-withdraw-racism-accusation-against-staffer-idUSKBN1XS0RX">Reuters</a></i>.</p>
