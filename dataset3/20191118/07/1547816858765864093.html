        <b>Things have been rough between Mahira Sharma and Shefali Jariwala, inside the Bigg Boss 13 house. We spoke to Mahira's mother, Sania about their constant fights and here's what she has to say</b>
      </p>
      <p>Bigg Boss 13 house witnesses a lot of fights daily. Among many such is the ones between Mahira Sharma and Shefali Jariwala. Their constant spats have become an entertaining dope for viewers and makers but Mahira's mother, Sania Sharms, is not liking this one bit. </p>
      <p>We spoke to Mahira's mother about Shefali and her daughter's fights and she had some real harsh words to share for the Kaanta Laga actress. </p>

      <p>"I find Shefali Jariwala extremely irritating. Why does she have to pick up fights with my daughter always? At least she should see her own age and target people. Mahira is too young for her. She can  go and fight with the other ladies of her age inside. Why Mahira? Not once but she had literally pushed my daughter twice during a task. What is the point of getting physical to the one who is so young. Not just me but my family and friends are also highly upset with Shefali's bad behaviour with Mahira. The moment they witness any fight on the show they call and tell me why are you letting this happen? We are there for you, take a stand and raise a voice against it," said Sania, Mahira's mother. </p>
      <p>The concerned mother also has no qualms if Mahira comes out from the show now, "I feel it's okay if she comes out because I can't see my daughter suffering so much inside. And she is not like others who are jobless. Mahira is a big name in the industry and she has a lot of work already in her hand. So, she doesn't have to think what to do next? She was the first one to sign the agreement for the show and due to that she couldn't take any other work. I heard Shefali Jariwala's Kaanta Laga song when Mahira was not even born. And now suddenly from somewhere she has appeared showing the world 'Main zinda hoon mujhe dekho.'"</p>

      <p>Well, now Mahira comes out or not, is definitely not in her hand, but as of now this mother-daughter duo are creating a lot of buzz inside and outside the Bigg boss 13 house. <br/><br/><br/><i>Image Source:- voot/msn</i></p>
