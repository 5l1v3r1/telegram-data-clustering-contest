        <b>A face from Michael Bailey’s (Ryan Russell) past arrives in Coronation Street during the coming episodes, as his ex-girlfriend Grace shows up on the cobbles with a pretty big secret in the form of Michael’s daughter — and it’s safe to say that her presence brings it with plenty of conflict not only for the young lad, but for the Bailey clan as a whole.</b>
      </p>
      <p>James (Nathan Graham) stays out all night, and when Michael reveals this to his family, Ed (Trevor Michael Georges) assumes that he spent the night with Bethany (<a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/lucy-fallon/">Lucy Fallon</a>) — much to Aggie (Lorna Laidlaw) and Michael’s dismay.</p>
      <p>When James finally surfaces, he’s hungover, and reveals that he spent the night with a guy called Dan, and now he can’t find his phone. As a result, Michael agrees to help him locate the missing device, and thus they set off on their search.</p>

      <p>As the pair wait to get the phone back in the Freshco’s car park, Michael is stunned to see ex-girlfriend Grace — and his daughter. However, Grace refuses to speak to him and drives off as a result.</p>

      <p>Later, Michael informs Aggie and Ed about what transpired in the car park. Not long afterwards, Grace shows up on their doorstep and tells Michael that they daughter is in need of a responsible father figure. In turn, Michael begs her for a chance to be a part of his child’s life, but Grace refuses to promise anything.</p>
      <p>Yes, all hope isn’t lost — that is, until Aggie speaks to Adam (Sam Robertson) about what rights Michael has as a parent. Grace discovers what she’s been up to and storms out of the house, claiming that it’s not worth the hassle. Michael’s fuming with his mum for having gone behind his back like that.</p>
      <p>Will he manage to forgive Aggie?</p>
      <p>What’s more, has he lost his chance to be a dad to his daughter?</p>
