      <h1>GOP Sen. Ron Johnson faults whistleblower for having 'exposed things that didn't need to be exposed'</h1>

      <p>A handful of Republicans <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/gop-senator-says-whistleblower-s-sources-exposed-things-didn-t-n1084286">went on the Sunday talk shows</a> to defend President Trump after a rough first week of public impeachment hearings.</p>
      <p>On Fox News, Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) argued that Democrats shouldn't impeach Trump for a scheme to withhold military aid from Ukraine until its president publicly announced investigations into Joe and Hunter Biden and the Democratic National Committee, because "it didn't happen" and "Ukraine got the money." Rep. Mike Turner (R-Ohio) told CNN that "it is not okay" for a U.S. president to even "raise his political opponent" in a phone call with a foreign leader, but it's also not "scandalous" because Trump acknowledged doing it when he released the partial transcript of his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky.</p>
      <p>On NBC's <i>Meet the Press</i>, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/sen-johnson-says-whistleblowers-sources-exposed-things-that-didnt-need-to-be-exposed/2019/11/17/ce0a9d1a-0952-11ea-bd9d-c628fd48b3a0_story.html">lamented</a> the "damage that's being done to our entire country through this entire impeachment process" and argued that "it's going to be very difficult for future presidents to have a candid conversation with a world leader, because now we've set the precedent of leaking transcripts" — an apparent reference to the White House's own transcript release. The whistleblower who flagged concerns about that call, and the subsequent public revelation of the behind-the-scenes struggle over Ukraine military aid, "has exposed things that didn't need to be exposed," Johnson told host Chuck Todd.</p>

      <p>"You seem to blame this on everybody but the president," Todd said. "I'm not blaming anybody, Chuck," Johnson replied. "Isn't the president's own behavior, which raised all of these yellow and red flags, isn't that why we're here?" Todd asked. Johnson said the whistleblower's lawyer has been advocating for impeachment since Trump's inauguration, Todd noted that Johnson suggested Hillary Clinton's impeachment before the election, and Johnson brought up former FBI agents Peter Strzok and Lisa Page. Johnson, protector of things that needn't be exposed, has <a href="https://twitter.com/emptywheel/status/1196254258297016321">released a year of Strzok and Page's private text messages</a>.</p>
