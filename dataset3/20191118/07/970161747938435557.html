      <p>A university union has said that people should be able to choose which skin colour they identify with.</p>
      <p>The Universities and Colleges Union says that regardless of skin tone, people should be able to say if they identify as black.</p>
      <p>The body, which represents 120,000 academics, set out their stance after facing criticism over the labelling of transgender people, saying they support self-identification in a variety of areas.</p>
      <p>The union <a href="https://www.ucu.org.uk/equality">said</a>: ‘Our rules commit us to ending all forms of discrimination, bigotry and stereotyping. UCU has a long history of enabling members to self-identify whether that is being black, disabled, LGBT+ or women.’</p>
      <p>They added: ‘UCU also supports a social, rather than a medical, model of gender recognition that will help challenge repressive gender stereotypes in the workplace and in society.’</p>

      <p>In the US Rachel Dolezal self-identified as black but was embarrassingly exposed as a white woman during a TV interview, leading her to face accusations of racism.</p>
      <p>She quit as an official at the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in 2015 after her parents said she was not black.</p>
      <p>They showed a picture of her with blonde hair and pale white skin.</p>
      <p>She continued to identify as black, once telling <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2017/03/29/rachel-dolezal-appears-on-lorraine-to-defend-transblack-identity-6540596/">Lorraine that she was ‘transblack’</a>.</p>
      <p>Sacha Baron Cohen’s character Ali G came in for allegations of racism. He would ask interview subjects ‘is it because I is black?’ despite being white.</p>
      <p>Sussex University philosophy professor Kathleen Stick said the union’s position on race was ‘nonsensical, anti-intellectual propaganda.’</p>
