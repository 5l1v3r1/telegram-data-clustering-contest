      <h1>Virgil van Dijk speaks out as he misses final Holland qualifier for 'personal reasons'</h1>
      <h2>Virgil van Dijk will play no part in Holland's final Euro 2020 qualifier against Estonia after pulling out of the squad for personal reasons</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T07:32:42+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 07:32</time> by <a rel="author">Liam Prenderville, http://www.facebook.com/mirrorfootball</a></address>
      <p>Virgil van Dijk says the Dutch are "back where they belong" after sealing automatic qualification for Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>Holland haven't qualified for the last two major tournaments but secured their place at next summer's European Championships with a 0-0 draw against Northern Ireland on Saturday.</p>
      <p>With the finals being held at 12 venues across Europe, the Netherlands could play their group stage matches at the Johan Cruyff Arena in Amsterdam, with the draw being made on November 30.</p>
      <p>Holland still have Estonia to play in their final qualifier but Van Dijk will not be involved due to personal reasons.</p>

      <p>"I'm very delighted that we are back at the Euros, back where we belong I think," Van Dijk said.</p>
      <p>"It means a lot to the people. I've heard we're going to probably play all our group games in Amsterdam, it will be massive.</p>
      <p>"It was a big thing for us to miss those tournaments, it was tough. .. We have missed two, maybe we have to get used to it again."</p>

      <p>Ronald Koeman's side are second in Group C, two points behind leaders Germany, the only side to beat them in the qualifiers.</p>
      <p>"We know we can improve, can do a lot better in certain aspects of the game," Van Dijk added.</p>
      <p>"But you know, we qualified after missing two tournaments, so we have to enjoy it."</p>
