      </p>
      <p>The Walking Dead has had us all fooled into thinking Siddiq (Avi Nash) was secretly working alongside the Whisperers after the brutal beheadings of season nine.</p>
      <p>But it turns out his right-hand man, Dante (Juan Javier Cardenas), was the spy and has been playing games on Siqqid all along, finally resulting in him killing his fellow doctor.</p>
      <p>Yes, you read that right – Siddiq is gone, deceased, and was strangled to death at the hands of his protégé in the latest instalment of the zombie hit, Open Your Eyes.</p>
      <p>But while we come to terms with losing yet another fan favourite, we’ve been left with a whole host of questions following episode seven, but let’s start with the most pressing…</p>
      <p>
        <b>How will Dante cover up Siddiq’s murder?</b>
      </p>

      <p>Dante has been jokingly flirting with Siddiq over the best part of season 10, so we were shocked to see him murder the man we were quietly hoping he’d end up with.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>But how is he going to cover this one up?</p>
      <p>We know that Siddiq has been battling with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder after he witnessed Alpha (Samantha Morton) kill his friends and stick their heads on spikes at the end of the last season.</p>
      <p>So, part of us believes Dante will frame a suicide, after all, Rosita did find her man attempting to take his own life earlier on in the episode.</p>
      <p>Whether or not she will believe he has gone through with it is still unknown, but this could be the only plausible get out Dante might have to keep spying on his enemies.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Will Dante’s secret be revealed?</b>
      </p>

      <p>Now, we’re pretty convinced Siddiq is dead (even though Negan, played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan, did manage to come back after having his throat slit in season nine), so he doesn’t need to worry about the doctor revealing his secret.</p>
      <p>But will Rosita keep on pushing for answers, or will she believe however Dante manages to cover up his death?</p>
      <p>Siddiq managed to find out that the community was falling ill because they were drinking an infected supply of water, so hopefully his baby mummy will start to get her strength back.</p>
      <p>And she’s not one to sit quietly and watch the world go by, no, if Rosita (Christian Serratos) catches wind that there’s something suspicious going on, she will not stop until she gets answers.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>While Dante will probably pretend to mourn the death of his ‘friend’, we think it won’t be long until questions will be asked – and he needs to watch his back.</p>
      <p>
        <b>How will Alpha react to losing a Whisperer at the hands of Carol?</b>
      </p>

      <p>While the Siddiq’s shock death might have our attention, we’re also pretty concerned for Carol (Melissa McBride) after her captive was murdered by Dante.</p>
      <p>In last week’s episode, she ended up kidnapping a Whisperer after trying to find the horde of walkers Alpha has been hiding.</p>
      <p>However, despite trying to keep him safe in their homemade prison, medication was mixed up and the enemy ended up dying in Alexandria.</p>
      <p>Once Alpha learns about this, she will obviously retaliate, even though it was one of her own who ended up murdering the man.</p>
      <p>Will this be Carol’s chance to kill Alpha? Or will she take down even more of our original people?</p>
      <p>
        <b>Will Lydia join the Whisperers again?</b>
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p>Carol asked Lydia (Cassady McClincy) for help and ended up shocking Gamma (Thora Birch) with her after learning the Whisperers believed Alpha had murdered her own daughter.</p>
      <p>When realising she had been used by Carol, the former Whisperer insisted she was on her own side before she crossed the border into Alpha’s territory and ran away.</p>
      <p>But where was she running to? And is this the last we’ll see of her?</p>
      <p>Advertisement</p>
      <p>We know that Lydia only had loyalties to the Alexandrians because she was dating the now dead community member, Henry.</p>
      <p>So, will she turn her back on the group and re-join her mother’s people, or will she come around and help fight against the Whisperers again?</p>
      <p>
        <b>How will Gamma deal now she knows Lydia is alive?</b>
      </p>

      </figure>
      <p>Gamma has found out that Alpha has been lying to her about Lydia’s ‘death’.</p>
      <p>The Whisperer came face to face with her leader’s daughter in the dead of night after she was led to believe that Lydia had been murdered.</p>
      <p>Now she knows how Alpha will lie to her people, will Gamma stay loyal? Or will she become the Alexandrian version of Dante and spy for our people on the enemy.</p>
      <p>She has recently been making friends with Aaron (Ross Marquand) and showed how upset she was that her sister had been murdered by Alpha.</p>
      <p>Gamma has reason not to like Alpha and has now learned that she is untrustworthy – giving her incentive to betray the show’s villain and take her down from the inside.</p>
