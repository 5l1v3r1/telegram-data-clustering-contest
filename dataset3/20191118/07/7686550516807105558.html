      <h1>Two thirds of parents miss the signs of depression in children</h1>
      <h2>Parewnts have been warned not to ignore the symptpoms</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T07:13:11+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 07:13</time> by <a rel="author">Neil Shaw</a></address>
      <p>Up to two-thirds of parents struggle to spot signs of depression in their children, warns a new study.</p>
      <p>Although the majority of mums and dads say they are confident that they would recognise if their child had depression, most admitted that there are “barriers” to spotting specific symptoms.</p>
      <p>Forty per cent of parents struggle to differentiate between normal mood swings and depression, according to research conducted by the University of Michigan in the United States.</p>
      <p>A further 30 per cent believe their children are good at hiding their feelings, with another third insisting that nothing would interfere with their ability to recognise signs of depression in their child.</p>
      <p>Professor Sarah Clark, the study’s co-director, said: “In many families, the preteen and teen years bring dramatic changes both in youth behaviour and in the dynamic between parents and children.</p>
      <p>“These transitions can make it particularly challenging to get a read on children’s emotional state and whether there is possible depression.</p>
      <p>“Some parents may be overestimating their ability to recognise depression in the mood and behaviour of their own child.</p>
      <p>“An overconfident parent may fail to pick up on the subtle signals that something is amiss.”</p>

      <p>The poll also suggests that depression is a familiar topic for today’s schoolchildren.</p>
      <p>One-in-four parents said their child knows a classmate or peer with depression, and one-in-ten added that their child knows someone who has committed suicide.</p>
      <p>According to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, a US public health body, the suicide rate among those aged between 10 and 24 climbed by 56 per cent between 2007 and 2017.</p>
      <p>Prof Clark added: “Our report reinforces that depression is not an abstract concept for today’s teens and preteens, or their parents.</p>
      <p>“This level of familiarity with depression and suicide is consistent with recent statistics showing a dramatic increase in suicide among US youth over the past decade.</p>
      <p>“Rising rates of suicide highlight the importance of recognising depression in youth.”</p>
      <p>Parents should stay vigilant on spotting any signs of potential depression in their kids, she said, pointing to sadness, isolation, anger and irritability as key indicators.</p>
      <p>Professor Clark added that parents could perhaps talk with their child about identifying a “go to” adult who can be a trusted confidant if they are feeling down.</p>
      <p>The poll also found that most parents believe that schools should play a role in identifying potential depression, with seven-in-ten supporting depression screenings starting in secondary school.</p>
      <p>Professor Clark added: “The good news is that parents view schools as a valuable partner in recognising youth depression.</p>
      <p>“The bad news is that too few schools have adequate resources to screen students for depression, and to offer counselling to students who need it.”</p>
      <p>The findings were based on responses from more than 800 American parents with at least one child in secondary school.</p>
      <h3>Signs of depression in children according to the NHS</h3>
      <p>Symptoms of depression in children often include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>sadness, or a low mood that doesn't go away</li>
        <li>being irritable or grumpy all the time</li>
        <li>not being interested in things they used to enjoy</li>
        <li>feeling tired and exhausted a lot of the time</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Your child may also:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>have trouble sleeping or sleep more than usual</li>
        <li>not be able to concentrate</li>
        <li>interact less with friends and family</li>
        <li>be indecisive</li>
        <li>not have much confidence</li>
        <li>eat less than usual or overeat</li>
        <li>have big changes in weight</li>
        <li>seem unable to relax or be more lethargic than usual</li>
        <li>talk about feeling guilty or worthless</li>
        <li>feel empty or unable to feel emotions (numb)</li>
        <li>have thoughts about suicide or self-harming</li>
        <li>actually self-harm, for example, cutting their skin or taking on overdose</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Some children have problems with anxiety as well as depression. Some also have physical symptoms, such as headaches and stomach aches.</p>
      <p>Problems at school can be a sign of depression in children and teenagers and so can problem behaviour, especially in boys.</p>
      <p>Older children who are depressed may misuse drugs or alcohol.</p>
      <h3>Why is my child depressed?</h3>
      <p>Things that increase the risk of depression in children include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>family difficulties</li>
        <li>bullying</li>
        <li>physical, emotional or sexual abuse</li>
        <li>a family history of depression or other mental health problems</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Sometimes depression is triggered by one difficult event, such as parents separating, a bereavement or problems with school or other children.</p>
      <p>Often it's caused by a mixture of things. For example, your child may have inherited a tendency to depression and also have experienced some difficult life events.</p>
      <h3>If you think your child is depressed</h3>
      <p>If you think your child may be depressed, it's important to talk to them. Try to find out what's troubling them and how they are feeling.</p>
      <p>See some tips on talking to younger children and talking to teenagers.</p>
      <p>Whatever is causing the problem, take it seriously. It may not seem a big deal to you, but it could be a major problem for your child.</p>
      <p>If your child doesn't want to talk to you, let them know that you are concerned about them and that you're there if they need you.</p>
      <p>Encourage them to talk to someone else they trust, such as another family member, a friend or someone at school.</p>
      <p>It may be helpful for you to talk to other people who know your child, including their other parent.</p>
      <p>You could also contact their school to see if they have any concerns.</p>
      <h3>When to get medical help</h3>
      <p>If you think your child is depressed, make an appointment with them to see your GP.</p>
      <p>If necessary they can refer your child to their local child and adolescent mental health service (CAMHS) for specialist help.</p>
