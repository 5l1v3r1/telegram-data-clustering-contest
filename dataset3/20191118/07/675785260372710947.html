      <p>Beverley, who first appeared on the soap in 1989, will soon go on tour with the comedy The Thunder Girls.</p>
      <p>She joined the theatre show based on the best-selling novel alongside Coleen Nolan and Emmerdale's Sandra Marvin earlier this year.</p>

      <p>She said: "There’s very little work in our industry for women over 50, but I’m 62 and recently I was doing three jobs at once.</p>
      <p>"It made me realise how I was privileged to have the opportunity to do so when so many women my age no longer get the chance."</p>
      <p>She added: "I’m sick of ageism in the industry.</p>
      <p>"Although I’ve had to leave the safety net of being in <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/coronation-street">Coronation Street</a> to do this, I’m hoping that ageist bosses, of which there are many, take note of how successful this show is and it starts the ball rolling on helping other women my age, get the roles they still deserve."</p>
