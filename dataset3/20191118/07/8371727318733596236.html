      <h1>Microsoft is Hitting the Final Nail to Cortana’s Coffin</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T07:51:54+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 07:51</time> by <a rel="author">Kiruti Itimu</a></address>
      <p>Remember Cortana? You probably don’t use it often and Microsoft is kind of admitting that with a recent change.</p>
      <p>According to a <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4531683">support article</a> posted on several markets, Microsoft says they are ending support for the Cortana app on Android and iOS. Microsoft says they will end support for the Cortana app on Android and iOS on January 31st 2020.</p>
      <p>If you are an ardent user of Cortana, content such as reminders and lists will no longer function in the Cortana app or Microsoft Launcher. However, interesting enough you can still access them through Cortana on Windows. Microsoft also says that Cortana reminders, lists and tasks are automatically synced to Microsoft’s To Do app and they want you to download that app to use it.</p>
      <p>This means that on January 31st 2020, there will be an updated version of Microsoft Launcher which will have Cortana removed, thereby sending Cortana to the tech graveyard that has Windows Phone.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, Microsoft’s CEO, Satya Nadella said that he no longer sees Cortana as a competitor to Amazon’s Alexa or Google Assistant and instead he said Cortana should be a skill for anybody who’s a Microsoft 365 subscriber. True to that word, Microsoft explained in the support article that the will integrate Cortana into the Microsoft 365 productivity apps</p>
      <p>Microsoft launched Cortana for iOS and Android back in 2015 and it was the company’s answer to Apple’s Siri and Google Now. It was available first on Windows 10 and later on was expanded to the mobile platforms. Apparently over 800 million people had access to Cortana as of 2019, which is impressive in its own right.</p>
      <p>Since Cortana is basically dead now, can we get Clippy back? Please?</p>
