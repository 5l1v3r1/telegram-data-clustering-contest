      <p>Samoa was finalising plans for a compulsory measles vaccination programme Monday, after declaring a state of emergency as a deadly epidemic sweeps the Pacific nation.</p>
      <p>At least six fatalities, including five children, have been linked to the outbreak of the virus, which has also hit other island states such as Tonga and Fiji.</p>
      <p>Samoa is the worst affected with more than 700 cases reported from across all areas of the country, prompting the government on Friday to invoke emergency powers.</p>
      <p>Declaring a state of emergency, the government said plans for compulsory measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) immunisations would be published on Monday.</p>
      <p>"MMR vaccinations for members of the public who have not yet received a vaccination injection is now a mandatory legal requirement for all of Samoa," it said.</p>
      <p>A national emergency operations centre to coordinate the measles response was opened on Monday.</p>
      <p>However, no information was immediately available on how the vaccinations would be administered or whether those who were not immunised would face sanctions.</p>
      <p>Children are the most vulnerable to measles, which typically causes a rash and fever but can also lead to blindness, brain damage and death.</p>
      <p>Samoa has closed all schools, kindergartens and the country's only university in a bid to halt the virus' spread.</p>
      <p>New Zealand, which is experiencing its own measles outbreak in the Auckland region, will this week send 12 nurses and 3,000 MMR doses to assist Samoa's public health response.</p>
      <p>University of Auckland immunologist Helen Petousis-Harris said even though measles was already widespread, the mass rollout of vaccinations could help limit the number of cases and reduce the death count.</p>
      <p>She said it was also important to boost Samoa's low levels of immunisation and help prevent future outbreaks.</p>
      <p>"In Samoa, the proportion of people who are immune to measles is very, very low, one of the lowest in the world," she told AFP.</p>
      <p>"So if they aren't able to improve that, this is going to happen again."</p>
      <p>The country's vaccination programme was briefly suspended last year when two babies died shortly after being given a vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella (MMR).</p>
      <p>Subsequent investigations found the problem was not the widely used vaccine but the fact that the nurses administering prepared it incorrectly.</p>
      <p>Neighbouring Tonga last week announced government primary schools and kindergartens would be closed until later this month as the number of measles cases in the kingdom approaches 200.</p>
      <p>Fiji has reported four cases but says they are contained to a township west of the capital Suva.</p>
