      <h1>Signing Kubica for 2020 'would be great' - Szafnauer</h1>
      <h2>Team boss <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/otmar-szafnauer/"><b>Otmar Szafnauer</b></a> has confirmed that <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/formula-1/force-india/"><b>Racing Point</b></a> is also pushing to sign up <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/robert-kubica/"><b>Robert Kubica</b></a> for 2020.</h2>

      <p>At the end of a fraught return to the grid for the Pole this year, Kubica admitted that he is looking forward to the season finale in Abu Dhabi.</p>
      <p>"Very good," he said in Brazil when asked about his late-season mood.</p>
      <p>"Good because it's the last race. I have to be honest, it was a very long season."</p>
      <p>Kubica's sponsor PKN Orlen will also leave Williams after Abu Dhabi, and it is believed the Polish oil company is in talks with <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/formula-1/haas/"><b>Haas</b></a> and Racing Point.</p>
      <p>Kubica looks set to become a test and reserve driver, and combine that role with a race seat in another series like DTM.</p>
      <p>Haas boss <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/gunther-steiner/"><b>Gunther Steiner</b></a> has said openly that he wants to sign the 34-year-old.</p>
      <p>"I hope that in the coming days we will be able to announce something," he said in Brazil.</p>
      <p>But Racing Point also wants to secure Kubica and his backing.</p>
      <p>"It would be great if we had Robert on the team," boss Otmar Szafnauer told Poland's Eleven Sports.</p>
      <p>"We respect him a lot, so it would be great if he could help us as a team."</p>
