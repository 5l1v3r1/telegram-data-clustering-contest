        <b>Police in California say four people have died after ten people were shot at a party in the US state.</b>
      </p>
      <p>It happened in the city of Fresno, around 300 kilometres south of San Francisco, at around 8pm on Sunday night.</p>
      <p>It's believed a gunman entered the backyard of a home where people were watching a football game, opened fire and then fled.</p>
      <p>Three men died at the scene, while another later died in hospital.</p>
      <p>Officers say the six other people who were hurt in the attack are in hospital with non-life threatening gunshot wounds.</p>
      <p>Fresno Police Department Deputy Chief Michael Reed told reporters: "There was about 35 people... inside the house and inside the back yard.</p>
      <blockquote>"They were at a football party, so this was a family gathering."</blockquote>
      <p>He added: "This is senseless violence - we're going to do everything we can to find out who the perpetrators are and bring them to justice."</p>
