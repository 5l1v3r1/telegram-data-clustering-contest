      <h1>Dosist sets out to redefine edible cannabis products with Dose Dial</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T07:00:01+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 07:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.dezeen.com/author/rima-sabina-aouf/" target="_blank">Rima Sabina Aouf</a></address>
      <p>Los Angeles-based brand Dosist has designed a "sleek and discreet" <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/tag/marijuana/">cannabis</a> dispenser called Dose Dial, which issues dose-controlled tablets.</p>
      <p>A follow-up to the brand's Dose Pen for vaping, the pocket-sized Dose Dial is <a href="https://dosist.com/">Dosist</a>'s take on cannabis edibles â€” a product category more associated with gummy candies or chocolates.</p>
      <p>In contrast, the Dose Dial is a minimalist tablet dispenser. Users push the button and turn the wheel with their index finger to dispense one peppermint-flavoured tablet.</p>
      <p>"We were intentional in every detail, with a design objective to challenge and redefine the edible category, a historically recreational and intoxication-focused consumption space," Dosist chief marketing officer Anne-Marie Dacyshyn told Dezeen.</p>

      <p>The dispenser design itself is another differentiating element, as the childproof, recyclable product is designed to be "sleek and discreet".</p>
      <p>"It's key we address some of the entrenched stereotypes that still exist in the space," said Dacyshyn. "Design is a crucial element to change the narrative and bring people into this category just like they do with their current lifestyle accessories."</p>

      <p>The Dose Dial contains tiny, white 3.7-milligram sublingual tablets, which means they dissolve under the tongue.</p>
      <p>This method of delivery allows them to be partially absorbed into the body through the mouth tissue, avoiding the unpredictable effects that come from ingesting edibles wholly through the gut.</p>
      <p>It suits the Dosist brand, which is all about precise doses and targeted formulations that achieve a specific health benefit for the user, rather than getting them high.</p>

      <p>The Dose Dials are available in Dosist's two most popular formulas, Bliss or Calm, in corresponding green or blue toned packaging. Bliss contains tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol in a ration of 9:1, while the Calm formula is a near-direct inverse at 1:10.</p>
      <p>The Dose Pens, launched in 2016, also come in Sleep, Relief, Arouse and Passion formulas.</p>

      <p>There has been an explosion in <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2017/04/20/five-best-marijuana-designs-smoking-roundup/">cannabis-related products and technologies</a> since US states began legalising recreational marijuana use in 2012.</p>
      <p>Dosist is one of several companies vying to establish itself as the Apple of cannabis, associated with a premium and grown-up lifestyle.</p>
      <p>Founded initially under the name Hmbldt in 2016, it positions itself as a wellness brand rather than a cannabis brand, and even operates a number of stores designed as calming "wellness experiences" with interiors that appear to nod to Apple and Aesop.</p>
      <p>"What's key for us is to define which space we are addressing," said Dacyshyn. "At Dosist we are 100 per cent focused on the wellness side of cannabis use."</p>

      <p>She said the company will next focus on expanding its stores beyond California and Nevada to Colorado, Michigan and Arizona, as well as Canada.</p>
      <p>It will also continue to develop products based on its dual key pillars of dose control and targeted formulations.</p>
      <p>Other offerings in this market include <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2019/06/05/standard-dose-cbd-store-new-york-city/">New York shop Standard Dose</a>, which offers yoga and spa services alongside its CBD products, and <a href="https://www.dezeen.com/2017/06/30/serra-cannabis-dispensary-portland-greenhouse-display-cases-omfgco-jhl-design/">Portland dispensary Serra</a>, with an interior by OMFGCo and JHL Design.</p>
