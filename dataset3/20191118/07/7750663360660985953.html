      <h2><a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/mattia-binotto/"><b>Mattia Binotto</b></a> was furious after <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/formula-1/ferrari/"><b>Ferrari</b></a>'s drivers collided in the closing stages of the Brazilian GP.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T07:15:42+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 07:15</time> by <a rel="author">GMM F1</a></address>
      <p>Even before the Interlagos crash, the relationship between <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/sebastian-vettel/"><b>Sebastian Vettel</b></a> and <a href="https://www.sportsmole.co.uk/people/charles-leclerc/"><b>Charles Leclerc</b></a> was already unsettled as they vie for top status.</p>
      <p>"The two drivers must realise that they have damaged the team," said Binotto, the Maranello team's usually-calm team boss.</p>
      <p>"I don't want to judge right now who made the mistake, but it is necessary to give a strong signal to them that certain things cannot happen," he told Italian media.</p>
      <p>"We now pay as a team and our image. With all the work that we do, it's not good."</p>
      <p>Binotto said he was contemplating calling off the post-race driver debrief to make clear that Ferrari will not tolerate such incidents.</p>
      <p>"We are considering not doing the debrief," he confirmed. "At times it is necessary to give a strong signal."</p>
      <p>Vettel, however, denied blame for the incident, although he admitted it was "a rather aggressive fight".</p>
      <p>Leclerc, meanwhile, insisted: "I believe that neither of us did anything stupid.</p>
      <p>"But we are both mature enough to know that these things must not happen.</p>
      <p>"It happened at the wrong time, as we are both fighting for third place in the championship, and I am very sorry. But I am sure that the relationship with Seb will not change."</p>
      <p>Binotto continued: "They must understand that both have a part of the blame."</p>
      <p>Before the race, both Leclerc and Vettel admitted they would be pushing hard in Brazil and Abu Dhabi to secure third place in the drivers' championship.</p>
      <p>"We let them fight freely because we are already second in the constructors' championship, so they could fight for their position in the drivers' championship," said Binotto.</p>
      <p>"We have been criticised in the past for interfering too much in a fight, but to fight freely does not mean to do stupid things, especially this.</p>
      <p>"We spoke out after Monza, and in my view the drivers had a good relationship after that. But the race today has certainly not helped in this regard," the Italian added.</p>
      <p>Finally, Binotto said the only positive from the crash is that it gives him "the opportunity to clarify the internal rules before the coming season".</p>
      <p>"This is something that should not be repeated."</p>
