      <p>She posted: "Me and Josh have decided to part ways.</p>
      <p>"Sadly the relationship seems to have broken drown.</p>
      <p>"Hoping we can still remain civil and wish him the best for the future."</p>
      <p>The couple didn't seem too down about the end of their romance, with Josh enjoying a night out with his pals yesterday and posting videos from a club on Instagram.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile Charlotte looked upbeat as she posted content on her own Instagram Story.</p>
      <p>The split comes just months after Charlotte moved from the north east to live with Josh in his hometown of Bolton.</p>
      <p>They often shared snaps from inside the lavish £450,000 property.</p>
      <p>The couple recently starred on the latest series of Celebs Go Dating, and Charlotte opened up about how difficult she was finding leaving her dream home to move in with Josh.</p>

        <figcaption>Charlotte didn't look too upset on her story either</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>She burst into tears as she revealed to agent Anna Williamson that she was struggling with the transition.</p>
      <p>"It's a big deal and sometimes I don't think he (Josh) recognises how much a big deal it is," she said.</p>
      <p>Charlotte went on: "I am moving away from everyone I love."</p>

      <p>When asked by Anna why she had decided to move in with Josh, a teary Charlotte said: "I want to be with him and I feel excited about starting afresh."</p>
      <p>She then started to cry and confessed that her "huge house" in Newcastle is "empty" and "not a good place to be when you're on your own."</p>
      <p>They became official in February 2018 with an Instagram snap captioned: "9.2.18."</p>
      <p>However, their relationship hit the rocks after a blazing row back in September 2018 and rumours circulated that the couple had split after they had unfollowed each other on Instagram.</p>
      <p>They have travelled the world together and featured on various TV programmes together including Celebs Go Dating, Just Tattoo Of Us and Celebrity Coach Trip.</p>
