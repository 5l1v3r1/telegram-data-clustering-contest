      <h3>Key Quotes</h3>
      <p>“<b><a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/eurjpy">EUR/JPY</a></b> saw a decent bounce from the 55 day ma last week, this is located at 119.35 currently. Rallies should find initial resistance at the 20 day ma at 120.54. This guards tougher <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance">resistance</a>, at 121.34/85. This is the location of the 200 day ma, the 50% <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance/fibonacci">Fibonacci</a> retracement and the late July high”.</p>
      <p>“While capped here attention remains on the 118.61 uptrend. This should hold the initial test, however longer term the risk has increased for a break lower. Failure here will target the 117.09 October low ahead of the 115.87 September low”.</p>
