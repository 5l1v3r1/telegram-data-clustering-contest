      <h1>WA Police to do more with less over summer</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T01:14:13+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 01:14</time> by <a rel="author">AAP</a></address>
      <p>WESTERN Australia will experience a bigger police presence on its streets this summer but without more officers being hired.</p>
      <p>Police Minister Michelle Roberts announced a $5 million funding package on Sunday dedicated to addressing “historical spikes in crime over the summer months”.</p>
      <p>Operation Heat Shield would seek to provide more than 50,000 additional police hours by boosting the number of shifts, she said.</p>
      <p>However the state’s police union has received the announcement with scepticism, saying staffing shortages are critical and additional hours for existing officers will only stretch their capabilities.</p>
      <p>“This is yet another knee jerk reaction by the McGowan government,” WA Police Union President Harry Arnott said.</p>
      <p>“They are missing the bigger picture and they are failing to support the community and policing.</p>
      <p>“The government’s lack of commitment to increasing police numbers has created police shortages, putting increased pressure on officers to do more with less and placing the community at risk.”</p>
      <p>According to the union, there are 128 long-term vacancies across the Perth, plus 90 long term vacancies in regional WA.</p>
      <p>“These vacancies mean more than 400 police cars are off the road each and every week,” the union said.</p>
      <p>Heat Shield is timed to run from December 1 to May 31.</p>
      <p>Patrols will be stepped up over its duration at suburban centres, in Perth’s CBD and shopping, entertainment and transport hubs to deter anti-social behaviour.</p>
      <p>“This is about being pro-active and giving the community reassurance,” Ms Roberts said.</p>
      <p>“This increased police presence in suburban and regional centres across the state and will be on a scale never before seen in Western Australia.”</p>
