      <p>The makers of Tanhaji -The Unsung Warrior are leaving no stone unturned in adding to the film’s hype, as with each passing day, Ajay Devgn has been unveiling new promos. Other than Ajay Devgn as a fierce and brave Tanaji Malusare, the film boasts of a highly-ensemble cast and the back-to-back convincing character posters serve as enough proof. Today, the actor took to his social media and shared a new promo, which doesn’t show anyone’s face but has still sent fans into a tizzy. (ALSO READ - <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/bollywood/news/same-to-same-saif-ali-khan-s-first-look-poster-from-tanhaji-is-a-complete-rip-off-of-jon-snow-from-got-we-have-proof/5dcd0e2287fb571eff7e3d99">SAME-TO-SAME: Saif Ali Khan’s First Look Poster From Tanhaji Is A Complete Rip-Off Of Jon Snow From GoT; We Have Proof</a>)</p>
      <p>The clip shows two hands, all drenched, exchanging golden bangles. It made fans wonder if the two hands are that of Ajay and Kajol, as the latter will be playing the role of Tanaji Malusare's wife Savitri Malusare. Other than the visuals, it’s the promos super-intense background score that calls for attention. And by the looks of it, we are assuming that the makers have sure done justice to this one of the most important milestones in the history of India.</p>
