      <h1>Palace strikes back at US senator: Shameful</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T01:30:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 01:30</time> by <a rel="author">MJ Blancaflor</a></address>
      <p>Malacañang on Sunday slammed presidential candidate and United States Senator Bernie Sanders for his “shameful attempt” to criticize human rights situation in the country without validating his information.</p>
      <p>This came after Sanders denounced the recent police repression of trade unionists as “a shameful attempt to silence people’s rights and freedoms.”</p>
      <p>In a tweet Friday, Sanders wrote: “In recent years, we have seen abhorrent human rights abuses by the Philippine government. This repression of trade unionists is a shameful attempt to silence people’s rights and freedoms. More than ever, we must stand on the side of global human rights.</p>
      <p>Sanders was reacting to a report that 57 members of labor and civil groups in the Philippines were arrested and detained during simultaneous raids in Bacolod City, Negros Oriental, and Manila in Oct. 31.</p>
      <p>The Philippine National Police raided the offices of the Kilusang Mayo Uno, Gabriela Negros Center, and the Negros Federation of Sugar Workers.</p>
      <p>The International Trade Union Confederation has condemned the arrest of unionists and leftist groups.</p>
      <p>“Under the cover of being tough on crime, this government is targeting human and trade union rights defenders as part of a deliberate political strategy that relies on the suppression of people’s rights and freedoms,” said ITUC General Secretary Sharan Burrow.</p>
      <p>Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo responded to Sanders by saying that reciting unverified information public is equally “shameful.”</p>
      <p>“It is a shameful attempt on his part to give information that was not validated. He only repeated what the critics have been saying which are peddled by [a] foreign news agency... which he believes,” Panelo said in a radio interview.</p>
      <p>He also defended the raids on the offices of leftist groups offices that resulted in several arrests.</p>
      <p>“If the PNP conducts raids, it means they have intelligence reports that these organizations are doing something wrong and committing unlawful acts,” Panelo said.</p>
      <p>“If there were something wrong during raids, they can always go to court and sue them,” he added.</p>
      <p>The police earlier denied the allegations of some leftist groups that firearms and ammunition were planted during the raids.</p>
      <p>Lt. Gen. Archie Francisco Gamboa, officer-in-charge of PNP, challenged leftist groups to prove that they are innocent.  </p>
