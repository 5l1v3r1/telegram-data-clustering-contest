      <h3>Key Quotes:</h3>
      <p>ECB could buy other assets if the economic situation in the eurozone deteriorates significantly.</p>
      <p>Right now, we are doing unconventional things.</p>
      <p>You could -- of course -- imagine even more unconventional things if the situation gets really bad.</p>
      <p>There are ways to go beyond the government bonds, and a little bit of corporates and other assets that we are buying now.”</p>
      <p>The comments show that the central bank is alarmed by the deteriorating Eurozone growth outlook and stands prepared to do more if the situation worsens. The <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/eurusd">EUR/USD</a> pair is unperturbed the above comments and keeps its range above the 1.1050 level.</p>
