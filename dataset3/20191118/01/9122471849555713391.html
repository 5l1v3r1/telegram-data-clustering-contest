      <h1>Urban Meyer Tweets Message Ahead Of Ohio State-Penn State</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T01:03:49+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 01:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/matthladik" target="_blank">Matt Hladik</a></address>
      <p>Ohio State will host Penn State in a battle for the Big Ten East this Saturday. Urban Meyer is certainly ready for the game.</p>
      <p>Meyer will be on hand as part of FOX’s pregame show and if you were wondering if he was going to remain neutral, his message to Ohio State fans tonight ended any possibility of that.</p>
      <p>“See you Saturday for the @CFBONFOX Big Noon Kickoff Show, Buckeye Nation! #GoBucks,” Meyer wrote on Twitter.</p>

      <p>Meyer has been forthcoming about the fact he keeps in touch with his replacement at OSU, Ryan Day. Day is two wins away from an undefeated regular season, a feat Meyer also accomplished in his first campaign at Ohio State back in 2012.</p>
      <p>In order to get to 12-0, Day will have to lead the Buckeyes past Penn State this weekend and Michigan in the season finale. From there, Minnesota will likely be waiting in the Big Ten Championship Game.</p>
      <p>Ohio State and Penn State will kick off at noon ET Saturday on FOX.</p>
