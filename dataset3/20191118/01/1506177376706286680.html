      <p>A monument dedicated to the Armenian Genocide of 1915 was unveiled in Kalamata, Messinia on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The ceremony was presided by His Holiness Archbishop Kegham Khatcherian, Prelate of the Armenian Apostolic Church of Greece.</p>
      <p>At the heart of the monument is a cross carved in red marble which was brought from Armenia. The colour is of significance as it symbolises the blood of the Armenians who witnessed the genocide.</p>
      <p>The unveiling of the monument took place after Divine Liturgy at the chapel of Saint Nicholas of Ephesus, which has been granted to the Armenian Community of Kalamata for Â their religious ceremonies.</p>
