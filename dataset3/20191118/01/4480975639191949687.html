      <h1>Australia: Oct MI Leading Index preview - Westpac</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T01:56:37+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 01:56</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/dhwani-mehta" target="_blank">Dhwani Mehta</a></address>
      <p>According to the analysts at Westpac, the October month MI Leading Index is likely to come in weaker once again following September’s -0.92%.</p>
      <h3>Key Quotes:</h3>
      <p>“The Leading Index growth rate fell more materially below trend in September, to –0.92% from –0.24% in August. The signal indicates growth is likely to remain below trend through the first half of 2020.</p>
      <p>The October update looks likely to see another weak read. It will include softer component updates for the ASX200; the Westpac-MI Unemployment Expectations Index and total hours worked. It will also see more weak reads on US industrial production and commodity prices (-2% in AUD terms vs -3.7% last month). These will be partially offset by firmer reads for the Westpac-MI Consumer Expectations Index, dwelling approvals and a widening yield spread.”</p>
