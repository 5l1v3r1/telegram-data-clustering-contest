      <p>Japanese telco SoftBank Corp announced on Monday plans to merge its internet unit <a href="https://indianexpress.com/about/yahoo/">Yahoo</a> Japan with messaging app operator Line Corp, as it scoops up struggling internet companies to bulk up against rivals such as Rakuten.</p>
      <p>SoftBank said in a statement that Yahoo Japan, which last month changed its name to Z Holdings, will merge with Line, owned by South Korea’s Naver Corp, in a deal to be completed by October 2020.</p>
      <p>The companies aim for a definitive agreement by next month in a transaction that will see SoftBank Corp and Naver form a 50:50 venture that will control Z Holdings, which will in turn operate Line and Yahoo.</p>
      <p>SoftBank Corp is a unit of investment behemoth SoftBank Group Corp.</p>
      <p>SoftBank Corp and Naver, which owns 73% of money-losing Line, plan to launch a tender offer for Line’s remaining shares at 5,200 yen per share, a 13.4% premium to the share price before news of the merger broke. Line’s shares were up 2.6% at 5,180 yen in early trading on Monday.</p>
      <p>Z Holdings will continue to be a consolidated subsidiary of SoftBank. It will hold a press conference with Line at 0800 GMT.</p>
