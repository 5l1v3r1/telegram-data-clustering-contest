      <p>NORTHERN Ireland midfielder Corry Evans hopes boss Michael O’Neill will stay on for next summer’s European Championships - if they get there.</p>
      <p>Saturday night’s 0-0 draw with the Netherlands ended any slim automatic promotion hopes as they prepare to take on Germany in Frankfurt tomorrow night.</p>
      <p>However, Northern Ireland are guaranteed a play-off semi-final on March 26, with a decider in March 31 up for grabs.</p>
      <p>O’Neill, who was recently appointed manager of struggling English Championship side Stoke City, has already committed to leading Northern Ireland into the play-offs.</p>
      <p>And Evans hopes his reign could extend into the summer if Northern Ireland get that far.</p>
      <p>“Yes,” said the Blackburn man, “he’s been magnificent for us and has taken us from where we were eight years ago to what we are doing now.</p>
      <p>“We are in contention all the time to qualify and he’s been a huge help in our international careers.</p>
      <p>“He has helped make dreams come true by reaching major tournaments and even like against Holland, we are in games against big nations and we compete against them.</p>
      <p>“A lot of that is down to Michael.”</p>
      <p>There may be little but pride at stake when they run out at the Commerzbank Arena tomorrow night, but Evans insists Northern Ireland must try and build on their impressive back-to-back showings against the Dutch.</p>
      <p>And, just as they did against the Germans at Windsor Park back in September, O’Neill’s men started on the front foot on Saturday night.</p>
      <p>“That’s what we wanted to do,” said the 29-year-old.</p>
      <p>“It was similar to the Germany game at Windsor in the first half when we tried to get pressure higher up the pitch and nick the ball.</p>
      <p>“When we win the ball higher up the pitch we are closer to the goal to try and score and that created a few chances for us. Unfortunately we didn’t take our chances again.</p>
      <p>“Overall we can be pleased. We have shown in the two games against Holland that we are more than a match for them and we have to take confidence from this and carry it forward.</p>
      <p>“The German match away is going to be another difficult test for us but we have nothing to lose. We will go there and give it our best shot.”</p>
      <p>Cardiff City winger Gavin Whyte echoed those sentiments, and believes tomorrow night is an opportunity to go out on a high before next March.</p>
      <p>“We haven’t spoken about the play-off. It’s nice to know it’s secure but we still want to go [to Germany] and win before then,” said the former Crusaders man.</p>
      <p>“We want momentum and hopefully we can get another good result. We will be ready. We are a wee bit disappointed to draw this game because we had chances and we probably could have nicked one but that’s football.</p>
      <p>“It says a lot about how far we’ve come in the past couple of years that we are disappointed to draw with the Netherlands.”</p>
