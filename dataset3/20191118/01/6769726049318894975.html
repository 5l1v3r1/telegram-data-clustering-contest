      <p>A CYCLIST is in a serious condition in hospital after he was allegedly struck by a Jeep in a hit and run in Girrawheen.</p>
      <p>About 7.30pm on Saturday, it is alleged a 49-year old man was at a shopping centre on Marangaroo Drive and Templeton Avenue.</p>
      <p>The victim, an 18-year-old man from Noranda, was also at the shopping centre in company with friends.</p>
      <p>Police alleged an altercation occurred between the man, the victim and his friends.</p>
      <p>It is alleged the man began to drive his Jeep Cherokee towards them.</p>
      <p>The victim, who was riding a bicycle, rode through the car park trying to escape as the man allegedly continued to drive the Jeep towards him at speed.</p>
      <p>Police said as the victim approached the western end of the car park on his bicycle, he slowed down as he mounted the kerb and the man continued to drive the Jeep towards him.</p>
      <p>It is further alleged the man drove the Jeep at speed directly into the back of the victimâ€™s bicycle before driving the Jeep over the top of the victim and the bicycle before slowing down and coming to a stop on the edge of the median strip.</p>
      <p>It is alleged the man at no time rendered any assistance or checked on the welfare of the victim who was lying on the ground behind the Jeep.</p>
      <p>He was arrested a short time later by police.</p>
      <p>The victim, an 18-year-old man from Noranda, was taken by ambulance to Royal Perth Hospital with life-threatening injuries.</p>
      <p>The 49-year-old man from Girrawheen appeared before the Perth Magistrates Court yesterday charged with dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm, failing to stop and ensure assistance received after incident occasioning grievous bodily harm and failing to comply with a requirement to provide sample or accompany police.</p>
