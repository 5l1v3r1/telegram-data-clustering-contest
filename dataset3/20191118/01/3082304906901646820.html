        <b>Vaughn Taylor and Brendon Todd lead the Mayakoba Golf Classic ahead of a Monday finish.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Vaughn Taylor and Brendon Todd are tied for the lead as the Mayakoba Golf Classic prepares for a Monday finish.</p>
      <p>The American pair were both sitting at 20 under through 14 holes when darkness saw play suspended in Playa del Carmen on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Heavy rain meant no play was possible at the PGA Tour event on Thursday, leading to the delayed finish.</p>
      <p>Taylor holed two birdies on his front nine before picking up shots at 10 and 13, while Todd bogeyed the 14th.</p>
      <p>A three-time winner on the PGA Tour, Taylor is eyeing his first victory since 2016, while the in-form Todd is coming off a win at the Bermuda Championship earlier this month.</p>

      <p>Mexican Carlos Ortiz has one hole left to play and is at 19 under, tied for third with Harris English, who is through 14.</p>

      <p>Adam Long – who is four under through 15 – is also within striking distance, sitting outright fifth at 18 under.</p>
