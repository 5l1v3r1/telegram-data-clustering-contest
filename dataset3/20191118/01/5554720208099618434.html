      <p>Disha Patani buying coriander leaves, Jahnvi Kapoor’s pet bottle <i>chuski </i>having an Instagram fan page and the paparazzi’s obsession with Taimur Ali Khan were the highlights of the Richa Chadha’s debut performance as a stand-up comedienne. Richa left her audience in splits as she took to stage to perform for Amazon Prime’s new series <i>One Mic Stand.</i></p>

      <p>Richa brought some funny anecdotes from her personal life and how her close relatives had reacted when they learnt that she was dating a Muslim, actor Ali Fazal. She also mentioned that she will proudly announce to the world whenever she’s pregnant with Ali Fazal’s child to make sure that the couple’s child fully benefits from the phenomenon of nepotism. In a veiled dig at Karan Johar, she said that the name of her child’s debut film will be<i> Foetus Of The Year.</i></p>
      <p>Her swipe at Karan did not stop here. She said that actors from commercially hit films made appearances on shows like <i>Koffee With Karan, </i>whereas actors from critically acclaimed films such as herself were invited to perform as a stand-up comedian on a platform such as <i>One Mic Stand </i>for free. As expected her impromptu improvisations left her audience in splits.</p>

      <p>Ali Fazal was seen blushing as he hid his face sitting in the audience after Richa mentioned him in her performance.</p>
      <p>Comedian and producer of <i>One Mic Stand,</i> Sapan Verma, performed briefly before inviting Richa to the stage. He focussed his performance on the new direction of entertainment journalism in India. Sapan said that he was tired of reading about Disha Patani buying <i>dhaniya </i>(coriander) and Janhvi Kapoor’s pet bottle <i>chuski</i> receiving more traction on social media than him. Sapan said that he expected entertainment journalists or paparazzi to inform the readers of the whereabouts of actress Rekha when she’s not taking part in award ceremonies. He wondered which sad song would singer Arijit Singh listen to when he was dealing with a break-up in his family life since others listened to sad songs sung by him in such situations.</p>
