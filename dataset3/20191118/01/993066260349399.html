      <h1>Road safety under spotlight as 15 seriously injured or killed in north each week</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T01:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 01:00</time> by <a rel="author">Mairead Holland</a></address>
      <p>FIFTEEN people are seriously injured or killed on roads in Northern Ireland every week, a charity has warned.</p>
      <p>The figure was released by Brake to mark the start of Road Safety Week.</p>
      <p>Last year, 55 people were killed and 730 seriously injured on the north's roads.</p>
      <p>The number of motorcyclists seriously injured or killed rose from 97 in 2017 to 113 in 2018.</p>
      <p>A UK-wide survey of 2,000 adults undertaken by the charity also revealed that almost half of adults in Northern Ireland have either been involved in a collision or had a near miss in the past year.</p>
      <p>Joshua Harris, director of campaigns for Brake, said people "shouldn't have to accept this level of risk" as part of their daily lives and called on the public to 'step up' and make roads safer.</p>
      <p>The charity also highlighted a campaign by family and friends of Karl Heaney (27), who was killed in a collision on the A1 between Banbridge and Dromore last year.</p>
      <p>They have already handed a petition with 12,000 signatures to the government calling for improvements to the Belfast-Dublin road.</p>
      <p>The Department for Infrastructure will this week warn of the dangers of rural roads, where two-thirds of accidents in which people are killed or seriously injured take place.</p>
      <p>Katrina Godfrey, permanent secretary of the department, said: "This week especially we are reminding all road users that rural roads may seem safe due to their lower traffic flow, but they are deadlier than we think."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, a 16-year-old boy died in Adare in Limerick when he was struck by a car in the early hours of yesterday.</p>
      <p>The fatal collision came on World Remembrance Day for Road Traffic Victims, which saw memorial services and ceremonies held across the Republic.</p>
      <p>To date in 2019, 125 people have lost their lives on the Republic's roads.</p>
