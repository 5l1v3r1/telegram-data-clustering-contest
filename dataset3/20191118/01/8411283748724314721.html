      <h1>Foxconn to serve as EV software-hardware integrator</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T01:47:28+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 01:47</time> by <a rel="author">Ninelu Tu, Taipei; Willis Ke, DIGITIMES</a></address>
      <p>Foxconn Technology Group will mainly serve as a software and hardware system integrator in the supply chain of electric vehicles (EV), which will join smart healthcare and robotics as the company's three major domains for priority development to transform itself into a provider of technology services, according to Jerry Hsiao, Foxconn's chief product officer.</p>
      <p>Hsiao, speaking at a recent seminar on smart vehicles and Internet of Vehicles (IoV) technology, said smart mobility system based on autonomous driving will become a crucial element for smart city, and both autonomous cars and EVs will see thriving development in the next 10 years.</p>
      <p>He stressed that bolstered by its sound business climate and strong technology patent portfolios, Taiwan will certainly be able to perform well in the EV sector creating much more market opportunities than desktops, notebooks, servers and smartphones.</p>
      <p>Hsiao said that the ever-advancing autonomous driving technologies will enable the global automotive electronics market to grow rapidly in the coming years, accelerate cooperation between automakers and tech firms, and prompt more tech service firms to jump on the bandwagon, eventually creating mega production value.</p>
      <p>He cited Boston Consulting Group's estimates as indicating that the global market scale for in-vehicle entertainment, auto-body electronics and ADAS systems will amount to US$150 billion in 2020, and the autonomous driving market scale will hit US$800 billion by 2030.</p>
      <p>To explore the huge market opportunities, Hsiao said, Foxconn will focus on providing a software-hardware integration platform and diverse component modules such as chassis, instead of building complete cars.</p>
      <p>Foxconn, now among suppliers of vital components for major automakers worldwide, has reportedly developed in-vehicle infotainment systems and some autonomous driving technologies in cooperation with automotive electronics clients.</p>
