      <p>Tagovailoa dislocated his right hip during Saturday’s victory over Mississippi State. The junior was carted off the field due to the season-ending injury.</p>
      <p>“For the past 24 hours our medical team has consulted with multiple orthopedic experts across the country, who specialize in hip injuries and surgeries,” Cain said in the statement. “Based on that research, Tua is being flown to Houston tonight to be evaluated and is scheduled to have hip surgery Monday.</p>
      <p>“As previously stated, we anticipate a full recovery. The main focus has been, and will remain, on Tua, his family, and making sure we are providing them the best medical care possible.”</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa passed for 2,840 yards and 33 touchdowns this season. He was intercepted three times.</p>
      <p>Overall, Tagovailoa threw for 7,442 yards with 87 touchdown passes and only 11 interceptions in 684 attempts during three college seasons.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa has been expected to declare for the NFL Draft after the season and compete to be the top pick.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa, last season’s Heisman runner-up, was injured while being sacked and slammed to the ground by two defenders. The training staff helped Tagovailoa off the field in Starkville, Miss., as the quarterback was unable to put any weight on his right side. His nose also was bleeding.</p>
      <p>“We hate it that he got injured. We hate it for him. We hate it for his family,” coach Nick Saban said after the 38-7 win. “I hate it when any player on our team gets injured. So Godspeed to him and his entire family and our thoughts and prayers are with them and hope this is not so serious it has any long-term effect on his future as a player.”</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa guided the Crimson Tide (9-1) to touchdowns on their first five drives before beginning the last possession with 3:42 remaining in the second quarter. They were leading 35-7 at the time of the injury.</p>
      <p>“We can second-guess ourselves all we want,” Saban said after the game. “We told Mac (Jones) to warm up. We were going to go two-minute before the half, and Tua wanted to go in the game. So I don’t really make a lot of decisions about guys getting hurt. ... We had total confidence in Mac, and Mac did a good job when he went in.”</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa had surgery on his ankle on Oct. 20 and returned to play in the previous week’s 46-41 loss to No. 1 LSU.</p>
