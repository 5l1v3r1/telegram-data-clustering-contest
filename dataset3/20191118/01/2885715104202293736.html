      <h1>Bank deposits: Govt share falls by nearly Rs 4 lakh crore, but corporates post sharp rise</h1>
      <h2>While the government sector accounted for as much as 13.5 per cent of the total deposits in March 2018, the share declined to 9.2 per cent in March 2019.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T01:03:30+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 01:03</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://indianexpress.com/profile/author/george-mathew/" target="_blank">George Mathew</a></address>
      <p>The government’s share in total deposits with commercial banks declined sharply from Rs 15.79 lakh crore as of March 2019 to Rs 11.86 lakh crore in March 2018, according to the latest data released by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). However, significantly, the share of corporates (non-financial) rose sharply by around Rs 6.5 lakh crore, even as the government deposits declined by Rs 3.93 lakh crore.</p>
      <p>While the government sector accounted for as much as 13.5 per cent of the total deposits in March 2018, the share declined to 9.2 per cent in March 2019.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, the share of non-financial companies jumped from Rs 11.82 lakh crore (10.1 per cent share in the total deposits) in March 2018 to Rs 18.36 lakh crore (14.24 per cent of the total deposits) in 2019, indicating a shift of over Rs 650,000 crore to non-financial companies in a year, as per the RBI data.</p>
      <p>Among institutional categories, the household sector’s share in total deposits remained dominant at 63.2 per cent, followed by non-financial corporations, general government, rest of the world and financial corporations. Individuals — including Hindu Undivided Families (HUFs) — who are the major constituent of the household sector, accounted for 55.0 per cent of aggregate deposits, the RBI said.</p>
      <p>The household sector’s deposits rose from Rs 74.11 lakh crore in 2018 to Rs 81.51 lakh crore. However, as percentage of total deposits, it remained flat at 63.21 per cent in 2019 as against 63.3 per cent last year.</p>

      <p>The share of corporates in deposits is expected to rise further in the wake of the corporate tax cut and lack of new investments amid the ongoing slowdown in the economy, analysts said.</p>
      <p>According to the RBI, the share of current, savings and term deposits stood at 9.6 per cent, 31.9 per cent and 58.5 per cent, respectively, in March 2019.</p>
      <p>Metropolitan areas held 51.8 per cent of bank deposits. Since March 2010, however, the shares of other population groups have gradually risen, with 10.5 per cent share for rural areas, 16.2 per cent for semi-urban areas and 21.5 per cent for urban areas by March 2019, the RBI said.</p>
      <p>With the RBI lowering interest rates, the structure of term deposits has gradually shifted to lower interest rate buckets in recent years, with the share of term deposits with interest rates above 8 per cent declining from 82.8 per cent in March 2015 to 10.9 per cent in March 2019. The central bank has cut the repo rate by 125 basis points between March 2015 and March 2019.</p>
      <p>“The share would have gone down further as the RBI has cut repo rate by another 110 points to 5.15 per cent between March 2019 and October 2019. Banks have also shifted to repo-linked deposit rates since October this year,” said an official of a nationalised bank. Banks also slashed deposit rates faster than the lending rates.</p>
      <p>The RBI has nearly three-fourths of term deposits which were due for maturity within one year on residual maturity basis. On original maturity basis, however, 58.3 per cent of term deposits were in the one to three years maturity bucket at the end of March 2019. About half of the deposits of financial and non-financial corporations were held with private sector banks.</p>
      <p>Among states, Maharashtra held the highest share of deposits (21.0 per cent), followed by National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi (9.5 per cent) and Uttar Pradesh (8.2 per cent). However, bankers said this is because of the large number of corporate houses based in Mumbai. The commercial capital also accounts for the largest number of bank branches and headquarters of banks.</p>
