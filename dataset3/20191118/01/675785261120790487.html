      <h2>Prince Andrew originally refused to talk about his paedophile friend although he agreed to the car crash BBC Newsnight interview following the financier's arrest and subsequent suicide</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T01:42:29+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 01:42</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Dresch, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matthew-dresch/</a></address>
      <p>BBC Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis believes the Queen gave Prince Andrew permission to talk about his paedophile friend Jeffrey Epstein, despite a report suggesting otherwise.</p>
      <p>Ms Maitlis said the Duke of York told Newsnight he needed to 'seek approval from higher up' after the team told him they would ask him about the disgraced financier in their interview.</p>
      <p>She added that on Tuesday last week the BBC received a message telling them to call the Duke's office, suggesting the Queen had granted approval for the sit down conversation.</p>
      <p>Ms Maitlis goes into detail the behind-the-scenes negotiations that led to the bombshell in a piece she wrote for The <a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/emily-maitlis-my-interview-with-prince-andrew-8hhclpwcf">Times</a> today.</p>

      <p>She wrote: "We propose a 40-minute extended interview — with a set-up piece to explain the background of all that had been said. We have finished laying out our pitch. An awkward moment of silence falls.</p>
      <p>"And the Duke tells us he must 'seek approval from higher up'. It dawns on us then that he means the Queen herself.</p>
      <p>"At 8am the next day we have a message telling us to call his office. The Queen, it seems, is on board."</p>
      <p>While not definitive proof, the presenter's account would appear to contradict a report in todays Daily Telegraph, which has a source saying Her Majesty did not give her blessing for the Newsnight interview.</p>

      <p>The source says: "The statement Buckingham Palace issued said the Queen was aware of the interview but not that she approved it.</p>
      <p>"It does seem as if the Duke of York's private office is operating in silo, which is really quite dangerous because there is a lack of accountability there.</p>
      <p>"Internally, this is being seen as a f*** up."</p>
      <p>In her piece, Ms Maitlis says Newsnight originally proposed an interview with the Duke around a year ago, although when the Palace showed an interest in May it insisted on blocking any questions about Epstein.</p>

      <p>The BBC would not agree to the constraint and the interview did not go ahead.</p>
      <p>However, pressure mounted on the Duke to address his friendship with Epstein after the billionaire financier was arrested on sex trafficking charges in July and killed himself in prison in August.</p>
      <p>One of Epstein's victims, Virginia Roberts - now Giuffre, claimed she had been trafficked to have sex with Prince Andrew three times.</p>
      <p>She said she had sex with the royal when she was 17-years-old.</p>
      <p>Mrs Maitlis said: "The Palace knew they had a problem. They had sent out statements vigorously denying the claims. But those perhaps lacked the conviction of a human voice behind them."</p>
      <p>The Prince categorically denied having sex with Mrs Giuffre and said he could not even remember meeting her. </p>
      <p>He also denied recalling the infamous picture of him and Mrs Giuffre cosying up to each other being taken, suggesting it could be a fake.</p>

      <p>Mrs Maitlis encountered further evidence of the royal family's distaste for the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/netflix">Netflix</a> hit show The Crown at the end of her 'surreal' experience interviewing the Prince.</p>
      <p>The interviewer said that as she left Buckingham Palace a worker invited her to a screening of Judy at the royal household.</p>
      <p>When she told the employee that they could show the new series of The Crown on Sunday, they replied 'We had Downton Abbey last week. But we don’t do The Crown here'.</p>
