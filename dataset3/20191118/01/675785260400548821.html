      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T01:49:59+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 01:49</time> by <a rel="author">Sam Elliott, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/sam-elliott/</a></address>
      <p>War has broken out between axed <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/strictlys-michelle-visage-reportedly-deeply-20870446">Michelle Visage</a> and former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a> star James Jordan.</p>
      <p>The pair have gone in on each other on twitter after she became the the eighth celebrity to leave the show.</p>
      <p>James alleges the Drag Race star only performed to iconic Madonna hit Vogue to win 'the LGBT vote'.</p>
      <p>He then called out her 'fake tears' before the 51-year-old hit back.</p>
      <p>She tweeted: "That's deplorable. Gross" after being directed to his post - before telling him: "Also James, you should @ people when you talk about them! That's all."</p>

      <p>He then claimed she was trolling him after saying the American was "boring!!!".</p>
      <p>James said her choice backfired, adding: "Not for me sorry... not dancing, just posing. Obviously needs the LGBTQIA community's vote".</p>
      <p>The dancer then put it was an "EASY EASY decision" to get rid of the her.</p>
      <p>She later responded: "The only way to change the world is by taking risks. I'm SOOOOOO proud of this dance and going out on this one."</p>
      <p>James hit back, saying: "I love the fact I’m being trolled by <a href="https://twitter.com/michellevisage">@michellevisage</a> for my honest opinions on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> and never once “@“ her in any tweet Didn’t realise I wasn’t allowed my own opinion on my own account.</p>

      <p>"Think she’s still upset “her” community didn’t save her. Don’t blame me."</p>
      <p>Fans were split on twitter.</p>
      <p>"I like u James but sometimes you don't help yourself, yes have an opinion but when you write stuff like "her community" etc your obviously gunna get people's backs up" one wrote.</p>

      <p>Another put: "You're right, correct decision for her to leave."</p>
      <p>But one said: "Stop attention seeking James."</p>
      <p>While another posted: "You got fired from the show and wouldn't qualify to be a celebrity enough to be on it."</p>
