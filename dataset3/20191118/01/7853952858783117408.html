      <p>North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un supervised air force drills for the second time in three days, state media reported on Monday, even as the United States and South Korea decided to postpone their joint air exercises.</p>
      <p>According to Pyongyang’s official KCNA news agency, Kim supervised an airborne landing training of sharpshooter sub-units of the Air and Anti-Aircraft Force of the North Korean army, Reuters reports.</p>
      <p>Kim “said that it is necessary to wage a drill without notice under the simulated conditions of real war” for “improving the preparedness” of North Korean military units, KCNA said.</p>
      <p>Earlier, on Saturday, KCNA had reported that Kim watched a “combat flight contest” of the flight commanding officers of the Air and Anti-Aircraft Force. A photo in state newspaper Rodong Sinmun showed him smiling amid pilots gathered around him.</p>
      <p>It was unclear when Kim oversaw these events, or whether it was on the same day, Reuters noted. </p>
      <p>The announcements came even as the US and South Korea said on Sunday that they will postpone upcoming military drills, known as the Combined Flying Training Event, in an effort to bolster stalled peace push with North Korea.</p>
      <p>Thee drills, already planned to be scaled back from previous years, would have simulated air combat scenarios and involved an undisclosed number of warplanes from both the US and South Korea to test readiness.</p>
