      <h1>OnePlus Launcher Magisk mod enables Google Feed on any OnePlus device</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T01:22:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 01:22</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/author/pranobmehrotra/" target="_blank">Pranob Mehrotra</a></address>
      <p>OnePlus’ <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tag/oxygenos/">OxygenOS</a> is a fine example of an Android skin done right. It offers you a stock Android-like experience, while still featuring plenty of customization options. Even the stock apps included on the devices follow this trend, including the OnePlus Launcher. However, its Shelf feature, which lies to the left of the home screen, isn’t as well-liked as the Google Feed on stock Android devices. Even though OnePlus continues to <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/oneplus-launcher-4-1-0-prepares-courier-tracking-card/">add features</a> to it, many users still prefer the Google Feed and they have to rely on third-party launchers to enable it on their devices.</p>
      <p>Last year, <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/oneplus-launcher-oneplus-6-google-feed/">it was discovered</a> that the OnePlus Launcher has a hidden toggle to enable Google Feed integration. Subsequently, a modder enabled the toggle and shared his <a href="https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk">Magisk</a> Module with the community. Shortly thereafter, it was discovered that the T-mobile version of the OnePlus 6T comes with the Google Feed integration enabled by default. And ever since then, T-Mobile versions of OnePlus devices have had Google Feed integration by default. Sadly though, the international and India/China models of the devices still only offered OnePlus Shelf integration in the stock launcher. Now, a new modded version of the OnePlus Launcher has been released which enables the Google Feed integration on any OnePlus device.</p>

      <p>As you can see in the screenshots above, the modded launcher replaces Shelf with the Google Feed, without requiring you to install a third-party launcher. You can download the Magisk Module from the link down below and enable the Google Feed on your device right away. But in order for it to work, you’ll first need to root your device and install Magisk. This is because the original OnePlus Launcher had to be modified to enable the feature and you can’t install a modded APK on top of the original APK.</p>
