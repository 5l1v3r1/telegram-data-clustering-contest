      <p>Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa shared a heartfelt message for his Crimson Tide teammates on Instagram tonight. The star QB was visited by some of his teammates in the hospital today.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa, who’s out for the rest of the season with a hip injury, was visited by several of his teammates earlier this afternoon.</p>
      <p>“OHANA means FAMILY, and FAMILY means no one gets left behind..” he wrote.</p>
      <p>Alabama wide receiver Henry Ruggs responded:</p>
      <p>“Or forgotten.”</p>

      <p>Alabama announced earlier this evening that Tagovailoa will be undergoing surgery on Monday.</p>
      <p>“For the past 24 hours our medical team has consulted with multiple orthopedic experts across the country, who specialize in hip injuries and surgeries. Based on that research, Tua is being flown to Houston tonight to be evaluated and is scheduled to have hip surgery Monday,” team orthopedic surgeon Lyle Cain said.</p>

      <p>“As previously stated, we anticipate a full recovery. The main focus has been, and will remain, on Tua, his family, and making sure we are providing them the best medical care possible.”</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa was injured at the end of the first half against Mississippi State on Saturday afternoon. Alabama was leading, 35-7, at the time of the injury. Nick Saban said he was still in the game to get some two-minute drill practice.</p>
