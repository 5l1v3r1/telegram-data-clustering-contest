      <h1>You Can Rent This Official Rick and Morty-Themed Car</h1>
      <h2>But you can't get inside the microverse battery.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T01:00:53+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 01:00</time> by <a rel="author">Ian Wright</a></address>
      <p>There are three types of people in this world. People that watch Adult Swim's 'Rick and Morty,' people that don't watch it, and people that don't think the world can be divided in half. Those in the first third now have the opportunity to show their love of the adult-themed cartoon by driving around in a <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/mazda/mazda-3-hatchback">Mazda3</a> equipped with a giant version of Morty Smith on the roof.</p>
      <p>The genuinely bizarre Mortymobile is available to rent <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/this-couple-funded-their-160-000-tesla-purchases-by-renting-them-out">via the car-sharing service Turo</a> in conjunction with Adult Swim, for $350 per day. But unlike Rick's car in the show, the Mortymobile was not made from stuff in the garage and can not fly through space.</p>

      <p>That $350 a day sounds expensive, but, as we know, the universe is a little too big to care about something so small. It would also be worth it just to see the look on people's faces around town as they see a giant and terrified Morty holding on to the roof for dear life.</p>
      <p>The Mortymobile just got its official unveiling at the Adult Swim Festival in California this weekend. It will then be available to rent from November 18-25 in Los Angeles, then in San Diego from December 9-16. After that, it goes on a nationwide tour to celebrate season four of Rick and Morty, which is currently airing on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim.</p>

      <p>More cities and dates have been slated for the Mortymobile's availability through 2020, and according to the press release, all proceeds from the Mortymobile Tour will be donated to an organization that supports and empowers women in technical fields.</p>
      <p>The car is billed as being: "Painstakingly designed and hand-crafted using the finest fiberglass available in this dimension, the larger-than-life Morty is fixed atop a 5-door hatchback that boasts a 2.5L four-cylinder engine with 167 horsepower, a four-speaker audio system for bumping the planet-rescuing slapper, 'Get Schwifty,' and power windows, so you can feel that brisk November breeze on your face."</p>
