      <p>Musician and businessman Jay-Z <a href="https://sputniknews.com/viral/201908191076582788-cardi-b-breaks-twitter-by-saying-jay-z-has-the-power-to-bring-colin-kaepernick-back-to-nfl/">has expressed his distaste</a> for Colin Kaepernick and the way he aired his workout on Saturday, with anonymous sources telling TMZ that he said Kaepernick "turned a legitimate workout into a publicity stunt".</p>
      <p>Sources, who are reportedly close to Jay-Z, told TMZ that he does not approve of the manner of the workout, as he feels that the NFL was legitimately attempting to offer Colin an opportunity to make a comeback.</p>
