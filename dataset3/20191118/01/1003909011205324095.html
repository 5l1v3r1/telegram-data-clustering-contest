      <p>WestJet Airlines has formed a new partnership aimed at helping to grow Canada’s Indigenous tourism sector, a move that could lead to the airline selling authentic cultural tourism packages to Europeans and other international visitors.</p>
      <p>The Calgary-based airline announced earlier this week that it has signed a three-year, $100,000 deal with the <a href="https://indigenoustourism.ca/en/">Indigenous Tourism Association of Canada</a> (ITAC), an Indigenous-led non-profit organization that markets travel experiences and tours offered by Indigenous peoples, communities and businesses across the country.</p>
      <p>The deal will see WestJet collaborate with ITAC on marketing materials and videos that will highlight Canada’s Indigenous cultures and communities in the WestJet magazine and on the airline’s inflight entertainment system.</p>
      <p>WestJet will also work with ITAC to help existing Indigenous-led tourism businesses enhance and develop their products — with an international visitor in mind.</p>
      <p>“If you think of WestJet Vacations, right now it’s focused on Canadians going down south,” said Arved von zur Muehlen, WestJet’s chief commercial officer. “But we also want to bring more guests into Canada. So the Indigenous product that we define and that we feel is export-ready, we will even be able to sell on our own platform in the future.”</p>
      <p>WestJet has been quietly working to increase connections with Indigenous communities since the airline’s new CEO, Ed Sims, took over in 2018. When the airline took possession of its first Boeing 787 Dreamliner last winter, southern Alberta Indigenous leaders were invited to WestJet’s Calgary headquarters to formally bless the aircraft. Indigenous leaders were also part of a ceremony to mark the completion of WestJet’s new, $50-million hangar to house the Dreamliner.</p>
      <p>In May, WestJet partnered with Destination Canada and ITAC to fly Indigenous leaders and tourism representatives to London, U.K., for an Indigenous tourism showcase. The airline has been expanding internationally thanks to the longer range of the Dreamliner — in addition to London, it also offers flights to Paris, Dublin and Rome.</p>
      <p>“There are a lot of good markets (in Europe) that have interest in Indigenous tourism products,” von zur Muehlen said. “The trade show in London basically confirmed that . . . we had a very good response.”</p>
      <p>On its website, ITAC already markets a number of <a href="https://indigenouscanada.travel/">vacation packages</a> involving Indigenous destinations and experiences, including a wildlife tour in Nunavik, an art and culture immersion in Haida Gwaii, B.C., and a southern Alberta getaway that includes visits to Blackfoot Crossing Historical Park and the Royal Tyrrell Museum.</p>
      <p>However, ITAC president and CEO Keith Henry said there is much more that could be done, adding the organization’s own survey data suggests one in three international visitors are interested in adding an Indigenous experience to their Canadian vacation. The numbers are even higher among visitors from France (63 per cent) and Germany (47 per cent).</p>

      <p>“The challenge we’ve got is, we have really high demand but we don’t have enough supply,” Henry said. “Although we’ve got 1,900 Indigenous-owned tourism businesses in Canada, we’ve only got about 140 or so that are truly what we call ‘international export ready.’ ”</p>
      <p>According to ITAC’s recently updated five-year plan, the organization has set the goal of increasing Indigenous tourism revenues in Canada from $1.4 billion in 2015 to $2.2 billion by 2024. Henry said the partnership with WestJet is incredibly important, both for what it wants to achieve and also for the symbolic boost it gives Indigenous communities.</p>
      <p>“Indigenous tourism businesses don’t always feel like they’re part of the mainstream industry. And, typically, when we develop Indigenous tourism in Canada, it’s often politically led,” Henry said. “But this is purely business and private-sector focused . . . It gives them (Indigenous tourism operators) an extra feeling of confidence that the industry stands with us.”</p>
