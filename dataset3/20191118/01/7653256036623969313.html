      <p>NEW DELHI: Indian <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/henna">henna</a> powder, chillies, value-added tea and moringa (drumstick) powder have caught the fancy of the country’s second largest trading partner <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/China">China</a> and the Asian giant is keen to import these agricultural products from <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/India">India</a>.</p>
      <p>Chinese importers raised inquiries about these value-added farm products at the recently concluded import-only fair in Shanghai.</p>
      <p>A Tamil Nadu-based exporter of henna powder booked orders above Rs 3 crore at the second edition of the China International Import Expo in Shanghai which took place from November 5-10.</p>
      <p>“There were a lot of enquiries about agricultural products, especially <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/drumsticks">drumsticks</a> powder for herbal uses, chilies and value-added tea such as tea sticks. We placed orders worth a few million dollars,” said an official aware of the details.</p>
      <p>India exported around $200 million of these products in the April-September period of 2019-20.</p>
      <p>The import only expo is aimed to reduce China’s burgeoning trade deficit with its major trading partners. It expects to import products and services valuing more than $10 trillion through such fairs.</p>
      <p>India’s exports to China in the first six months of 2019-20 were $8.5 billion while imports were $36.3 billion. The trade deficit was $53.6 billion in FY19.</p>
      <p>“They want us to provide organic certification for such agricultural goods because demand for organic products is huge there,” the official added.</p>
      <p>The main product categories in the expo were sci-tech life, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment &amp; healthcare products, automobile, equipment, quality life, trade in services, food and agriculture products.</p>
      <p>Besides, joint ventures with Indian companies in areas such as scanners and low end engineering products including hand tools were also discussed.</p>
      <p>“Many companies are interested to use India as their export base and also cater to the Indian market. They have an incentive of lower corporate tax rate here,” said Ajay Sahai, director general, Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO).</p>
      <p>The growth in India’s exports to China has been driven by marine products, organic chemicals, plastics, petroleum products, grapes and rice. India’s exports of marine products to China has tripled and touched almost $800 million in the first nine months of 2019 and are expected to cross $1 billion mark by the end of this calendar year.</p>
