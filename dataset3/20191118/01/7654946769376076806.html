      <h1>Congestion fee panel can meet in secret, MTA brass claims</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T01:54:51+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 01:54</time> by <a rel="author">Carl Campanile</a></address>
      <p>Despite calls for transparency in its <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/15/reform-groups-demand-congestion-pricing-board-comply-with-open-meetings-law/">formation of Manhattan’s congestion-pricing plan</a>, the MTA claims the powerful committee that will propose the tolls is not covered under the state’s Open Meetings Law — and can operate in secret.</p>
      <p>The state-controlled transit authority has yet to name the members of the Traffic Mobility Review Board, which will study tolling levels and make recommendations.</p>
      <p>“The TMRB is tasked only with making recommendations and it doesn’t perform a governmental action subject to the open meetings law,” claimed MTA spokeswoman Abbey Collins.</p>
      <p>She promised that “once constituted the TMRB will determine a public engagement process, which we believe is critically important.”</p>
      <p>Officials hope the tolling program will pay for $15 billion of the $51.5 billion the MTA says it needs to improve subways, buses and commuter railroads.</p>
      <p>Drivers will be charged a yet-to-be-determined toll to enter the new congestion zone, which will cover Manhattan south of 60th Street.</p>
      <p>A coalition of 20 transit watchdog groups on Friday demanded the MTA swiftly appoint the toll board, and argued it should be required to follow state transparency laws.</p>
      <p>Those groups immediately took issue with the MTA’s legal position Sunday.</p>
      <p>“These recommendations will affect millions of people. Sunshine is the best way to have these conversations,” said Lisa Daglian of the Permanent Advisory Committee to the MTA.</p>
      <p>Good government groups said there is a precedent for their push, pointing out that the state’s Committee on Open Government ruled another MTA panel — the Sustainability Advisory Workgroup — was subject to the Open Meetings Law.</p>
      <p>“The same standard would seem to apply in this case, particularly around votes to approve any recommendations,” said Reinvent Albany’s Rachael Fauss.</p>
      <p>She said the coalition will request a formal opinion from the state Committee on Open Government if the MTA refuses to be budge.</p>
      <p>State lawmakers legally prohibited the MTA’s congestion pricing toll board from releasing its pricing recommendations until after the 2020 election to avoid a possible backlash from outer-borough and suburban drivers at the ballot box.</p>
      <p><a href="https://nypost.com/2019/04/02/politicians-put-off-setting-congestion-pricing-fee-until-after-2020-election/">The Post broke the story in April</a> exposing the provision, which bars the panel from producing its report until 12 days after the Nov. 3, 2020, election.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the six appointed TMRB members will have the power to establish hardship exemptions from the toll and allow for bridge and tunnel tolls to be rebated.</p>
      <p>One representative will be drawn from the Long Island Railroad and MetroNorth territories and a second will be appointed by the mayor.</p>
      <p>The rest of the members will be appointed by the MTA’s Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, which oversees the East River bridges and tunnels.</p>
