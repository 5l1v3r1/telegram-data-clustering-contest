      <h1>Kanye Announces His First Opera, <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i></h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T01:11:56+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 01:11</time> by <a rel="author">Halle Kiefer</a></address>
      <p>Fire up those furnaces and tidy up your lion’s den: <a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/kanye-west/">Kanye</a> is moving into the opera stage of his musical career and, like much of <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/10/kanye-west-jesus-is-king-album-review.html">his recent output</a>, he is drawing inspiration from the Bible. West <a href="https://pitchfork.com/news/kanye-announces-nebuchadnezzar-opera/">posted an invite</a> to <i>Nebuchadnezzar: A Kanye West Opera </i>to Twitter on Sunday. The show will be directed by <a href="https://www.thecut.com/2016/08/vanessa-beecroft-bodies-artist.html">many-time Kanye collaborator</a> and performance artist Vanessa Beecroft, with music by Yeezy’s Sunday Service collective, Peter Collins, and Infinities Song. For you lucky Angelenos, <i>Nebuchadnezzar </i>premieres at the Hollywood Bowl on November 24. Tickets go on sale Monday.</p>
      <p>For those fans who didn’t study the Book of Daniel growing up, Nebuchadnezzar is a king of Babylon who famously threw three Hebrew men named Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego into a fiery furnace, from which God then protected them. Nebuchadnezzar also invaded Jerusalem, had his dreams interpreted by Daniel, and went mad for seven years, among other misadventures proving the power of God. So overall, a lot to work with, opera-wise. </p>
      <p>The announcement arrived just hours after Kanye visited famed televangelist <a href="https://www.vulture.com/news/joel-osteen/">Joel Osteen</a> at his Houston, Texas, megachurch and discussed his recent recommitment to Christianity at length. “I know that God’s been calling me for a long time and the devil’s been distracting me for a long time,” West <a href="https://people.com/music/kanye-west-calls-himself-greatest-artist-that-god-has-ever-created/">said in part</a>. “Jesus has won the victory. I told you about my arrogance and cockiness already. Now the greatest artist that God has ever created is now working for him.” You can stream Kanye’s musical appearance at Osteen’s Lakewood Church <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXwHM96rbyM&amp;feature=youtu.be">here</a>.</p>
