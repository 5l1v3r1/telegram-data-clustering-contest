      <h1>Colin Kaepernick’s Agent Has Reportedly Heard Nothing About Possible Contract After Workout (VIDEO)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T01:14:58+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 01:14</time> by <a rel="author">Darrelle Lincoln</a></address>
      <p>It looks like the NFL without Colin Kaepernick just might continue that way for the forseeable future.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, controversy started over the venue not allowing cameras in to document what Colin Kaepernick would be doing on this day in front of 25 teams, so Kaepernick’s team moved the venue to a high school that was an hour away.</p>
      <p>Only eight teams showed up the workout.</p>
      <p>Following an impressive showing, Kaepernick had a lot to say to owners as well as Roger Goodell that rubbed people the wrong way, and he might be paying for it now.</p>
      <p>Just before Sunday Night Football, Mike Florio of PFT stated Kaepernick’s agent hadn’t heard from any team about a possible private workout nor a possible contract. Nothing has changed.</p>
