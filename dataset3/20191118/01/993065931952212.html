      <h1>Aidan Walsh aiming for a hat-trick of Elite victories on the trot</h1>

      <p>ANTRIM welter Aidan Walsh will be aiming for his third victory in four days in the last four of the Liffey Crane National Elite Championships at Dublin's National Stadium tonight.</p>
      <p>The Monkstown BC stylist, who beat Dublin's Terry McEntee 4-1 last Friday, beat Galway's Kieran Molloy 4-1 24 hours later to book his ticket into tonight's semi-final against Ryan O'Rourke of the St Michael’s BC in Dublin.</p>
      <p>It all added up to 4-1 for Walsh over the weekend, as Molloy, the defending champion who was aiming for three in a row, took the first round on four of the five cards, but the 2018 Commonwealth finalist nailed rounds two and three 4-1 to post a 29-28, 29-28, 30-27, 29-28, 28-29 verdict.</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately, it didn't happen for us on Saturday night,” admitted Molloy's coach and dad Stephen Molloy, who expressed confidence that his son will bounce straight back from the reversal.</p>
      <p>There was injury heartbreak for rising Ulster 81kg fighter Kane Tucker.</p>
      <p>The Emerald star fractured his wrist during Friday night’s win over David Biscevis (St Saviours OBA).</p>
      <p>“Unfortunately, Kane had to withdraw from the Irish elites on Saturday night, ‘’ said his coach Harry Hawkins.</p>
      <p>“He sustained a scaphoid fracture to his right wrist in his unanimous win in the Stadium the night before. It’s a bad blow, but knowing how dedicated Kane is, I’m confident he’ll bounce back from it.’’ </p>
      <p>Cork southpaw Callum Walsh and Drogheda’s Eugene McKeever, who toppled Luke McGuire and Michael Bustard on Saturday, clash in the corresponding 69kg semi-final this evening.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, Tyrone’s Jude Gallagher impressed en route to a unanimous decision over Sean Kavanagh on his Elite debut. The Two Castles BC flyweight is in against defending champion Adam Hession this evening.</p>
      <p>“I felt I boxed very well and controlled the fight comfortably, especially for my first Elite fight. That was my Elite debut and also my first fight without a head guard,” said Clancy.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Olympic champion Michael Carruth reckons that defending feather champion Patryk Adamus will only get better.</p>
      <p>The Drimnagh BC battler edged Laois’ Christian Cekiso on a 3-2 split on Saturday in a repeat of last February’s final, which the Dubliner, who renews acquaintances with Limerick’s Tommy Casey tonight, also won 3-2.</p>
      <p>“There’s tough lads there. We’re taking it one fight at a time, the old cliche. He (Adamus) reminds me of me sometimes. I always say that the toughest fight in any Championships is your first fight,'' said Carruth, who is working Adamus' corner.</p>
      <p>“I mean Olympics, Worlds, Nationals, it’s your first fight that's always the toughest because you’re questioning yourself, “am I fit enough, am I sharp enough, have I done enough work?”</p>
      <p>"We obviously boxed that lad (Cekiso) in the final and he’s a good kid, he has all the merits. We knew we were in for a tough fight. It was always going to be close between Paddy and him."</p>
      <p>Fifteen semi-finals will be decided tonight including the outstanding quarter-final featuring Caitlin Fryers of the Immaculata BC and Kildare’s Niamh Early. Carly McNaul (Holy Family BC) anticipates the winner on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>The finals will be decided on Friday night at the National Stadium. Defending champion Michaela Walsh, Aiden's sister, awaits the victor from Wednesday last-four clash between Emma Agnew and Dearbhla Rooney for the 57kg title.</p>
      <p>The IABA is running the Elites twice this year in the run-up to the European qualifiers for Tokyo 2020 at the Copper Box in London next March. Seventy-seven places – 50 for men and 27 for women – will be up for grabs across the 13 weight classes in both genders.</p>
      <p>There will be one final world qualifier in Paris next May. The exact amount of places available in the French capital is contingent on which weights Japan takes its six – 4 for men and 2 for women – invitation places in.</p>
