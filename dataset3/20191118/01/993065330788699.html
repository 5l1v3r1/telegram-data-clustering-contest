      <p>I HAD an amazing holiday in southern Spain this summer, where I met an English guy who was working over there. He told me he was 22, and although I'm 17 that didn't seem like too huge a gap, as we got on so well. We spent most of our time together when I was there and really hit it off, big time.</p>
      <p>On the last day of my holiday though, he told me he was married, which was a real shock. He also told me he was 27, and that he'd only lied about his age because he didn't want me to think the age-gap was too big. He said he and his wife hadn't been happy for some time, but that he really liked me and wanted to stay in touch. I was still shocked, but I like him so much that I agreed.</p>
      <p>Since I've been home, he's messaged me regularly and we've chatted on FaceTime, which has made me still feel close to him. Then last week, when I answered the phone, it wasn't him – it was his wife. She broke down and cried when she saw me and said that because of me, her husband was planning to leave her. I was so shocked, I rang off, put my phone down and walked away.</p>
      <p>It rang again right away and my mother answered it, so this woman told my mum everything.</p>
      <p>Now my parents are furious with me and I feel scared as well as so guilty, as it seems she lives in Spain too and he'd told her he was working late when he was with me. I haven't answered his calls since, but he's texted me and told me he's sorry and that he loves me. I just don't know what to do.</p>

      <p><b>FIONA SAYS:</b> Even though your parents are furious with you, this is not your fault. A man that you liked and trusted has lied to you. He's also lied to and deceived his wife, so please don't try and shoulder the blame for the break-up of his marriage. That is entirely down to him – although I suspect there were problems in his relationship before you came on the scene anyway.</p>
      <p>You didn't set out to 'trap' a married man and break up his relationship – you're just as much a victim here as his wife is. He should never have involved you in this unpleasantness, but now you are involved you must decide what is best for you, regardless of anyone else's point of view.</p>
      <p>If you really care for this man then you will, presumably, want to stay in touch with him, and will presumably hope to form an ongoing relationship with him.</p>
      <p>I would caution you though to be very careful, because he's lied to you about his age and his status, he's lied to his wife, and so deception is something he finds quite easy. It's quite possible that a man who's done that once could do it again – and the next time, you could be the victim.</p>
      <p>If you decide he's worth the risk, then you're going to have to build bridges with your parents. Talk to them and make it clear to them that this situation is not of your making but now you're in it, you'd appreciate their understanding and support. I suspect they are not going to look on this man favourably for some time and he's going to need to prove himself to them.</p>
      <p>If, however, you decide he's not worth the risk - and it seems like a big risk to me - then your solution is simple. Tell him you don't wish to have any further involvement with him, and then don't answer his calls, delete his texts, and even consider changing your number.</p>
      <p>Almost everyone will have had a wild holiday romance in their time - probably even your parents. It might be safest to put this one down to experience and move on with your life without him.</p>

        <b>I'M DREADING MY COUSIN VISITING AGAIN</b>
      </p>
      <p>MY MUM'S brother lives in America and has two sons – my cousins. The elder one, who is 19, came over to stay with us last year for a couple of weeks and he made my life miserable, as whenever he got me alone, he was always groping and pawing at me.</p>
      <p>I didn't want to say anything to my mum about it because I didn't want to cause a problem, but now he's coming over to stay again for even longer. She and my dad are really looking forward to seeing him again but I'm afraid he's going to be the same as he was last time.</p>
      <p>Should I tell her? I'm 14 and I'm really not sure how to deal with this.</p>
      <p>

      <p><b>FIONA SAYS:</b> Your cousin's behaviour is appalling, and you shouldn't feel the slightest need to protect him. You have nothing to be ashamed of – whereas he most certainly does.</p>
      <p>You're worried about upsetting your mum, but I expect your dad would be furious if he knew what had happened and certainly wouldn't want this young man in the house again. I think you really must speak to at least one of your parents and explain exactly what happened last time. You might find it easier to have this conversation with your father rather than your mother, but you do need to speak to one – if not both of them. Explain that you didn't want to make a fuss at the time but just don't want to risk it happening again.</p>
      <p>It's possible that whichever parent you speak to, they may want to keep it from the other to avoid a family confrontation, but whatever happens, you should be protected from your cousin.</p>
      <p>I suspect they won't want him in the house again but if that's not possible, perhaps you could be away when he's there. If you find it difficult to approach your parents about this, you could contact Childline on 0800 1111 and talk things through with a counsellor.</p>

        <b>I'VE FALLEN IN LOVE WITH MY GAY BEST FRIEND</b>
      </p>
      <p>I'M SURE you'll think this is foolish, but I've fallen in love with a wonderful man who is kind, sensitive, understanding, my best friend – and gay. I can talk to him more easily than I can anyone else, and we've even talked about how I feel about him, which, he says, is sad and that he's sorry. I realise there is no chance of a sexual relationship developing with him, but on another level, I can't help but hope he'll feel differently. Whatever happens, I want to keep him as a friend, but I feel I'd like to understand him better.</p>
      <p>
        <b>YP</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>FIONA SAYS:</b> You say you want to understand him better but – and forgive me if I've misunderstood you – it sounds like you want to find a website or read a book about homosexuality in order to change him. If you want to understand him, then talking to him is going to be a much sounder basis on which to develop and maintain a friendship than anything you could read.</p>
      <p>Friendship is about shared interests and attitudes, and his outlook on life and how that fits with yours is a much better basis for a friendship than his sexual orientation. Talk to him – just like you would any other friend.</p>
      <p>You may love him – he may love you – but this isn't ever going to be a sexual relationship, not if he's gay, so stop hoping. He's explained that and is still willing to try and keep your friendship going. If you try and change him though, you'll just drive him away.</p>

        <b>MENOPAUSE HAS DAMAGED MY SEX LIFE</b>
      </p>
      <p>Since my doctor put me on HRT, I have to say that things with my husband have got worse, not better. Because of all the symptoms I had, I've not really been interested in a sexual relationship for some time.</p>
      <p>Now I am but it seems he isn't. He seems to avoid coming to bed until he thinks I'm asleep and if I say anything or express any interest, he gets grumpy. Do you think he could be having an affair?</p>
      <p>
        <b>JM</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>FIONA SAYS:</b> It is always possible that he's having an affair, but it's equally possible that, if your relationship has been 'dormant' for some time, he may be anxious about restarting things. He may well have become used to taking the initiative where sex was concerned, especially if you weren't really interested. He may fear that now you want to take the initiative, you will no longer be satisfied with his performance. His excuses and avoidance tactics are clear indicators of anxiety rather than an affair.</p>
      <p>Perhaps take some time away together – nothing as obvious and unsubtle (at this stage) as a weekend in Paris, but rather a cosy pub where you can go out for long walks together. Then you can come back to reassuring cuddles in front of the fire that will, hopefully, rebuild the intimacy between you.</p>
      <p>Try to get him to see that your renewed interest in a physical relationship with him can be a positive thing for you both. It may well be that he's worried about impotence too, so if you can get him to talk about it, a visit to the doctor for medication could help.</p>
