      <p>CAIRO (AP) — A leading human rights group says the deadly crackdown in Sudan against pro-democracy protesters in June may have amounted to a crime against humanity.</p>
      <p>Human Rights Watch said on Monday that Sudan’s military rulers at the time planned the violent dispersal of a sit-in in the capital, Khartoum. The sit-in was the cornerstone in the uprising that led to the military’s overthrow of autocratic President Omar al-Bashir in April.</p>
      <p>HRW is urging Sudan’s new transitional government to undertake an “independent and transparent” investigation of those violations.</p>
      <p>The protest movement says at least 128 people were killed in the crackdown. The death toll provided by authorities at the time was 87, including 17 at the sit-in.</p>
      <p>Sudanese prosecutors in a July investigation said some within the security forces had exceeded orders.</p>
