      <h4>Our rating</h4>
      <p>4 out of 5</p>
      <h3>THE PLACE</h3>
      <p>Towering over the warm waters of the Persian Gulf, Atlantis, The Palm sits atop the reclaimed land of "The Palm", or Palm Jumeirah, the world's biggest man-made island whose fronds contain the houses of wealthy Emeratis, shopping malls and apartment complexes. From a drone's-eye view, Palm Jumeirah looks a bit like a palm-shaped rubber stamp and this mega-resort is right at the top of this improbable island, accessed via a tunnel under the sea.</p>
      <h3>THE LOCATION</h3>
      <p>Palm Jumeirah is on the coast of Dubai, a Singapore-on-Sand where unfeasibly large buildings have sprouted from the unforgiving desert in much the same way that the Lion City has spun swamp into concrete and metal. It is a dreamlike drive to the Palm, past museums shaped like Arabic script, the silver stalagmite of the Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building, and mega-malls and American fast food shops for miles.</p>
      <h3>THE SPACE</h3>
      <p>There is no doubt that Atlantis, The Palm covers a lot of space, with over 1500 rooms and around 5000 guests, the lobby has the buzz of a lightly shaken hornets' nest but it is also so comically outsized – with calming water features, arresting marble floors and an insanely large glass sculpture by American sculptor Dale Chihuly featuring 3000 pieces of coloured glass – that you never feel crowded. As an Imperial Club guest I am whisked off to a quieter room (itself the size of a boutique hotel lobby) past the 11-million-litre Ambassador Lagoon, one of the top ten largest aquariums in the world. Check-in is a breeze and I am up in my room while my head is still spinning.</p>

      <h3>THE ROOM</h3>
      <p>Most of the bling is reserved for the public spaces and a Deluxe King offers muted, sand-coloured walls and marble-topped benches, the bed dressed simply in crisp white linen. My Palm Room looks back along the man-made island with beauty in the symmetry of the artificial fronds. Stepping on to the balcony you are hit by the sheer chutzpah it took to build Palm Jumeirah.</p>
      <h3>THE FOOD</h3>
      <p>Atlantis, The Palm's restaurants read like a wish list of MasterChef special guest judges: Gordon Ramsay, Giorgio Locatelli, Nobu Matsuhisa. But the real surprise is down the stunning staircase at Ayamna Lebanese restaurant, where you will find a banquet as OTT as Atlantis itself. You might have some cold mezze like a creamy shanklish cheese salad, silky labneh with garlic or a fish tajine with Middle Eastern spices. You might have hot mezze like grilled meats with cheese sambousek (filled pastry) and lamb kebbeh. You will have too much food.</p>
      <h3>STEPPING OUT</h3>
      <p>You don't, really, but if you must make a break for it, head just off the Palm Jumeirah to the expat haven of JBR (Jumeirah Beach Residences) and the Brits-behaving-badly party spot that is LSB (Lock, Stock and Barrel). This venue-cum-nightclub counts as grungy in highly polished Dubai and is packed tighter than the sand holding up the nearby Palm. Then hit JBR Walk, a pedestrian strip that takes in international hotel bars like tiki-tastic Trader Vic's.</p>
      <h3>THE VERDICT</h3>
      <p>Popular with the extended stopover crowd, Atlantis, The Palm is the ultimate fly-and-flop destination whether you want a burger by the pool or a six-hour brunch by Gordon Ramsay. There is a water park, the lost city of Atlantis-themed aquarium, kayaks to explore the nearby palm fronds, cocktails and shopping and upmarket hookah. Just remember to catch your next flight.</p>
      <h3>ESSENTIALS</h3>
      <p>Palm King rooms start from AED1067 ($A430) per night for two people with access to the water park and aquarium included. Imperial King Rooms start from AED1619 but you have access to a very good value happy hour each evening with drinks and buffet included, along with buffet breakfast, afternoon tea and airport transfers. Atlantis, The Palm, Crescent Road, Dubai, United Arab Emirates; See <a href="http://atlantis.com/dubai">atlantis.com/dubai</a></p>
      <h3>HIGHLIGHT</h3>
      <p>The scale: there's so much to do that you could get lost for a week.</p>
      <h3>LOWLIGHT</h3>
      <p>The scale: such a huge space you can get lost looking for your dinner reservation.</p>
      <h3>OUR SCORE OUT OF FIVE</h3>
      <p>4/5</p>
