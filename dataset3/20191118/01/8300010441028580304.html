      <p>The westbound 60 freeway is shut down for the final time this year as one part of the <a href="https://abc7.com/traffic/60-fwy-to-be-shut-down-over-multiple-weekends/5411969/">60 Swarm</a> officially comes to an end.<br/><br/>Portions of the freeway have been closed intermittently over the course of four months as crews replaced degraded slabs of pavement.<br/><br/>Officials say the work has gone twice as fast thanks to the closures - and are happy to have the freeway open for the holidays.<br/><br/>They also noted more closures may be needed in 2020, but no dates have been discussed yet.</p>
