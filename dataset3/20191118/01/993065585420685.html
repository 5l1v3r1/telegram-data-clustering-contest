      <p><b>Bailey Peacock-Farrell:</b> Looked a bit short of confidence, which is probably no surprise considering his lack of first team action at Burnley. Unsure under a couple of first half crosses and kicked the ball straight to orange jerseys twice in the space of two second half minutes. 6</p>
      <p><b>Stuart Dallas: </b>Operated in three different positions across the course of the evening and did well in all. Kept the dangerous Promes-Blind left wing axis fairly quiet the switched to left wing when Saville went off. Finished up in the middle marking Frenkie de Jong. 7.5</p>
      <p><b>Jonny Evans: </b>Composed and controlled as ever, marshalling the defence. Always seems to be in the right place at the right time. 7.5</p>
      <p><b>Craig Cathcart: </b>A couple of wayward passes but solid. Made a vital interception from a second half Blind cross with Babel waiting to pounce. 7</p>
      <p><b>Jamal Lewis: </b>Didn’t venture too far forward as the Northern Ireland full-backs help their shape and didn’t get too adventurous. Faced little threat in Berghuis, who offered next to nothing. 7</p>
      <p><b>Corry Evans: </b>Almost opened the scoring three minutes in when he charged down Jasper Cillessen, and it looked as though the ball might spin into the net before the danger was eventually cleared. Got through plenty of work and snuffed out danger a couple of times in the first half when the Dutch started to gather a bit of momentum. 6.5</p>
      <p><b>Paddy McNair:</b> Just as in Rotterdam five weeks ago, was tasked with limiting the influence of Frenkie de Jong and did a solid job. The Barcelona schemer showed flashes of his class, but that was all. McNair also delivered the superb cross that led to the penalty award. 7.5</p>
      <p><b>Steven Davis: </b>The Northern Ireland captain was winning his 116th cap, but this wasn’t one to remember – mainly because of a missed first half penalty when the Rangers man blazed over the bar. Picked up a yellow card not long after. Made a couple of vital interceptions, but not a game he’ll look back on with much fondness. 5.5</p>
      <p><b>George Saville:</b> Struggled to get into the game on the left flank but ghosted into the box for the penalty award, with his shot catching Veltman’s arm. 6.5</p>
      <p><b>Gavin Whyte: </b>Northern Ireland’s best player in the first half. Exposed the space behind Blind in an electric opening 10 minutes, and was the main threat all evening. His lovely reverse pass to McNair in the lead up to the penalty award was one of the few moments of real quality. Faded after the break. 7.5</p>
      <p><b>Josh Magennis: </b>Handed a tough beat as ever and worked from first minute until last. Flashed an early header wide, and also sent an effort over the bar early in the second half. Hassled and harried Van Dijk and De Ligt. 6.5</p>
      <p>
        <b>Substitutes</b>
      </p>
      <p><b>Michael Smith: </b>Came on in the 57th minute and went to right-back. Burst forward to send in a cross that was dealt with by the Dutch defence. 6</p>
      <p><b>Niall McGinn:</b> Played on the left wing for the last 20 minutes but by then any fizz had long gone from the game. 6</p>
      <p><b>Jordan Thompson: </b>Came into midfield for the final 10 minutes as the game fizzled out. 6</p>
