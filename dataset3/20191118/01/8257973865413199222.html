      <p>Nov. 17 (UPI) -- <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Kyle_Busch/?tps=1">Kyle Busch</a> captured his second Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series title with a win in the 2019 Ford EcoBoost 400 on Sunday at Homestead-Miami Speedway in Homestead, Fla.</p>
      <p>Busch, who led 120 of the 267 laps, won the season finale to snap his 21-race losing streak. He previously won the 2015 title and joins seven-time champion <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Jimmie_Johnson/?tps=1">Jimmie Johnson</a> as the only active drivers with multiple championships.</p>
      <p>"We have a great race team and a great owner," Busch said after climbing out of his car. "We have the best sponsor in sports. I just can't say enough and thank everyone enough. ... There's always your doubters, always your haters. But you know what? This one's for 'Rowdy Nation.'"</p>
      <p>Busch, 34, also became the 16th driver with more than one premier series championship. He is the first repeat champion in the elimination-style postseason.</p>
      <p>Busch outran <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Kevin_Harvick/?tps=1">Kevin Harvick</a>, <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Denny_Hamlin/?tps=1">Denny Hamlin</a>, <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Erik-Jones/?tps=1">Erik Jones</a> and <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Martin_Truex/?tps=1">Martin Truex</a> Jr. in the race. Hamlin was making his first Championship 4 appearance since 2014, while Truex Jr. and Harvick each were making returns to the finale.</p>

      <p>Hamlin and Truex Jr. had trouble on pit road that caused them to slip out of contention. Hamlin finished in 10th after a crew member added a large piece of tape across the front grille that caused his engine to overheat.</p>
      <p>Truex Jr. fell a lap back after his crew put tires on the wrong side of his car. He recovered to finish second.</p>
      <p>Busch's victory gave <a href="https://www.upi.com/topic/Joe_Gibbs/?tps=1">Joe Gibbs</a> Racing its fifth Cup title, and handed Toyota its third drivers' championship in five seasons.</p>
