      <p><b>CONCORDIA PARISH, La. (KNOE) -</b> Concordia Parish Sheriff’s Office deputies are investigating the death of three people found dead inside a home on Saturday.</p>
      <p>"When I got the phone call, I was just so heartbroken, because she never bothered anybody,” Khiry Anderson says. “She'd give you her last. Whatever it is, she'll give you her last."</p>
      <p>Anderson and his family now mourning the loss of his 95-year-old grandmother Rosie Hooper. On Saturday morning, Shirley Anderson called 911 after finding her Hooper unresponsive in her home.</p>
      <p>“The reaction I saw when I went in, I just had to run back out. It was just so painful,” Shirley says. “I just want justice for my mother and my two brothers."</p>
      <p>Investigators also found two more bodies inside, Ellis and Johnny Hooper, two of Rosie's sons.</p>
      <p>Deputies arrested Darrione Bell on three counts of 1st degree murder Saturday afternoon.</p>
      <p>"She used to take care of him when he was a baby. She used to babysit him,” Shirley says.</p>
      <p>Warren Neal, Rosie’s youngest son, says it hurts even more because of that. “For him to do this to her, it hurt me bad."</p>
      <p>Deputies have not released a motive, leaving several unanswered questions. But, they are looking for more suspects.</p>
      <p>"They're going to find him,” Neal says. “I'm sure that they're going to find who it was. And if he's out there, I want justice for my mom. One way or the other."</p>
      <p>"They killed three innocent people that didn't bother anybody,” Shirley says. “I just want justice for my mom and my two brothers. Whatever it takes, justice. Whatever they do with him, just justice. Put him away, throw the key away."</p>
