      <p>Stacey Solomon was in tears this evening as she watched Extra Camp this evening - which, for the first time in ten years, didn't feature Joe Swash.</p>
      <p>The Loose Women star, 30, was left feeling emotional tonight as she tuned in to I'm A Celebrity's spin-off show.</p>
      <p>Instead of seeing her boyfriend's smiling face, Joel Dommett was joined by new presenters Emily Atack and Adam Thomas.</p>
      <p>Taking to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> during the episode, she wrote with crying emojis: "Soooo wierd watching #ExtraCamp without you @realjoeswash."</p>

      <p>And viewers agreed, insisting it wasn't the same without him.</p>
      <p>One tweeted: "I don’t like it!! it’s not the same."</p>
      <p>While another commented: "It’s so not the same. Bring him back."</p>
      <p>A third remarked: "Missing @realjoeswash already."</p>
      <p>"Miss him already. Our loss is your gain," another wrote.</p>

      <p>Joe is set to take part in this year's Dancing On Ice, which he is already training for ahead of its launch in January.</p>
      <p>Ever since he won I'm A Celebrity in 2008, Joe has presented the ITV2 spin-off show for the main programme.</p>
      <p>Over the years he has hosted the show alongside a number of other presenters, including Caroline Flack, Russell Kane, Laura Whimore, Rob Beckett and even girlfriend Stacey Solomon.</p>
