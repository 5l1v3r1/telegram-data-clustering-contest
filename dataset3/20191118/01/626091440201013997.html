      <h1>US Firms Get 90-Day Extension To Work With Huawei On Rural Networks</h1>

      <p>The Trump administration is <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/18/780473704/u-s-firms-get-90-day-extension-to-work-with-huawei-on-rural-networks">giving American companies another three months to do business with the Chinese telecom giant Huawei</a>, the Commerce Department said Monday. From a report:<i> It is the third time the U.S. has extended a reprieve, which is meant to help ease disruption for Huawei customers. Many Internet and cellphone carriers in rural parts of the U.S. buy networking equipment from Huawei, and the temporary extension means they can keep their networks up to date. "The Temporary General License extension will allow carriers to continue to service customers in some of the most remote areas of the United States who would otherwise be left in the dark," said Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in a statement.</i></p>
