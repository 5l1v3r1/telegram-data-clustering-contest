      <p>CO TYRONE civil engineering and building firm Geda Construction has reported a 30 per cent surge in turnover.</p>
      <p>The Clonoe based company has been involved in a series of high profile projects in the past year, including the massive restoration of the Mourne Wall in Co Down for NI Water.</p>
      <p>The painstaking work on the north's longest listed monument was named project of the year at the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors awards in May.</p>
      <p>Geda Construction is headed by former Tyrone manager and three-time GAA all-star Eugene McKenna. It employed around 105 people during 2018.</p>
      <p>A new company report for Geda Construction limited liability partnership (LLP) reveal its turnover for the year ending December 31 2018 was £45.8m, some 29.5 per cent up on its 2017 figure of £35.4m.</p>
      <p>It helped generate an 11 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to £7.3m for the year.</p>
      <p>Some £41.2m of revenues is derived from UK-based work, with £4.6m generated from projects in the south of Ireland.</p>
      <p>According to Geda's latest company report, the limited partnership is set to be merged with Geda Construction Company Ltd from January 2020.</p>
      <p>Geda has an extensive portfolio of civil engineering projects for NI Water. Last year it was one of three firms awarded a share of a £35m framework contract by NI Water for works around Belfast.</p>
