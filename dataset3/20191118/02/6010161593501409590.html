      <h1>Red Dead Redemption 2 on its lowest PC settings is a faceless polygonal nightmare</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T02:47:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 02:47</time> by <a rel="author">Emily Gera</a></address>
      <p>What does Red Dead Redemption 2 look like on its lowest PC setting? Extremely weird.</p>
      <p>Rockstar’s cowboy blockbuster is now out on PC, and youtuber <a href="https://curiositystream.com/lowspecgamer">LowSpecGamer</a> is doing what they do best – sliding every visual option all the way down to their lowest setting, fiddling with files, and seeing what the hell happens.</p>
      <p>The result, as you can see for yourself in the video below, is a nightmarish world of faceless cowboys with hands but no fingers, eyeless horses, and invisible wagons.</p>

      <p>Red Dead Redemption 2 launched on PC earlier this month. The PC version comes loaded with a range of enhancements such as resolution support up to 8K, unlocked framerates, an extensive settings menu, a photo mode and several other PC-specific updates, which we previewed <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/11/01/red-dead-redemption-2-pc-preview-photo-mode/">when we played it recently</a>.</p>
