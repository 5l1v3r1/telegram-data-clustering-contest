      <p>Craig McLachlan is accused of indecently assaulting four female actors – including allegations he kissed and groped three of them while they were performing on stage – during the production of a Melbourne stage show.</p>
      <p>Mr McLachlan has pleaded not guilty to 17 charges, comprising counts of indecent assault, common assault and one of attempted assault, related to a stage production in Melbourne in 2014.</p>

      <p>The 54-year-old actor fronted Melbourne Magistrates Court on Monday for the beginning of a three-week contested hearing, during which prosecutor Matt Fisher outlined the allegations.</p>
      <p>Mr McLachlan allegedly kissed one woman, touched her breast and indecently assaulted her while the pair were in a scene together but he was concealed from the audience, Mr Fisher said, when the scene had not called for any physical contact.</p>
      <p>The actress had felt trapped because she was still visible to the audience, the prosecutor said.</p>
      <p>In another scene, Mr McLachlan allegedly ran a hand up a second woman’s leg while she was performing but he was not in the scene and was hidden off stage.</p>
      <p>Mr Fisher said when the woman looked down she saw Mr McLachlan with a ‘‘gleeful expression’’ on his face and then laughing.</p>
      <p>Mr McLachlan also allegedly kissed a third actress while they were on stage together, when their scene did not require a kiss.</p>
      <p>Mr Fisher said the woman felt frozen in the spotlight and began to cry, and then when she confronted the actor offstage, he told her: ‘‘Don’t you dare speak to me like that. You are nothing. I will end you.’’</p>
      <p>The actor is accused of kissing a fourth actress without her consent when he straddled her while she was seated on a couch backstage, the court heard.</p>
      <p>Mr Fisher said the four women were isolated and in vulnerable positions when they were indecently assaulted, and that in some cases they were performing in front of audiences and ‘‘unable to extricate themselves’’.</p>
      <p>Mr McLachlan continued offending in a ‘‘brazen manner’’, the prosecutor said, when the physical contact was not welcome.</p>
      <p>Defence counsel Stuart Littlemore, QC, said his client pleaded not guilty to all charges.</p>
      <p>Some charges did not constitute an indecent act, Mr Littlemore said, while Mr McLachlan denied some allegations happened.</p>
      <p>Mr Littlemore said Mr McLachlan had the discretion to ‘‘ad lib’’ in the show, both with the script and with his physical movements, in what performers described as ‘‘bits of business’’.</p>
      <p>The hearing continues.</p>
