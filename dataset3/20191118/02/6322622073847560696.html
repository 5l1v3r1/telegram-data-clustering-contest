      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 18): Hong Leong Investment Bank Research (HLIB) has downgraded UWC Bhd to "Buy" at RM2.68 with a higher target price of RM2.61 (from RM1.74), and said the stock had gained 218% since it initated coverage on July 10.</p>
      <p>In a note today, HLIB said UWC's 1QFY20 core net profit of RM10.6 million exceeded its expectations due to stronger-than-expected sales along with margins.</p>
      <p>It outlined the firm's corporate proposals, which are the bonus issue of up to 183.4 million new UWC shares on the basis of one for every two existing shares held and establishment of an employee share grant scheme of up to 10% of the total number of issued shares.</p>
      <p>UWC has proposed a final single-tier dividend of three sen per share for FY19 which is subject to shareholders approval in an annual general meeting on Jan 10, 2020.</p>
      <p>"If approved, it will go ex on Jan 14, 2020," said HLIB.</p>
      <p>UWC's quarter-on-quarter (q-o-q) turnover was flat at RM46.9 million, supported by strong semiconductor demand, especially on test equipment while life-science orders remained steady.</p>
      <p>The research house stated that 1QFY19 figures are not available for comparison as UWC was newly listed.</p>
      <p>"Despite the unfavourable market sentiment and ongoing trade tensions between US and China, UWC remains optimistic about its FY20 business prospects," HLIB said.</p>
      <p>UWC will continue to acquire new customers and improve performance moving forward.</p>
      <p>"With the new CNC machines which are slated to dock into the factory by year end, the group will relentlessly improve the efficiency as well as developing new products with existing and new customers," said the research house, noting this will further expand the company.</p>
      <p>At 10am, UWC shares added 2.24% or 6 sen to RM2.74 with 1.7 million shares traded.</p>
