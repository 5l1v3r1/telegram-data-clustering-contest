      <p>According to a report from the Los Angeles Times, this past weekend, <i>Ford v Ferrari</i> was number one at the box office whereas <i>Charlie’s Angels </i>tanked. Estimates from Comscore reported that the movie took in $31 million in its opening weekend against projections of $20 million, making the movie more successful than initially suspected.</p>
      <p>Even though the film performed quite well, the overall box office numbers were down in comparison to last year for the fifth weekend in a row. Reportedly, there was a drop of 37.6% of the same period when <i>Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes Of Grindelwald,</i> took home $62.2 million in its opening weekend.</p>
      <p>The box office movie business as a whole stands at $9.7 billion, which is 6.2% below 2018. <i>Ford v Ferrari</i> stars Matt Damon and Christian Bale, and it cost around $97 million to make. Based in 1966, the film tells the story of the two men who helped Ford Motor Company beat Ferrari in the Le Mans race.</p>
      <p>Not only was the film financially successful, but it was also critically successful as well, earning a very rare A+ CinemaScore rating as well as a 92% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. <i>Charlie’s Angels</i>, on the other hand, opened with a meager $8.6 million against projections of $12 to $13 million.</p>

      <p>Even though it didn’t do quite so well at the box office, <i>Charlie’s Angels</i> secured a B+ rating in CinemaScore as well as a 59% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The year 2000’s <i>Charlie’s Angels</i>, starring Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu, and Drew Barrymore, earned $264 million at the box office against a $93 million budget.</p>
