      <h1>Apple Reportedly Replacing iPhones With Smart Glasses "In Roughly a Decade"</h1>
      <h2>Continuing with Apple’s wearable tech initiative.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T02:46:59+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 02:46</time> by <a rel="author">Torsten Ingvaldsen</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/apple">Apple</a> will replace the <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/iphone">iPhone</a> with smart glasses “in roughly a decade,” as reported by <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-eyes-2022-release-for-ar-headset-2023-for-glasses">The Information</a>. According to sources at Apple, executives discussed the release timelines of various VR and AR headsets in an internal presentation to employees at the company’s Cupertino campus this past October. Vice President Mike Rockwell, who also heads Apple’s AR and VR initiatives, led the meeting, which reportedly included details surrounding the design and features of the headset.</p>
      <p>Senior Apple managers see the future of these headsets as replacing the smartphone completely. The first device, expected in 2022, is said to resemble the <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2018/9/oculus-quest-standalone-headset">Oculus Quest</a> virtual-reality headset, featuring high-resolution displays, cameras mounted to the inside, as well as the ability to map its surroundings. The second, slimmer iteration, will be more representative of a pair of normative sunglasses, toting a thick frame to house a battery as well as processors. The latter is said to be intended for all-day use, making it a step closer to Apple’s longterm goal of replacing its flagship smartphone.</p>
      <p>The tech titan has been working on a form of augmented-reality eyewear since 2015 but has yet to update the public on any form of AR hardware projects, staying in line with the company’s usual trajectory of keeping new projects under-the-rug until their official reveal. Much of this wearable tech remains a part of the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-14/apple-said-to-explore-smart-glasses-in-deeper-wearables-push">company’s emphasis</a> to include technology into more functional aspects of daily life.</p>
