      <p>GOING into the fight of his career, for the world middleweight title in Brooklyn this December, boxer Dennis Hogan knew his training would involve more than just practicing his left hook.</p>
      <p>After losing a fight for the super-welterweight world title in December 2015, Brisbane-based fighter Hogan knew he needed an edge and began working closely with MJB Seminars human development expert Mitch Behan to help improve his performance and get him the title.</p>
      <p>“You can have as much physical skill as you want but if your mind does not believe it and you do not feel it in your heart, you will not win,” Behan said.</p>
      <p>“The work I’ve been doing with Dennis isn’t a matter of getting him to regurgitate positive affirmations or repeat silly phrases ad nauseam.</p>

      <p>“It goes far deeper into his past, present and future until he experiences his win.</p>
      <p>“Not simply to see it or imagine it, but to feel it and know it at his very core and in every cell of his being.”</p>
      <p>Just like training in the ring, Hogan spends an hour or so every day thinking about and visualising winning the world title, the celebrations that follow and a champion homecoming in Ireland, blurring the lines between dreams and reality to the degree that he feels he is already a world champion.</p>
      <p>“It’s already happened, I’m just bridging the gap,” he said.</p>
      <p>“I fully believe there are no obstacles in my way, it’s happening, it’s already happened, and I’m just enjoying the ride.</p>
      <p>“I have that much confidence. I’ve completely relinquished all emotion towards it and I just feel like it’s happening.”</p>

      <p>Beyond simply wanting to win a title, Hogan is also actualising a far bigger vision to strengthen the entire boxing industry in Australia.</p>
      <p>Along with his friends Danny and Paul, he set up DDP Promotions with a mission to bring the best fights and fighters to Australia.</p>
      <p>Behan said using the MJB Seminars performance and visualisation technique has solid scientific data to back its effectiveness.</p>
      <p>“Neurologically, our brain doesn’t know the difference between what we imagine and what we see in reality,” he said.</p>
      <p>“In other words, the brain thinks what we imagine or visualise is just as real as what our eyes perceive.</p>
      <p>“So when we visualise something strongly and regularly enough and know, wholeheartedly, that we are already living the experience, the manifestation of it will find its way to us.”</p>
      <p>Behan has been studying the science behind this kind of training for more than 20 years and has worked with the elites in the field of human potential including Dr John De Martini and Dr Joe Dispenza.</p>
