      <h1>Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop Holiday Guide Shocks Audience With BDSM Kit, Brass Fire Extinguisher</h1>
      <h2>Gwyneth Paltrow’s brand, Goop, which periodically hits the headlines with strange deals and items, has launched its holiday gift guide, which includes $43,000 earrings and a BDSM kit.</h2>

      <p>The self-described modern lifestyle brand, which sells mostly fashion, beauty, wellness and home products, is offering shoppers some bizarre and absurdly expensive items this year. Goop itself calls it a “ridiculous but awesome gift guide.”</p>
      <p>The most expensive items on the list are the million-dollar investment that will send you on 12 trips to spot endangered species, including North Pole and Indonesia. And, if this is not enough for you – you can go to space with a reserved seat on a flight with Virgin Galactic, if such a flight is to happen someday.</p>
      <p>Compared to these trip plans, a Brass Fire Extinguisher for $250 and a flight on an iron man-ish flight suit for almost $6,500 do not seem so weird. Another distinguishing item is an automatic joint-roller. This could be a solution for those who, unlike Snoop Dogg, cannot afford to hire a personal joint-roller.</p>
      <p>The most unusual item on the list, however, is <a href="https://shop.goop.com/shop/products/restraining-arts-kit?country=USA">a BDSM-inspired kit</a> that includes leather wrist and ankle cuffs and a leather-bound paddle. </p>
      <blockquote>“Think of this kit as a beginner’s guide to BDSM,” says Goop’s website. “It’s even equipped with DIY restraining straps, to help you, him, or her assume the position (wink, wink).”</blockquote>
