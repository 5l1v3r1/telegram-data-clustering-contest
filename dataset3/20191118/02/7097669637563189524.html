      <p>WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States condemned the "unjustified use of force" in Hong Kong and called on Beijing to protect Hong Kong's freedom, a senior official in President Donald Trump's administration said Sunday, as protesters battled Hong Kong police who had trapped them inside a major university.</p>
      <p>“We condemn the unjustified use of force and urge all sides to refrain from violence and engage in constructive dialogue," the senior U.S. official said.</p>
      <p>"As the President has said, the United States expects Beijing to honor its commitments under the Sino-British joint Declaration and to protect Hong Kong’s freedom, legal system and democratic way of life," the official said.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong police sealed off the Polytechnic University and demonstrators rampaged through a tourist district, after almost two straight days of standoffs that have raised fears of a bloody showdown.</p>
