      <p>The longtime Trump supporter frequently posts videos on social media praising Trump. In May, <a href="https://twitter.com/jonvoight/status/1132093445743489024">Voight posted</a> two videos to Twitter in which he assures the president he has Republicans’ “utmost respect and our love.”</p>
      <p>“This job is not easy, for he’s battling the left and their absurd words of destruction,” Voight said. “Our nation has been built on the solid ground from our forefathers, and there is a moral code of duty that has been passed on from President Lincoln.”</p>
      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/jonvoight/status/1132094914026770432">He went on</a>, “Our country is stronger, safer and with more jobs because our president has made his every move correct. Don’t be fooled by the political left because we are the people of this nation that is witnessing triumph.”</p>

      <p>“Let us stand up for this truth: that President Trump is the greatest president since Abraham Lincoln,” Voight concluded.</p>
      <p>In March, Trump appointed Voight — along with former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee — to the board of trustees of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.</p>
