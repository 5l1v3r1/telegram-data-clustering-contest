      <p>PRINCE GEORGE’S COUNTY, Md. (Gray News) - Cellphone video captured a fight Friday morning between a teacher and student at a Maryland high school.</p>
      <p>Thirty-six-year-old Vivian Noirie is charged with second-degree assault and physical child abuse.</p>
      <p>The student is a minor, so police did not identify her. They did, however, describe her as a 17-year-old. Authorities are using the juvenile court system to pursue charges against her.</p>
      <p>In an <a href="http://pgpolice.blogspot.com/2019/11/pgpd-announces-charges-in-connection-to.html">arrest report</a>, investigators said the student confronted Noirie because the teacher had contacted her parents the night before.</p>
      <p>Police said the student admitted to stepping on Noirie’s foot and bumping the teacher with her shoulder. When that happened, investigators said Noirie started throwing punches at the student.</p>
      <p>Other employees momentarily broke up the brawl. But even after they’d been pulled apart, the student found her way back to Noirie to throw more punches, authorities said.</p>
      <p>Administrators separated them again, this time for good, and called police.</p>
      <p>Despite the fisticuffs, neither of them required medical attention.</p>
