      <p><b>THEATRE<br/>OIL ★★★½<br/>By Ella Hickson, Red Stitch Actors Theatre<br/>Cromwell Road Theatre, South</b> <b>Yarra, until December 15</b></p>
      <p>To stage Ella Hickson’s <i>Oil</i>, an ambitious, time-travelling epic that spans more than a century, Red Stitch has shifted the premiere from its usual St Kilda East haunt to a more capacious theatre in South Yarra. It pays off. This is a strikingly designed and atmospheric production, with enough oxygen to ignite performances from its large and talented ensemble, and to feed the burning concerns that fuel the play.</p>
      <p>Using the device of a mother and daughter whisked through time, Hickson marries domestic drama and the geopolitics of the oil industry, mingling the perennial struggle between parent and child with the lust for energy that has powered modernity.</p>

      <p>On a dingy farm in Cornwall in the late 19th century, the dour Ma Singer (Jennifer Vuletic) presides over a household where mere subsistence requires relentless, grinding work. Her son Joss (Charlie Cousins) chops wood, but it isn’t enough to keep his pregnant wife May (Daniela Farinacci) warm on a winter’s night.</p>
      <p>When a representative from a kerosene company appears, shows off a new oil lamp and offers to buy the farm, May chooses progress over passion.</p>
      <p>The action leaps forward to Persia, 1908. Now a single mother with her eight-year-old daughter Amy (Hannah Fredericksen) in tow, May is thrust behind the scenes of aggressive British foreign policy (embodied by Matthew Whitty) seeking to secure oil supply in the Middle East.</p>
      <p>By 1970, a rebellious teenage Amy canoodles with her boyfriend (Darcy Brown) as her mother – now an oil company CEO – tries to tame a Libyan emissary (Khisraw Jones-Shukoor) demanding nationalisation, while laying down the law on her daughter’s sex life.</p>
      <blockquote>A work of grand scope and searching dramatic intelligence</blockquote>
      <p>The finale jumps into a near future to pit an idealistic, activist Amy against an even more powerful May trying to save her from a Middle Eastern war zone, before sketching the two in a bleak world where blackouts are commonplace and (in an echo of the kerosene salesman) a rep from a Chinese company (Jing-Xuan Chan) spruiks palm-sized cold fusion generators.</p>
      <p>Ella Caldwell’s production utilises a traverse stage to frame accomplished performances, led by the tough, brilliantly sustained intensity of Farinacci, playing a woman from youth to old age whose love is compromised by unsustainable decisions.</p>
      <p>Opposite her, Fredericksen shifts through phases of life – precocious innocent, rebellious teen, woman of conscience, carer to her mother – with charisma and psychological precision.</p>
      <p>Some of the male parts feel two-dimensional in comparison, yet <i>Oil</i> remains a work of grand scope and searching dramatic intelligence, and this production does justice to it.</p>
