      <h1>The new cheaper Sky Q box can record six shows simultaneously</h1>
      <h2>Full access to Sky’s UHD content and enough storage for every Sopranos episode</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T02:47:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 02:47</time> by <a rel="author">Henry Burrell</a></address>
      <p>Sky has announced <a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=11005&amp;awinaffid=254429&amp;clickref=06-3778000-11-0000000&amp;p=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.sky.com%2Fshop%2Ftv%2Fsky-q%2F">a new Sky Q box with 1TB storage</a> that can record up to six programmes at the same time. Priced from £25, the Sky Q 1TB UHD box joins the existing £50 2TB option, making the technology more affordable to customers.</p>
      <p>The 1TB box means anyone with a <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/tv/sky-q-3643602/">Sky Q</a> subscription can watch and record UHD content, watch on-demand UHD premieres and UHD sports coverage. Both the 1TB and 2TB models allow for streaming on two boxes at a time per household.</p>
      <p>Sky says that the 2TB box has enough storage to save 420 episodes of Peppa Pig, so parents looking to restrict this number can happily plump for 1TB and halve their passive Peppa intake to a mere 210 instalments.</p>
      <p>Both Sky Q UHD boxes benefit from Sky’s voice search to quicker find what you need, though we still recommend using the remote. More handily they support Sky’s ‘carry on’ feature so you can pick up a show you were halfway through on a different TV in the house.</p>
      <p>Sky packages are notoriously expensive to get the full breadth of content, but a £25 1TB box is a good price for what you get. Sky Q packages start at £22.</p>
      <p>Sky also pointed out in a statement that Sky Q plays nice with Netflix. TV in 2019 is a funny position where a selling point of a broadcaster like Sky is integration with a rival streaming subscription service, but here we are.</p>
