      <p><a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/gujarat-bjp-defends-purchase-of-191-cr-jet-for-cm-dignitaries/article29921894.ece">Taking a veiled dig at his Gujarat counterpart Vijay Rupani</a>, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday said that instead of buying a ₹191-crore plane for himself he preferred to provide free ride to women in public transport buses.</p>
      <p>He said that opposition parties were getting “uncomfortable” by his government’s schemes for facilitating people.</p>
      <p>“We allowed free travel to women in public transport buses and the opposition raised noise over it. People ask where did the money for it come from. The Chief Minister of a State bought a plane worth ₹191 crore for himself. I did not buy a plane and instead made travel free for my sisters,” CM Kejriwal said at Rithala here.</p>

      <p>The women in Delhi have been allowed free travel in public transport buses by the AAP government from October 29.</p>
      <p>The move coming a few months before the Delhi Assembly polls due early next year has been criticised by the BJP as a “freebie” for political gains.</p>
      <p>Inaugurating construction of roads in Rohini under Rithala Assembly constituency, Mr. Kejriwal said opposition parties were not happy with his government’s schemes for the people.</p>
      <p>“We made 200 units of power consumption free and opposition leaders are opposing it. Their MPs get free 4,000 units free, but if a driver gets it, they are pained,” he said.</p>
      <p>The Chief Minister said that cost of road construction will be brought down by reusing old road material.</p>
      <p>He said the new roads will be constructed by digging up the old ones and reusing the dug up material. He said the technique will save 30% of construction cost.</p>
      <p>The technique which will overcome the problem of uneven road surface, was available earlier but was not employed due to corruption, he said.</p>
