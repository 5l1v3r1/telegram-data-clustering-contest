      <h2>The total amount of African-American-owned businesses rose to 2.6 million last year.</h2>

      <p>The number of <a href="https://www.inc.com/anna-meyer/2018-inc5000-african-american-led-businesses.html">African American-owned businesses</a> in America has ballooned in the past few years, increasing 37 percent between 2007 and 2012, when the U.S. Census Bureau last tallied the nation's black-owned businesses at 2.6 million. While that overall growth is exceptional, <a href="https://www.inc.com/surge-cities/best-places-start-business.html">some places served as prime breeding grounds</a> for these entrepreneurs. Here's a look at the states that house the highest concentration of fast-growing black-owned enterprises, according to the Inc. 5000, an annual list of the <a href="https://www.inc.com/inc5000/2019/top-private-companies-2019-inc5000.html">fast-growing private companies in the U.S</a>.  </p>
