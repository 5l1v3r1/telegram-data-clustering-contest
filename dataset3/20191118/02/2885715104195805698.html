      <p>Health of the environment is the main concern if we wish to make Article 21, which guarantees right to life, meaningful. That is the only way one can actually translate that right into reality. Health of the environment is correlated and connected with the right to life.</p>
      <p>This was stated by Balram K Gupta, director of <a href="https://indianexpress.com/elections/chandigarh-lok-sabha-election-results/">Chandigarh</a> Judicial Academy, during a session on air pollution at the Global Law Conference on Environmental Law at Chandigarh University on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Referring to the apex court which had suspended the environmental clearance granted to Goa’s international Mopa airport project leading to stoppage of the construction work there due to environmental hazards, he said, “This linkage has been beautifully brought out by the judicial bench of Supreme Court. Though this airport had been the major need of that particular area as Goa attracts so much of international tourism and in that process the airport had been on the map and consideration for the government to settle. But its suspension shows the concern of the judiciary for the future generations to come. It is the human element that is directly linked with environment. That is the concern. The health of environment is directly related to right to life. If environment is not taken seriously, our very right becomes threatened.”</p>
      <p>Gupta said, “The fundamental rights, directive principles and fundamental duties together are the best recipe to focus on the issue of environment. Article 21, 47, 48A and Article 51A, sub-clause G — all talk about the same. These last two Articles were added in year 1976 by 42nd amendment, especially to focus on such issues.”</p>
      <p>Talking about the importance of judiciary in playing an active role in making people aware of environmental issues, he said, “Judiciary in India plays a significant role in translating the fundamental rights, directive principles and fundamental duties of people of India. I say this because the judiciary in India has made the people aware through various judgments, that people have an important role to play in saving the environment.”</p>
      <p>To calculate the seriousness of the issue, he cited the case of Taj Mahal, saying, “The case of Taj Mahal raises serious concerns. One of the only seven wonders of the world and look what is happening to it. How the white marble is changing into yellow and further to brown depicts a serious impact of problem at hand.”</p>
      <p>Discussing solutions, he said, “Sustainable development and precautionary principles are the need of the hour. Focus needs to be on future. If you can create awareness for present with a concern for future through various adjudications of the apex court, that’s a contribution in itself.”</p>
      <p>Talking about his life in Chandigarh and how it has been affected, he told Newsline, “I have been in Chandigarh since 1956 and have enjoyed my morning walks and evening drives. All of that has become difficult as over the five years, even Chandigarh has come under the shadow of pollution and vehicular congestion. People have to be sensitised to protect the environment they live in. They have to know it belongs to them and they must take care of it.”</p>
