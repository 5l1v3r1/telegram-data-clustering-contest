      <h1>Introducing The 2021 Ford Mustang Mach-E: An Icon Goes Electric</h1>
      <h2>Like it or not, the Mustang just got electrified.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T02:30:53+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 02:30</time> by <a rel="author">Jared Rosenholtz</a></address>
      <p>Well, that didn't go to plan. Ford's big LA reveal lost a bit of its shine when <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/leaked-this-is-the-ford-mustang-mach-e-before-youre-meant-to-see-it">the Mustang Mach-E leaked </a>along with all of the pertinent information about the car. But let's not dwell on a mistake because now the<a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/ford/mach-e"> 2021 Ford Mustang Mach-E</a> has made its official reveal and the big topic on everyone's minds is Ford's decision to apply the Mustang name to an all-electric crossover. Only time will tell whether or not this move will resonate with potential buyers and loyal Mustang enthusiasts but based on the specifications for the car, all signs point to the Mach-E being a success.</p>
      <p>"At the first-ever Detroit auto show, Henry Ford said he was working on something that would strike like forked lightning," Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company said in a press release. "That was the Model T. Today, the Ford Motor Company is proud to unveil a car that strikes like forked lightning all over again. The all-new, all-electric Mustang Mach-E. It's fast. It's fun. It's freedom. For a new generation of Mustang owners." Ford clearly feels confident in its new product or else it would have called it a Mustang.</p>

      <p>Let's start with performance, which is a hallmark of any successful Mustang model. Ford will offer rear-wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive variants, both of which will come in standard- and long-range battery configurations. With AWD, the standard Mach-E is targeting 332 horsepower and 417 lb-ft of torque with a 0-60 mph time in the mid-five-second range, putting it on the same performance level as a <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/ford/mustang">Mustang</a> EcoBoost. The GT model will be much quicker, with a 0-60 mph time of under four seconds while a GT Performance edition should match the <a href="https://carbuzz.com/cars/ford/mustang-shelby-gt500">Shelby GT500's </a>0-60 mph time of around 3.5 seconds.</p>

      <p>Ford says both GT models will produce around 459 hp and 612 lb-ft of torque, so there should be no complaints from Mustang die-hards about the Mach-E's performance. Even more impressive, Ford is targetting a range of around 270 miles for the extended-range AWD model and around 300 miles for extended-range RWD models. The smaller battery models should go 230 miles with RWD (210 with AWD) and the GT model will go 235 miles. Charging should also be a cinch with the optional Ford Connected Charging station, which can add up to 32 miles of range per hour on a household 240-volt outlet. The Ford mobile charger included with the vehicle can add around 22 miles for every hour of charge.</p>

      <p>Ford has partnered with Amazon to handle the installation of the Connected Charging Station. But if you need to charge on the go, Ford has also <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/ford-makes-sure-charging-your-electric-car-will-be-easy">partnered with Electrify America </a>to give Mach-E owners access to the largest public charging network in the country with more than 12,500 stations. On a DC charger with a peak charging rate of 150 kW, an extended-range RWD Mach-E can add 47 miles of range in approximately 10 minutes and charge from 10 percent to 80 percent in around 38 minutes. Owners can also find charging stations using the FordPass app or on the vehicle's navigation system.</p>
      <p>The Mach-E will be among the first vehicles to take advantage of Ford's new <a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/fords-new-infotainment-makes-bmw-owners-feel-ripped-off">Sync4 infotainment system</a>. We only had a short time to play on the 15.5-inch touchscreen but it seems intuitive and will adapt to owners as it learns their behaviors (such as suggesting a route to the gym after work). This new Sync system also features over-the-air updates and comes with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.</p>

      <p>We had an early opportunity to ride in the Mach-E and found the overall interior quality and layout to be impressive. This is by far the most premium-feeling Mustang cabin Ford has ever built with soft, vegan simulated leather, an open center console, a floating armrest with room below it for a bag or purse, and available Bang &amp; Olufsen speakers wrapped in a premium-feeling cloth material. A giant glass roof adds to the sense of openness in the cabin and although it doesn't have a cover, Ford says the glass has infrared protection from UV rays.</p>
      <p>Unlike any Mustang before it, the Mach-E will be comfortable enough to fit four or five adults with their luggage. The rear trunk offers 29 cubic feet of space, which opens up to 59.6 cubic feet of space with the rear seats folded. In the front, there is also a small 4.8 cubic foot 'frunk' (yes, that's what Ford calls it) where you can fit a small carry-on bag.</p>

      <p>Five trim levels will be available at launch: Select, California Route 1, Premium, First Edition, and GT (plus the GT Performance Edition). Leaked pricing details suggest that the Select trim starts at <b>$43,895</b> while the Premium costs <b>$50,600</b>. AWD and the extended-range battery will add to these prices. The California Route 1 trim is RWD-only at <b>$52,400</b> and the First Edition is AWD-only at <b>$59,900 </b>and includes red-painted brake calipers, metallic pedal covers, contrasting seat stitching, and a 'First Edition' scuff plate.</p>
      <p>The GT model is the most expensive at <b>$60,500</b> but will be the only trim available with Brembo's new performance Flexira aluminum calipers. The GT Performance Edition will also be the only model to include Ford's MagneRide adaptive suspension technology. All Mach-E trims include three drive modes - Whisper, Engage, and Unbridled - which change the characteristics of the car such as the throttle calibration, steering, gauge cluster, and interior lighting.</p>

      <p>Ford is now taking pre-orders for the Mach-E with a $500 reservation deposit. Deliveries are expected to begin in late 2020 with the GT arriving in the spring of 2021. If you want one, you are going to have to place an order because unlike any other Ford product, the Mach-E will have order-based deliveries at dealerships instead of a traditional inventory structure.</p>
      <p>This is the first time Ford has given customers the option to purchase a car using e-commerce. In our conversations with Ford, it sounds like this process should keep the vehicle in high demand while also limiting the potential for silly markups. As, if the dealership closest to you wants to charge over sticker price for the car, you should be able to change delivery to another location.</p>
