      <p>ORLANDO, Nov 18 — Nikola Vucevic collected 30 points and 17 rebounds to record his 10th double-double of the season as the host Orlando Magic posted a 125-121 victory over the Washington Wizards yesterday.</p>
      <p>Vucevic shot 11 of 14 and Evan Fournier highlighted his 25-point performance with five 3-pointers for the Magic, who have won three in a row.</p>
      <p>Markelle Fultz made all six of his shots in the first half and finished with a season-high 19 points.</p>
      <p>Bradley Beal followed up consecutive 44-point performances by scoring 34 and CJ Miles added 21 for the Wizards, who lost for just the fifth time in their last 25 meetings with Orlando.</p>
      <p>Beal sank three 3-pointers during a four-possession stretch to help Washington trim Orlando’s lead to 117-116 with 1:01 remaining, but Vucevic drained a pair of free throws and Fultz converted a three-point play to keep the Wizards at bay.</p>
      <p>Orlando’s DJ Augustin was enjoying a strong night before dislocating the fifth metacarpal bone on his left hand in the second quarter, the team announced. X-rays were negative and he returned to the contest in the third quarter and finished with 13 points.</p>
      <p>Moritz Wagner made a layup and a 3-pointer as part of an 8-0 run for Washington before Orlando regained its composure. Terrence Ross sank all three free throws after being fouled, Vucevic drained a 3-pointer and Fournier followed suit on the next possession as the Magic extended their advantage to 106-91.</p>
      <p>Orlando relied heavily on Vucevic, Fournier and Fultz in the first half, with the three players combined to shoot 14 of 18 and 5 of 7 from 3-point range to record 39 of the team’s 61 points. The trio capped a 12-5 surge to end the half, with Fournier sinking five free throws, Fultz providing an emphatic dunk among his two baskets and Vucevic draining a 3-pointer in the surge.</p>
      <p>Magic guard Michael Carter-Williams missed both of his shots from the floor prior to exiting in the second quarter after straining his left hip. He was ruled out of the game.</p>
      <p>The Magic were also without power forward Jonathan Isaac, who rolled his right ankle on Thursday during the unveiling of the team’s City-Edition uniforms at Disney World. — Reuters</p>
