      <h1>Port Adelaide has made a bold draft call. It will help them secure a son of a gun</h1>

      <h3>Port Adelaide has made a bold decision to hand over their 2020 first round pick to gain an extra selection at next week’s national draft.</h3>
      <p>The Power struck a deal with Brisbane in order to move up the draft order, resulting in the club walking into the draft with Pick 12, 16 and 18 at their disposal.</p>
      <p>But the Lions will be backing the club to do poorly in 2020, given Port Adelaide has handed over their first-round selection for next year.</p>

      <p>Brisbane receives Port’s 2020 first-round pick, Pick 29 in 2019 and Pick 71 in 2019, handing over Pick 16, 52, 55 and 72.</p>
      <p>The trade helps Port Adelaide move up the draft order before a potential bid on father-son prospect Jackson Mead — which is likely to come in the second round — allowing the club to take three selections on night one and match a bid with their stockpiled fourth round selections.</p>
      <p>“We were eager to secure an extra first-round pick in this year’s draft, which is less compromised than next year’s, and this fits our strategy over the last couple of years of securing more top-end talent,” said Port Adelaide general manager of football Chris Davies.</p>
      <p>“We are also mindful of having access to a number of potential father-son and NGA recruits both this year and next, so we wanted to give ourselves the best opportunity to select them if we choose to do so.</p>

      <p>“This swap has left us in a strong position to attack the draft later this month.”</p>
      <p>Brisbane’s first selection in the 2019 draft is now currently Pick 21, with the club offloading late selections they would’ve been unable to use due to their list size.</p>
      <p>The 2019 national draft will be broadcast live on FOX FOOTY on November 27 and 28.</p>
