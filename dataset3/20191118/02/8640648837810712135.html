      <h1>Raiders rookie Foster Moreau emerging as red zone threat</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T02:39:46+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 02:39</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/staff/myles-simmons/" target="_blank">Myles Simmons</a></address>
      <p>OAKLAND, Calif. — Foster Moreau could see it coming. He knew he was going to score.</p>
      <p>That’s at least what the rookie tight end told the media about his 2-yard touchdown reception in the second quarter that tied the Raiders and Bengals at seven.</p>
      <p>“I knew from the moment it left Derek’s lips, to be honest with you,” Moreau said. “Walked up and ripped through the D-line, kept my eyes down, came out late, easy.”</p>
      <p>Quarterback Derek Carr, however, didn’t quite see that third-and-1 play from the Cincinnati 2 the same way.</p>
      <p>“Foster can see better into the future than I can,” Carr said with a laugh. “I knew there was a chance, but with him being that confident — that fires me up.”</p>
      <p>Moreau has emerged as a strong red-zone threat in the Raiders offense, with Sunday’s touchdown his fourth of the season. He’s had scores of 18, 10, 3 and 2 yards — and three of the four have resulted in Oakland taking a lead.</p>
      <p>Fellow tight end Darren Waller said Moreau’s work behind the scenes has allowed him to be productive.</p>
      <p>“Just the work he’s putting, how much he’s improving as far as the timing of where he needs to be,” Waller said. “And getting in windows — being deceptive as far as how he’s running and setting things up.</p>
      <p>”He’s just becoming a well-rounded football player.”</p>
      <p>Through 10 games, Moreau has 16 receptions for 142 yards with four touchdowns. Raiders coach Jon Gruden said there’s a chance for Moreau’s role to continue to expand this season.</p>
      <p>“I think you’re going to see more and more from Moreau down the stretch here as a receiver,” Gruden said. “He’s a guy that can do a lot of things.”</p>
