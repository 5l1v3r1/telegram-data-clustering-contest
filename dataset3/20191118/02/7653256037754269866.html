Minutes of the Federal Reserve’s last policy meeting are set to be released on Wednesday.</p>
      <p><b>Oil prices flat amid lack of directional cues<br/></b>Oil prices were little changed following steady gains in the previous week with investors awaiting fresh clues over prospects for a trade deal between the United States and China, shrugging off concerns over steadily rising oil supplies.

      <p><b>MACROS<br/></b><b>Software isn’t manufacturing, won’t get 15% tax<br/></b>Software development is not manufacturing and will not be eligible for the 15% tax rate applicable to new manufacturing entities, reports ET. The government will table a Bill in Parliament in the upcoming winter session to clarify this and other related matters. The Bill will replace its earlier ordinance in September. The amendment comes after industry sought clarity on whether software development could be treated as manufacturing and be eligible for the reduced tax rate.</p>
      <p><b>SBI, govt plan priority status for real estate AIF<br/></b>State Bank of India (SBI) and the ministry of finance are exploring a legal framework where the proposed alternative investment fund (AIF) for reviving stalled real estate projects will have the first charge on assets and cash flow of entities receiving funding. This may call for introducing changes in the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) to incorporate the concept of seniority of lenders which the code in its present form does not adequately recognise, two senior industry sources familiar with the development told ET.</p>
      <p><b>Revival of royalty payment caps for tech transfer likely<br/></b>The government is considering to re-introduce restrictions on royalty payments for technology transfer in view of excessive outflow of such funds to overseas companies, sources said. A proposal in this regard will soon be circulated by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) for inter-ministerial consultation, sources said.</p>
      <p><b>Curbs on FDI by JVs of Indian cos may be eased<br/></b>In a bid to ease the flow of foreign funds into legitimate business activities, the government may soon ease restrictions on <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/foreign-direct-investment">foreign direct investment</a> (FDI) by joint ventures (JVs) or wholly-owned subsidiaries (WOS) of an Indian company without categorising such investments as "suspect" involving 'round tripping' of funds, reports IANS. The existing legal framework under FEMA does not permit FDI by an overseas JV or WOS of an Indian party without the prior approval of RBI. Similarly, there are restrictions on Indian entities to undertake overseas direct investment (ODI) in a foreign entity which already has existing FDI investment structures in India. Changes would soon be be made in ODI norms to ease the curbs and put FDI and ODI under the automatic route.</p>
      <p><b>MF investment in equities halves in 2019<br/></b><a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/definition/Mutual-fund">Mutual fund</a> investment in stock markets halved to Rs 55,700 crore in the first 10 months of the year because of lower participation from retail investors. Fund managers had bought shares worth about Rs 1.12 lakh crore during January-October 2018, according to the data provided by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).</p>
      <p><b>China, US have ‘constructive discussions’ on phase-one trade deal<br/></b>Chinese Vice Premier Liu He spoke with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer about a phase-one trade deal in a phone call Saturday morning, according to Chinese state media. The two sides had “constructive discussions” about “each other’s core concerns” and agreed to remain in close contact, Xinhua reported. The call came at the request of Mnuchin and Lighthizer, according to Xinhua.</p>
      <p><b>India has potential for very rapid growth: Gates<br/></b>India has the potential for "very rapid" economic growth over the next decade which will lift people out of poverty and allow the government to invest in health and education priorities in an "exciting way", billionaire philanthropist and <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/Microsoft">Microsoft</a> co-founder Bill Gates has said to PTI. The positive outlook by Gates for the Indian economy, comes at a time when it is reeling under major slowdown amid apprehensions that the cycle may last for a longer period.</p>
