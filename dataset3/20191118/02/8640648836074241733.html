      <p>OAKLAND, Calif.—Bengals coach Zac Taylor had little information on the status of wide receiver Auden Tate after his team suffered a <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/sports/raiders/raiders-defeat-cincinnati-bengals-17-10-1894935/">17-10 loss to the Raiders</a> on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Tate was carted off the field in the fourth quarter after he was hit by Oakland safety Curtis Riley while making a diving catch on a 20-yard gain.</p>
      <p>He stayed down on the grass at Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum for several minutes while being tended to by the training staff.</p>
      <p>“I can just tell you he was responsive to me,” Taylor said after the game. “He could talk and motion and all that. Hopefully it was just mostly precautionary, but again, I don’t have anymore details on that.”</p>
      <p>The organization expected Tate to fly home with the team, NFL Network reported late Sunday.</p>
      <p>Tate, a 22-year-old out of Florida State, waved and gave a thumbs up as he was loaded onto a cart while strapped to a stretcher.</p>
      <p>He was Cincinnati’s leading receiver in the game with four catches for 56 yards.</p>
