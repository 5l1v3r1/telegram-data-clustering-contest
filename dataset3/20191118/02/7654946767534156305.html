      <p>LANDOVER, Md. — Meet the Jets’ new unblockable pass-rusher.</p>
      <p>Jamal Adams? Yes, that Jamal Adams.</p>
      <p>The Pro Bowl safety anchored a dominant defensive performance Sunday with three sacks <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/17/jets-finally-steadying-ship-as-confidence-quietly-grows/">in a 34-17 victory at FedEx Field</a>.</p>
      <p>With just two career interceptions on the back end, Adams now has six sacks in the three games since his public trade-deadline spat with the Jets front office. That’s more sacks than he had in his first two NFL seasons combined (5.5).</p>
      <p>“The picks are not coming my way,” Adams said, “so I thought I’d do something different.”</p>
      <p>Jets defensive coordinator Gregg Williams<a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/17/sam-darnold-has-overcome-nightmare-dwayne-haskins-is-living/"> threw blitzes at Dwayne Haskins</a>, as he is known to do against rookie quarterbacks. Haskins, who did most of his damage after falling into a 31-point hole, has had difficulty identifying blitz pickups during his first four NFL games.</p>
      <p>“We wanted to switch up different looks and show them something different than we did last game,” Adams said. “They kept sliding [protection] to me every time. I’m just lucky enough I have great teammates who can make him step up in the pocket. If they do miss the sack, I think I’m just going to go get it myself.”</p>

      <p>He quipped, “A lot of those guys are mad at me. It’s all love.”</p>
      <p>Adams’ six sacks are most by a defensive back in the NFL this season.</p>
      <p>Production like this gets safeties paid big bucks. Just look across the field at Landon Collins, who had five interceptions and four sacks with the Giants in 2016 and signed a record-setting six-year, $84 million contract with the Redskins this year despite never matching those numbers.</p>
      <p>“It’s really like a guardian angel-type,” defensive tackle Nathan Shepherd told The Post, “having [Adams] come down and fire off and make plays.”</p>
      <p>Adams said he could take his game to another level after a dominating performance that included a fumble return for a touchdown and two sacks against the Giants. Was this a step in that direction?</p>
      <p>“What do you think?” Adams asked rhetorically. “I just want to continue to get better. That’s what I’m about. Keep elevating and make those around me better.”</p>
      <p>Adams argued with an official over a pass interference penalty against teammate Maurice Canady on a two-point conversion attempt with the Jets leading by 17 points and 1:15 to go in the fourth. He broke up a pass on the redo. In other words, he never took his foot off the gas.</p>
      <p>“He keeps this up,” defensive end Jordan Jenkins said, “he should get AFC Player of the Month.”</p>
      <p>The Jets defense really turned the game when the Redskins managed just three total points after starting back-to-back possessions off turnovers at the Jets’ 16-yard line and 27-yard line. Shepherd dropped Haskins for a 15-yard loss in that period, but there was no question Adams was dictating momentum.</p>
      <p>“It starts with his energy and attitude,” coach Adam Gase said. “You feel him the whole game on the sideline, on the field. Some of the plays he’s making, it’s very impressive. It’s as consistent as you can get, too.”</p>
