      <p>The State government could only abide by the Supreme Court verdict and there was a “de facto” stay on the apex court’s order granting unrestricted entry for women to the Sabarimala Ayyappa temple, Law Minister A.K. Balan has said.</p>
      <p>The Law Minister told reporters on Sunday that a government having constitutional responsibility could act only according to the Supreme Court order.</p>
      <h3>SC stay</h3>
      <p>The moot question is whether the Supreme Court has stayed its earlier order on September 28.</p>
      <p>“De jure there is no stay.... but de facto there is a stay,” he said.</p>
      <p>“The 2018 Supreme Court order has been stayed in effect even though it was not officially mentioned,” the Law Minister added.</p>
