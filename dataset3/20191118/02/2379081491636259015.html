      <h1>Copper eases on slowdown concerns; market eyes U.S.-China trade deal</h1>

      <p>SINGAPORE — London copper prices edged</p>
      <p>lower on Monday as concerns over an economic slowdown in top</p>
      <p>consumer China weighed on the market, although hopes of a</p>
      <p>Sino-U.S. trade deal kept investor optimism afloat, curbing</p>
      <p>sharp declines in the metal.</p>
      <p>FUNDAMENTALS</p>
      <p>* Three-month copper on the London Metal Exchange</p>
      <p>was down 0.2% at $5,840 a tonne, as of 0129 GMT, giving up some</p>
      <p>of previous session’s gains.</p>
      <p>* The most-traded copper contract on the Shanghai Futures</p>
      <p>Exchange was down 0.02% at 46,860 yuan ($6,699.93) a</p>
      <p>tonne.</p>
      <p>* China’s industrial output grew significantly more slowly</p>
      <p>than expected in October, underlining fears of a sharp drop in</p>
      <p>demand in the world’s largest consumer of metals.</p>
      <p>* China’s central bank is expected to cut a key interest</p>
      <p>rate after it extended 200 billion yuan through its medium-term</p>
      <p>lending facility on Friday.</p>
      <p>* Positive comments on trade from officials in Washington</p>
      <p>and Beijing are expected to provide a floor under the market.</p>
      <p>* On Saturday, Chinese state media said the two sides had</p>
      <p>“constructive talks” on trade in a high-level phone call that</p>
      <p>included Vice Premier Liu He, U.S. trade representative Robert</p>
      <p>Lighthizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.</p>
      <p>* White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Thursday</p>
      <p>the nations are getting close to an agreement, citing what he</p>
      <p>called very constructive talks with Beijing about ending a</p>
      <p>16-month trade war.</p>
      <p>* The tariff war has hampered global economic activity and</p>
      <p>pushed metals prices sharply lower.</p>
      <p>* China’s October refined copper output rose 17.9%</p>
      <p>year-on-year to a record high of 868,000 tonnes. Production of</p>
      <p>lead, zinc and alumina also advanced.</p>
      <p>* Japan’s Marubeni Corp said aluminum stocks held at three</p>
      <p>major Japanese ports at the end of October fell 2.6% to 318,200</p>
      <p>tonnes from the previous month.</p>
      <p>* Headline aluminum inventories in LME-registered</p>
      <p>warehouses rose by 44,200 tonnes to a little under 1.1 million</p>
      <p>tonnes, the highest since June.</p>

      <p>* Asian share markets got the week off to a muted start on</p>
      <p>Monday as jaded investors awaited real evidence on progress in</p>
      <p>the U.S.-China trade dispute, though sentiment found support</p>
      <p>from another record close on Wall Street.</p>
