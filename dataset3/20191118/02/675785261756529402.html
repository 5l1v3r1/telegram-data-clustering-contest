      <h2>Ella Gayle and Christian Henman, from Nottingham, have been asked if their child was swapped at birth because of his fair skin and red hair</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T02:32:42+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 02:32</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Dresch, Niamh Shackleton, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matthew-dresch/</a></address>
      <p>A mixed raced mum has been asked if her child was 'swapped at birth' because of his red hair and fair skin.</p>
      <p>Ella Gayle, 23, who has jet black hair, was shocked when Luca, now seven months old, was born with red locks.</p>
      <p>Luca's dad, Christian Henman, 29, is white but also has dark hair - leaving the pair to question where the baby, who has blue eyes, got his look from.</p>
      <p>Ella, a financial difficulty adviser from Nottingham, said: "You can see Luca's hair from a mile off when we're out and about and people often stare because the two of us look so different.</p>

      <p>"Luca's dad has blue eyes like him, but other than that, there's not a huge amount of physical similarity between Luca and us.</p>
      <p>"People have jokingly asked if Luca was swapped at hospital and we were given the wrong baby but I had a home birth so that isn't actually possible."</p>
      <p>Following Luca being born, Ella, who has Jamaican, Italian and Irish heritage, has done more research and discovered that both she and Christian must carry the red hair gene.</p>

      <p>Ella added: "I have two cousins with red hair, but that's the only immediate family both Christian and I have with red hair - other than that, there's no one.</p>
      <p>"People are forever coming up to us when we're out to comment on Luca's amazing hair; it's mainly abroad when I get funny looks from people about the obvious difference in looks between us.</p>
      <p>"I don't mind people staring to be honest, I love to show Luca off.</p>

      <p>It comes after a mixed-race couple said they were forced to leave Ireland after receiving abuse online and even death threats against their toddler son following their appearance in a Lidl advert.</p>
      <p>Fiona Ryan, 33, and her fiance Jonathan Mathis, 32, have been targeted by abuse since they appeared in an ad campaign for the supermarket chain along with their 22-month-old boy.</p>

      <p>The family's inclusion in the ads, which began appearing on billboards and TV in Ireland in early September, saw the couple targeted in an online campaign to boycott Lidl.</p>
      <p>Ms Ryan told RTE's Late Late Show on Friday night the family had decided to move to England after receiving abusive and racist comments online - including a death threat directed at their toddler, the  <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/couple-in-ad-campaign-decide-to-leave-ireland-after-online-abuse-1.4041612">Irish Times</a>  reports.</p>
      <p>She said online abusers were writing vitriol about them on  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a>  and  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a>  and trying to contact their accounts.</p>
