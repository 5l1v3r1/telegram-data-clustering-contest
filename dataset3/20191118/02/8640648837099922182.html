      <p>OAKLAND, Calif. — The Raiders called in reinforcements this week for a defensive unit ravaged by injury.</p>
      <p>Safety D.J. Swearinger and defensive end Dion Jordan paid immediate dividends in <a href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/sports/raiders/raiders-defeat-cincinnati-bengals-17-10-1894935/">Sunday’s 17-10 home win</a> over the Bengals just a week after signing with the organization.</p>
      <p>The Raiders made use of the extra days off since playing last Thursday night against the Chargers. They added both players to the roster and incorporated them in the gameplan.</p>
      <p>Swearinger, who had been a free agent since he was released by Arizona in September, started at safety and led the team with seven tackles.</p>
      <p>“I felt great, especially with what they asked of me,” said Swearinger, who saw most of his action on early downs. “It was similar to what I ran in Arizona so that really helped me with the terminology and to adapt quickly.”</p>
      <p>Arizona defensive coordinator Vance Joseph was a defensive backs coach in Cincinnati in 2014 and 2015 when Raiders defensive coordinator Paul Guenther ran the Bengals defense.</p>
      <p>Jordan recorded a sack and a hurry in his first game of the season. He missed the first 10 weeks while serving a suspension after testing positive for Adderall while with the Seahawks. The Raiders signed him last weekend just prior to Jordan becoming eligible again on Tuesday.</p>
      <p>He was used primarily as a pass-rush specialist on Sunday.</p>
      <p>“I had a ton of fun,” the 29-year-old San Francisco native said. “I had a blast going out there with these guys. I feel like the defensive line as a whole did a good job getting after the quarterback. To be in the Bay Area and do it with these dudes was dope. Hopefully I can start helping more on first and second downs, too.”</p>
      <p>Jordan was disappointed in a neutral-zone infraction that cost his team five yards in the first half, but excited he was able to get to Cincinnati quarterback Ryan Finley for a sack during the third quarter.</p>
      <p>“It was like getting a monkey off my back,” he said. “(The penalty) was just being undisciplined. But I was able to put it behind me and just kind of keep going.”</p>
      <p>Both players credited their teammates and the coaching staff for easing the transition process and helping them be ready to play right away.</p>
      <p>“I came in and met with the coaches over the weekend when I got here and just made sure I studied every night,” Swearinger said. “We got great results.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been loving Jon Gruden for awhile. I appreciate everything about this organization and this locker room and I’m ready to go to war with them any time I get a chance. I’m excited to do anything I can to help them win a championship.”</p>
