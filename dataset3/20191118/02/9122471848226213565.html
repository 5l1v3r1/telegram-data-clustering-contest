      <h1>When QB Tua Tagovailoa Is Expected To Be Able To Play Again</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T02:25:43+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 02:25</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thespun.com/author/aholleran" target="_blank">Andrew Holleran</a></address>
      <p>Tua Tagovailoa won’t be playing for Alabama again this season. The Crimson Tide quarterback reportedly could be playing football by the time the 2020 season arrives, though.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.al.com/alabamafootball/2019/11/tua-tagovailoa-being-flown-to-houston-for-hip-surgery.html">AL.com’s Matt Zenitz reports</a> that Tagovailoa is expected to recover from his hip injury in six to eight months. He reportedly has a “good chance” at playing next season.</p>
      <p>Tagovailoa is expected to declare for the 2020 NFL Draft, though it’s possible this injury could affect his plans.</p>
      <blockquote>Tagovailoa has a good shot at being cleared to return to football activities in six-to-eight months and a good chance of playing football next season, according to sources with knowledge of the situation. It’s a positive outlook after initial comparisons to the injury that ended former Auburn star Bo Jackson’s career.</blockquote>
      <p>Alabama announced Sunday evening that Tagovailoa will undergo surgery on Monday.</p>
      <p>“For the past 24 hours our medical team has consulted with multiple orthopedic experts across the country, who specialize in hip injuries and surgeries,” orthopedist Dr. Lyle Cain announced. “Based on that research, Tua is being flown to Houston tonight to be evaluated and is scheduled to have hip surgery Monday. As previously stated, we anticipate a full recovery. The main focus has been, and will remain, on Tua, his family, and making sure we are providing them the best medical care possible.”</p>
      <p>Alabama players visited Tagovailoa in the hospital on Sunday afternoon.</p>
