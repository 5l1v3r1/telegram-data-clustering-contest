      <p>LUCKNOW, India: Teenage opener Rahmanullah Gurbaz hit an attacking half-century to set up Afghanistan's 29-run series-clinching win over West Indies in the third Twenty20 international on Sunday (Nov 17).</p>
      <p>Gurbaz hit 79 off 52 balls as Afghanistan posted 156 for eight, a total their bowlers defended by restricting the West Indies to 127-7 in Lucknow.</p>

      <p>They won the series 2-1 after losing the opening game and being swept in the preceding ODIs 3-0.</p>
      <p>Paceman Naveen-ul-Haq took three wickets to choke the West Indies' chase despite a valiant 52 by wicketkeeper-batsman Shai Hope.</p>
      <p>"You have to be smart and cool and calm as a professional player. Sometimes you are losing but your energy and mindset for upcoming matches is more important," said skipper Rashid Khan.</p>
      <p>"Yes we lost the first three ODIs and the first T20 but still the focus was that we can still win two trophies - T20s and Test cricket."</p>
      <p>But it was the 17-year-old Gurbaz, a wicketkeeper-batsman, who stood out with his second T20I fifty after the Afghans were in early trouble at 12 for two.</p>
      <p>Gurbaz, named man of the match, put on a crucial 50-run stand for the fourth wicket with former captain Asghar Afghan, who made 24, and surpassed his previous T20I best of 61.</p>
      <p>He smashed six fours and five sixes before falling to West Indies skipper Kieron Pollard.</p>
      <p>Pacemen Sheldon Cottrell, Kesrick Williams and Keemo Paul took two wickets each.</p>
      <p>The West Indies lost regular wickets to falter in their chase against a disciplined Afghanistan attack that made the most of a slow track.</p>
      <p>Hope, who was dropped on 11 by Naveen off Gulbadin Naib, completed his second T20I fifty but got little support from the other end.</p>
      <p>Bowling all-rounder Karim Janat could not repeat his heroics from the second game where he claimed five wickets and scored 26 runs, but was named man of the series.</p>
      <p>"The guys would have taken a lot from this series and how to adapt and play on slower pitches," said Pollard.</p>
      <p>"We have a long-term plan, but we have to deal with what's in front of us right now. Can't say what will happen in October next year (for the T20 World Cup)."</p>
      <p>The two teams will next play a one-off Test starting Nov 27.</p>
