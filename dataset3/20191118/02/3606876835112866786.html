        <b>Get ready, because you're about to take the equivalent to an adventurous <a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/relationships/a19994103/best-couples-retreats-2019/">mountain getaway </a>right in your own backyard. We found a DIY tiny house that might persuade you to leave your regular home and post up in your mini guest house for a long weekend. Its like a Swiss-style cozy ski cabin that you can stay in without actually having to do the skiing.</b>

      <p>As tiny as the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Allwood-Timberline-483-SQF-Cabin/dp/B00M8R8GH2/ref=sr_1_16?keywords=allwood+tiny+house&amp;qid=1573226862&amp;sr=8-16">Allwood Timberline </a>house is, there are quite a few separate rooms that will give guests optimal personal space. First, on the 354-square-foot main level, theres a little sitting room in the foyer, perfect for lounging and <a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/a21254077/best-self-help-books-for-women/">reading your favorite motivational book </a>. Then, once you enter the main part of the house, you can create a little combo dining-living room that can comfortably fit both a sofa and a kitchen table for four.</p>
      <p>Off the main room, theres a small bathroom and bedroom. And above that, theres a 129-square-foot lofted bedroom to sleep a couple more guests. (Amazon's listing shows twin futons facing each other for fun sleepovers in the little cabins loft).</p>
      <p>The porch out front is a quaint addition, where you can put a little wood table and chairs out there to sip your <a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/food/a29033809/healthy-coffee/">coffee </a>, have a <a href="https://www.womenshealthmag.com/weight-loss/a19989705/healthy-breakfast-ideas/">healthy breakfast </a>, and ponder life's big questions on warmer mornings.</p>
      <p>This picturesque, slanted-roof guest cabin does come at a price. And that price is *holds breath* $34,900. But think about it: If you have frequent out-of-town family members or pals visiting, youre saving by not having to put them up in a hotel every time. Plus, they have their own space to unwind and feel at home.</p>
      <p>Building this tiny home would be the cutest, coziest addition to your yard. Maybe start saving up now in a special cabin fund?</p>
