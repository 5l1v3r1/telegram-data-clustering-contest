      <p><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/kelly-ripa/">Kelly Ripa</a> delighted her Instagram fans earlier today with a rare, mini-family reunion photo. As those who follow the blond-haired beauty on Instagram know, Ripa is no stranger to sharing glimpses into all aspects of her life on her social media page. In the most recent image that was shared for her fans, the talk show host combined work and pleasure in a stunning new snapshot.</p>
      <p>In the caption of the image, Ripa told her fans that she was in Las Vegas, where she is shooting her hit show, <i>Live With Kelly and Ryan</i> while revealing that she has been having a good time with her dad and her Uncle Romeo. The mother of three was all smiles as she stood in the middle of the two men, striking a pose. Ripa wore her long, blond locks down and slightly waved while also sporting a stunning application of makeup that included eyeliner, mascara, blush, highlighter, and lipstick.</p>
      <p>Kelly accessorized the look with a number of necklaces and showed off her flawless figure in a pair of light wash jeans, a black tank top, and a black blazer on top. To her left, stood her dad who was also all smiles for the camera. He looked dressed to impress in a khaki-colored jacket, khaki pants, and a striped polo. On her other side stood Ripa’s Uncle Romeo, who rocked a teal shirt with a white button-down on top and a pair of dark pants.</p>
