      <p>KUALA LUMPUR (Nov 18): The FBM KLCI traded muted at mid-morning as key blue chips including Tenaga Nasional Bhd and Public Bank Bhd dragged.</p>
      <p>At 10am, the FBM KLCI dipped 1.07 points to 1,593.68. The index had earlier climbed to a high of 1,595.29.</p>
      <p>The decliners overtook advancers by 233 to 224, while 314 counters traded unchanged. Volume was 545.28 million shares valued at RM206.69 million.</p>
      <p>The top losers included British American Tobacco (M) Bhd, Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd, United Plantations Bhd, Tenaga, Batu Kawan Bhd, Hong Leong Bank Bhd, Public Bank and IGB Bhd.</p>
      <p>The actives included Trive Property Group Bhd, NetX Holdings Bhd, Bumi Armada Bhd, Sapura Energy Bhd, Velesto Energy Bhd and PUC Bhd.</p>
      <p>The gainers included Nestle (M) Bhd, ATA IMS Bhd, Master-Pack Group Bhd, Negri Sembilan Oil Palms Bhd, PPB Group Bhd, IHH Healthcare Bhd, Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd, Digi.Com Bhd, UWC Bhd and Petra Energy Bhd.</p>
      <p><i>Reuters </i>reported that Asian share markets got the week off to a muted start on Monday as jaded investors awaited real evidence on progress in the US-China trade dispute, though sentiment found support from another record close on Wall Street.</p>
      <p>MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dipped 0.06% in very light volumes, it said.</p>
      <p>Hong Leong IB Research said investors were pushing Wall Street towards the all-time-high region over the past few weeks in the anticipation a phase one mini deal will go through, supported by recent positive economic data and upbeat US 3Q19 reporting season as the S&amp;P 500 earnings is expected to fall only around 1.8% year-on-year from the 4.9% drop before the start of the earnings season.</p>
      <p>"Nevertheless, without any solid details at this juncture until the signing of the agreement coupled with overbought levels, the Dow is likely to remain event-driven with formidable resistance near 28,500. Key supports are located [at] 27,600/27,300," it said.</p>
      <p>"Despite bullish Wall Street, local sentiment is likely to stay cautious amid the ongoing November reporting season.</p>
      <p>"Nevertheless, with the positive comments from US economic adviser, it may support the overall sentiment. Hence, the KLCI may trend sideways for the near term. Support is set around 1,581-1,586 levels, while stiff resistances seems located around 1,603-1,614," it said.</p>
