      <h1>Google Stadia nearly doubles launch lineup to 22 games on eve of debut</h1>
      <h2>The cloud gaming service looks a little more appealing</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T02:19:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 02:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/sean-hollister" target="_blank">Sean Hollister</a></address>
      <p>Google’s Stadia cloud gaming service is just two days away from launch — a launch that’s taken some serious criticism (including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/14/20964386/google-stadia-pre-launch-editorial-cloud-gaming">from yours truly at <i>The Verge</i></a>)<i> </i>because the company keeps revealing that most of the service’s promised features and games won’t be ready. But now, Google has given its early adopters a welcome surprise for a change: 22 games will be ready to play on day one, nearly <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/6/18655380/google-stadia-games-list-cloud-streaming-service-e3-2019">double the number that Google said would be available</a> as of last week.</p>
      <p>Some of these titles weren’t slated to arrive until 2020 by Google’s last estimate, but Stadia boss Phil Harrison replied to one of my tweets with this explanation:</p>

      <p>Here’s the revised launch list of titles the company just shared on Sunday evening, with newly added ones in bold:</p>

        <li>Assassin’s Creed Odyssey</li>
        <li>

        <li>Red Dead Redemption 2</li>
        <li>Samurai Shodown (available in Stadia Pro)</li>
        <li>Shadow of the Tomb Raider</li>
        <li>Thumper</li>
        <li>Tomb Raider 2013</li>
        <li>
          <b>Trials Rising</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Wolfenstein: Youngblood</b>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>In addition, <i>Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Breakpoint</i>, a title that was previously slated for 2020, will now arrive by the end of 2019 instead; and <i>Doom: Eternal, Watch Dogs: Legion, Gods &amp; Monsters, and Cyberpunk 2077 </i>are now all now officially confirmed for Stadia release in 2020. You can see <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/6/18655380/google-stadia-games-list-cloud-streaming-service-e3-2019">the updated release slate here</a>.</p>
      <p>Google also says that <i>Samurai Showdown</i> will now be available free of charge to Stadia Pro subscribers at launch — previously, <i>Destiny 2</i> was the only title free to play with that subscription. Generally, Stadia requires you to buy games, with the $10/month Stadia Pro tier allowing you to play them at higher 4K resolution, with HDR support, instead of the free 1080p tier that’ll be rolling out in 2020.</p>
      <p>The company has also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/6/18655380/google-stadia-games-list-cloud-streaming-service-e3-2019">announced additional games</a> that will arrive on Stadia by the end of the year and into 2020, but until this evening, the launch lineup felt quite small — especially considering that Microsoft’s rival xCloud service <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/14/20964411/microsoft-project-xcloud-new-games-list-50-games-support">already has 50 titles live</a> despite still being in early preview.</p>
