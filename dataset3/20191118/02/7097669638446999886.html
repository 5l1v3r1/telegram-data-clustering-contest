      <h1>This Cold War Stealth Bomber Almost Flew From U.S. Navy Aircraft Carriers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T02:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 02:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://nationalinterest.org/" target="_blank">TNI Staff</a></address>
      <p><b>Key point: </b>The Navy lacks a heavy-hitting, long-range bomber platform.</p>
      <p>During the closing stages of the Cold War, the United States Navy was developing a new long-range stealth bomber that could strike at even the most heavily defended targets from the deck of an aircraft carrier. But the ill-fated program was cancelled; leaving a gap in naval aviation capability that has not been filled to this day.  </p>
      <p>Called the McDonnell Douglas/General Dynamics<a href="https://www.usni.org/magazines/navalhistory/2018-02/historic-aircraft-avenger-couldn%E2%80%99t-avenge"> A-12 Avenger II</a>—a product of the Advanced Tactical Aircraft (ATA) program—the new bomber would have replaced the long-serving Grumman A-6E Intruder. However, as the Soviet threat evaporated, then Defense Secretary Dick Cheney<a href="http://www.airforcemag.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/1991/April%201991/0491navy.aspx"> cancelled</a> the A-12 program on January 7, 1991, due to massive cost and schedule overruns as well as severe technical problems. But while the stealthy A-12 had its problems, the bomber’s demise led the Navy to today’s problem: A carrier air wing that does not have the range or penetrating strike capability to<a href="http://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/how-navy-would-destroy-chinese-aircraft-carrier-24927"> defeat advanced anti-access/area-denial (A2/AD) capabilities.</a></p>
