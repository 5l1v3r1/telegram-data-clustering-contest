      <p>The man who pulled a gun on police in a Surfers Paradise car park has been sentenced to nine years in jail.</p>
      <p>29-year-old Daniel White Mayne was initially charged with attempted murder, for threatening to shoot at two police officers in the car park of the Solaire apartments back in January 2017.</p>
      <p>Two officers were responding to reports of a suspicious looking vehicle, when they saw White Mayne carrying a bag that he then quickly threw into a bin.</p>
      <p>Though when officers approached, he grabbed a revolver from the bag and threatened to shoot them.</p>
      <p>An officer then discharged multiple shots – one of them striking White Mayne in his scrotum, the other in his thigh.</p>
      <p>He then returned fire, with a fragment of a bullet striking the officer.</p>
      <p>White Mayne was acquitted of the murder charge earlier this year, instead being found guilty of attempting to strike a police officer with a projectile in attempt to resist arrest.</p>
      <p>This morning, he was sentenced to nine years behind bars, though will be eligible for parole in January 2021.</p>
