      <p>LUXEMBOURG: Portugal captain Cristiano Ronaldo slammed Luxembourg's pitch as a "potato field" and also said he had not been fully fit in recent matches after the European champions won 2-0 on Sunday to qualify for Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo scored his 99th Portugal goal late in the game, having notched a hat-trick in a 6-0 win over Lithuania three days earlier, but it was far from a vintage performance on a pitch full of divots at the Josy Barthel stadium.</p>

      <p>"It's difficult to play on these pitches - it was a potato field, I don't know how teams of our level are supposed to play on these pitches," he told reporters.</p>
      <p>"It wasn't a good spectacle but we did our job... I'm looking forward to my fifth European Championship."</p>
      <p>The 34-year-old had joined up with the Portugal squad amid speculation over his fitness and attitude following his angry reaction to being substituted during Juventus' 1-0 win over AC Milan the previous Sunday.</p>
      <p>Juve coach Maurizio Sarri then said that Ronaldo had been struggling with a knee problem for some time.</p>
      <p>"In the last three weeks, I have been playing with limitations," Ronaldo told a group of reporters outside Portugal's dressing-room door on Sunday. "But there was no controversy - you (the media) created that.</p>
      <p>"I tried to help Juventus. Nobody likes to be substituted but I understood because I wasn't in such good shape," he added.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo said he was also "not 100 percent" in the two Portugal matches.</p>
      <p>"I sacrificed myself for the team," he said. "We could have missed out (on Euro 2020). Thankfully, I haven't been injured much in my career but it can happen."</p>
      <p>"It's a pain that prevents me from being 100 percent, but I always try to play. They created a big controversy where it didn't need to exist. I'll be back to 100 percent soon."</p>
      <p>Portugal finished second in Group B with 17 points, three ahead of Serbia who drew 2-2 with Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo would become only the second player to score 100 goals by reaching that milestone.</p>
      <p>"The 100th goal will come naturally," he said. "Records are there to be beaten and I am going to beat them."</p>
