      <h1>Vinnie Vincent Offers $250 ‘Speedball Jamm’ CD Re-Release</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T02:23:39+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 02:23</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Wilkening</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/vinnie-vincent/">Vinnie Vincent</a> has announced a staggeringly expensive re-release of his 2002 instrumental album <i>Speedball Jamm</i>.</p>
      <p>The CD is <a href="http://vinnievincent.com/product/vinnie-vincent-speedball-jamm/">available for pre-order</a> on the former <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/kiss/">Kiss</a> guitarist's website for $250. The listing makes no mention of bonus tracks or deluxe packaging, but does promise purchasers will also receive a limited-edition autographed 8"x10" photo and a "big" guitar pick. It also states that the discs will ship in February 2020.</p>
      <p>Julian Gill of<i> Kiss FAQ</i> (via <a href="https://www.kiss-related-recordings.nl/vinnievincent_speedball.html">Kiss Related Recordings</a>) describes the 71-minute <i>Speedball Jamm</i> as "an analog transfer of a Vinnie warm-up session, with some very wild shredding."</p>
      <p>The fact that discs aren't ready to ship yet could cause flashbacks for fans who say they were burned by Vincent after sending him <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/the-long-kiss-goodbye-the-search-for-vinnie-vincent-187427/">between $120 and $300</a> for the planned but never delivered 1997 six-cassette box set <a href="https://www.kiss-related-recordings.nl/vinnievincent_archives.html"><i>The Vinnie Vincent Archives</i></a>.</p>
      <p>Vincent performed a<i> Speedball Jamm</i>-themed birthday bash at S.I.R. studios in Nashville back in August, and has announced <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/vinnie-vincent-merry-metal-christmas/">a two-day Merry Metal Christmas event</a> at the same venue for Dec. 14 and 15.</p>
      <p>After nearly two decades out of the public eye, Vincent <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/vinnie-vincent-return-things-we-learned/">resurfaced in January 2018</a>. Six months later he announced a <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/vinnie-vincent-2018-concert/">comeback concert</a>, which was <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/vinnie-vincent-postpones-first-full-length-concerts-in-30-years/">postponed</a> and then <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/vinnie-vincent-cancels-comeback-shows/">canceled</a> amid much <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/vinnie-vincent-canceled-comeback/">finger</a>-<a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/vinnie-vincent-canceled-comeback-shows/">pointing</a>. Since his return, in addition to the birthday event, Vincent has shared the stage with both<a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/watch-vinnie-vincent-reunite-with-gene-simmons-on-stage/"> Gene Simmons</a> and <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/vinnie-vincent-kiss-songs-live/">Four by Fate</a>.</p>

      <h3>Kiss Lineup Changes: A Complete Guide</h3>

      <h4>1973-1980: Gene Simmons / Paul Stanley / Peter Criss / Ace Frehley</h4>
      <p>The band's classic lineup coalesced in 1973, following the dissolution of <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/gene-simmons/">Gene Simmons</a> and <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/paul-stanley/">Paul Stanley</a>'s previous group, Wicked Lester. Seeking to adopt a harder-edged sound (and experiment with a more image-driven approach), Simmons and Stanley recruited drummer <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/peter-criss/">Peter Criss</a> and guitarist Ace Frehley to form Kiss in early 1973; by year's end, they were the first act signed to Casablanca Records, the label with which they'd record arguably their best albums. Success didn't come right away, however -- in fact, Casablanca was on the verge of bankruptcy by 1975, when Kiss released its first double live LP, 'Alive!,' which went gold and kicked off a string of bestselling releases that lasted through the rest of the decade.</p>

      <h4>1980-1982: Gene Simmons / Paul Stanley / Ace Frehley / Eric Carr</h4>
      <p>The late '70s found Kiss derailing their momentum both creatively -- with a series of ill-advised solo albums, all released on the same day, and the poorly received 'Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Park' TV special -- as well as personally, as artistic differences and substance abuse drove the band members apart. Criss, who was largely absent from 1979's 'Dynasty' album due to injuries suffered in a car accident, found himself on the outside again during the sessions for 1980's 'Unmasked' LP; shortly after its release, the band officially announced his departure and replacement with new drummer <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/eric-carr/">Eric Carr</a>.</p>

      <h4>1982-1984: Gene Simmons / Paul Stanley / Eric Carr / Vinnie Vincent</h4>
      <p>Ace Frehley was the next to go, one of the many casualties of the band's ill-advised 1981 album 'Music From 'The Elder.'' Dissatisfied with their artistic direction and disenfranchised by a series of band decisions that saw him outvoted by Simmons and Stanley, Frehley opted to remain almost entirely on the sidelines for 'The Elder,' taping his guitar contributions at home and contributing lead vocals to only one song. When it came time for Kiss to fulfill their (extremely limited) promotional obligations for the record, Frehley was mostly absent -- and although the band delayed the announcement of his departure, even going so far as to picture him on the covers of the 'Killers' and 'Creatures of the Night' LPs in 1982, he was gone by the summer of that year. In December, Kiss announced that Frehley had been replaced by <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/vinnie-vincent/">Vinnie Vincent</a>, but trouble was already on the horizon.</p>

      <h4>1983: The Makeup Comes Off</h4>
      <p>The release of Kiss' first (and only) album with Vinnie Vincent officially in the guitarist spot coincided with another big event: the removal of the band's trademark face paint. Simmons said Stanley had to talk him into the change: “‘Let’s prove something to the fans,’ Paul said, ‘Let’s go and be a real band without makeup.’ I reluctantly agreed. I didn’t know if it was going to work, but I heard what Paul was saying — there was nowhere else for us to go."</p>

      <h4>1984: Gene Simmons / Paul Stanley / Eric Carr / Mark St. John</h4>
      <p>While Vinnie Vincent may have been a strong contributor to Kiss -- he's credited as a co-writer on the bulk of 1983's 'Lick It Up' album -- it's putting things politely to say he didn't get along with Simmons and Stanley during his brief, bumpy tenure with the band. By the spring of 1984, Vincent was gone for good (although he'd briefly return to the songwriting fold in the early '90s, co-writing three songs from the 1992 release 'Revenge'), and when the group unveiled the 'Animalize' LP in September of that year, his spot had been taken by Mark St. John. Sadly, although the album ended up being one of the band's commercial high points during the decade, St. John's tenure would also be short-lived.</p>

      <h4>1984-1991: Gene Simmons / Paul Stanley / Eric Carr / Bruce Kulick</h4>
      <p>Shortly after joining Kiss, Mark St. John was stricken with reactive arthritis, the symptoms of which prevented him from reliably playing and forced the band to find a fill-in for its live shows. Enter <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/bruce-kulick/">Bruce Kulick</a>, who officially took over the position in December 1984 -- and helped cement the Kiss lineup for the rest of the decade, quieting years of personnel turbulence just as the band started to reassert itself as a commercial force. While they didn't recapture the dizzy heights of the group's '70s releases, the next few Kiss records -- 1985's 'Asylum,' 1987's 'Crazy Nights' and 1989's 'Hot in the Shade' -- found the band comfortably ensconced in the upper echelon of rock's biggest acts.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>1992-1996: Gene Simmons / Paul Stanley / Bruce Kulick / Eric Singer</h4>
      <p>By 1991, Kiss were ready to follow up 'Hot in the Shade,' but just as sessions were getting underway in the spring, doctors discovered a tumor on Eric Carr's heart -- the start of a scary medical odyssey that would end on Nov. 24, 1991, when Carr died at the age of 41. Although devastated, Carr's bandmates carried on, enlisting new drummer Eric Singer to join them while they finished recording what would ultimately become 1992's 'Revenge' album. While it wasn't one of the band's most radio-friendly efforts, it was hailed as a return to form by many fans, and continued their string of gold and platinum releases, and presaged a period of commercial and cultural reappraisal for the group that included an all-star tribute album and a well-received 1995 appearance on 'MTV Unplugged' that featured cameos by Ace Frehley and Peter Criss.</p>

      <h4>1996-2001: Gene Simmons / Paul Stanley / Peter Criss / Ace Frehley</h4>
      <p>The apparent end of Criss and Frehley's long-running feud with Simmons and Stanley sparked rumors that a full-on reunion was in the works, and as it turned out, they weren't far from the truth; although Bruce Kulick and Eric Singer remained in the fold until early 1996, tracking their parts for what would eventually form the long-delayed 'Carnival of Souls' album, by late February, negotiations were complete for Criss and Frehley's official return, and in April, the reunited foursome announced plans for a world tour. While the fans' enthusiasm was palpable -- Kiss went down as the top-earning live act of the year -- the passage of time hadn't really done much to smooth things over between the reconstituted lineup, and while they managed to keep it together for 1998's 'Psycho Circus' record, the seeds of dissension were already blooming.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>2001-2002: Gene Simmons / Paul Stanley / Ace Frehley / Eric Singer</h4>
      <p>After five years of relative public harmony, Peter Criss had had enough, departing Kiss one more time over a contract dispute and being replaced by Eric Singer -- who, in a move that many fans deemed disrespectful, donned Criss' Cat Man makeup for his portion of what was then being billed as the band's farewell tour. By this time, Kiss had evolved into primarily a live band and merchandising center, with its sole major musical output of 2001 coming in the form of a five-CD box set.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>2002: Gene Simmons / Paul Stanley / Eric Singer/ Tommy Thayer</h4>
      <p>Twenty years after following Peter Criss out of the Kiss lineup, Ace Frehley repeated his decision in 2002 -- and just as Criss had seen Eric Singer assume his iconic persona on stage, So did Frehley witness his replacement, Tommy Thayer, don his makeup and costume for the tour. While some fans surely didn't notice the change (which was obviously the point), others took it as an affront.</p>

      </figure>
      <h4>2003: Gene Simmons / Paul Stanley / Peter Criss / Tommy Thayer</h4>
      <p>Just when it seemed like Peter Criss' history with Kiss couldn't get any stormier, it did: In February 2003, he returned to the lineup for another round of tour dates, joining Simmons, Stanley and Thayer for the recording of another live album, 'Kiss Symphony: Alive IV,' and anchoring the rhythm section for a top-grossing run of shows with <a href="https://ultimateclassicrock.com/tags/aerosmith/">Aerosmith</a>. But by March of the following year, he was out again -- and this time, since he was no longer a full member of the group, all Simmons and Stanley reportedly had to do was opt not to renew his contract. When the band hit the road for its summer tour with Poison, Singer was back in the drummer's seat.</p>

      <h4>2004-Present: Gene Simmons / Paul Stanley / Tommy Thayer / Eric Singer</h4>
      <p>Kiss have weathered more than their share of personnel changes, but the band continued deep into the new millennium – when they announced a(nother) final tour. Longtime fans may be disappointed with Peter Criss and Ace Frehley's (presumably permanent) absence from the lineup, but they still turned out in droves for the band's most recent studio releases, 2009's 'Sonic Boom' and 2012's 'Monster.' As for what's ahead? This final tour was set to begin some 19 years after Kiss staged their first farewell trip.</p>
