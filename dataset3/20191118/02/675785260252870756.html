      <h1>Prince Andrew interview and Harry rows 'show Queen has lost control of her family'</h1>
      <h2>Royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell claims the Queen's advisers were not consulted about Prince Andrew's Saturday's BBC Newsnight interview</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T02:04:45+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 02:04</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Dresch, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matthew-dresch/</a></address>
      <p>The Queen no longer has 'strong central control' of her family, according to the BBC's royal correspondent.</p>
      <p>Nicholas Witchell claims Prince Harry's recent attack on the tabloid press and Prince Andrew's Jeffrey Epstein disastrous interview this weekend showed a 'lack of strong central control' in the royal family.</p>
      <p>He claimed the Queen's advisers were not consulted over the Duke of York's BBC Newsnight interview, in which he addressed his relationship with his paedophile former pal Epstein.</p>
      <p>The journalist said: "The Queen was informed but she is 93 years old now, and she is not exercising the strong control she had, if she ever did.</p>

      <p>"We have had two episodes within just a couple of months, of senior members of the royal family doing it their way.</p>
      <p>"We had <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/prince-harry">Prince Harry</a> with his rant against the tabloid media which was absolutely against the advice of his communications officials who were in despair over it.</p>
      <p>“We have a similar situation now. The mainstream advisors of the Queen at the Palace were not a part of this Prince Andrew debate.”</p>
      <p>Mr Witchell - once called 'an awful man' by Prince Charles - claims the Queen would have asked her second son 'are you sure' if he told her about his interview plan.</p>
      <p>He added that the Duke discussed the Newsnight sit down with his daughters and close advisers.</p>
      <p>According to the <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/1205571/Prince-Andrew-interview-Queen-Elizabeth-BBC-Epstein-latest-news">Express</a>, ex-Buckingham Palace press officer Dickie Arbiter described Prince Andrew's interview on Saturday night as 'excruciating'.</p>

      <p>There are conflicting reports over whether the Duke received his mother's permission to go ahead with the interview.</p>
      <p>Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis believed the monarch signed off on the interview after he sought 'approval from higher up'.</p>
      <p>However, sources previously told the Express that while the Queen was “aware” of his interview, she had not approved it.</p>

      <p>Pressure mounted on the Duke to address his friendship with Epstein after the billionaire financier was arrested on sex trafficking charges in July and killed himself in prison in August.</p>
      <p>One of Epstein's victims, Virginia Roberts - now Giuffre, claimed she had been trafficked to have sex with Prince Andrew three times.</p>
      <p>She said she had sex with the royal when she was 17-years-old.</p>

      <p>The Prince categorically denied having sex with Mrs Giuffre and said he could not even remember meeting her. </p>
      <p>He also denied recalling the infamous picture of him and Mrs Giuffre cosying up to each other being taken, suggesting it could be a fake.</p>
