        <b>Kylie Jenner may have competition on her hands as her daughter Stormi is officially her father’s mini-me, after wearing braids just like Travis Scott.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The adorable one-year-old spent some quality time with the SICKOMODE rapper on Sunday, giving Kylie a break to catch-up on mum things no doubt.</p>
      <p>Travis, 28, took full advantage of having little Stormi to himself and gave the toddler a make-over with her now sporting box braids similar to his signature look.</p>
      <p>The only difference is Stormi has clear beads at the ends of each plait.</p>
      <p>‘“Daddy’s hair”,’ Travis captioned the sweet snaps suggesting Stormi asked for the style herself or, at least, approved of her new ‘do.</p>
      <p>Not only was Stormi rocking daddy’s look, but she also wore a necklace with ‘Stormi’s World’ on it, a play on Travis’ number one album ASTROWORLD.</p>

      <p>But Kylie, 22, was still close to her daughter’s heart as Stormi also wore a chain with the cosmetic mogul’s name on it.</p>

      <p>Stormi pretty much does live in Stormi World as Kylie and Travis were seen taking the tot to his Astroworld Festival earlier this month.</p>
      <p>Kylie was seen hanging backstage with the tot, who wore large pink headphones while her dad performed on-stage.</p>
      <p>A source told People at the time: ‘Kylie flew to Houston with a group of friends. She returns to L.A. this morning. It was important for her to support Travis’ festival. They are still very close and often hang out with Stormi.’</p>
      <p>It seems Kylie and Travis have mastered the art of co-parenting since their split in October.</p>
      <p>The Keeping Up With the Kardashians star confirmed the end of their two-year relationship but said she and Travis were friends and ‘amicably’ co-parenting Stormi.</p>
      <p>Although an insider recently claimed Kylie ‘considers herself single’, she was romantically linked to Drake this month after attending his 33rd birthday party. An insider said she had been spending time with the God’s Plan rapper but it appears they’re just friends after all.</p>
