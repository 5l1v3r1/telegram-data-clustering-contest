      <p>“Love the song, I really like the song,” Mayer commented, before offering up a slight criticism. “I get a little chuckle because she says, ‘We can keep the Christmas lights up ‘til January.’ And I go, ‘You’re insane. Everyone keeps their Christmas lights up until January.'”</p>

      <p>Mayer soon launched into his own rendition of “Lover” with his own take on the Christmas lights lyric.</p>
      <p>“We can keep the Christmas lights up ‘til January,” he sang. “And then about January 5th, we’ll take the lights down. And then we’ll put ‘em in a box and we’ll label that box Christmas lights. Yeah, we’ll put ‘em in the attic until next December.”</p>
      <p>Also on the show, Mendes’ girlfriend Camila Cabello made a surprise appearance while backstage on the shoot for her “Living Proof” music video.</p>
