      <h1>Buhari congratulates Bayelsa Governor-elect</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T08:02:41+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 08:02</time> by <a rel="author">The Eagle Online</a></address>
      <p>President Muhammadu Buhari has congratulated the All Progressives Congress governorship candidate in the November 16 election in Bayelsa State, David Lyon, on his impressive victory.</p>
      <p>This was contained in a statement signed by presidential spokesman, Femi Adesina, on Monday.</p>
      <p>The statement said President Buhari also commended APC supporters in particular and Nigerians in general in the State who exercised their civic rights in a peaceful manner, notwithstanding the pockets of unrest recorded in some locations.  </p>
      <p>Condemning the loss of lives in Bayelsa, particularly prior to the election, the President commiserated with the families of the victims.</p>
      <p>According to President Buhari: “Violence during elections vitiates our commitment to demonstrate to the world and upcoming generation that we are a people capable of electing leaders in a peaceful and orderly manner.”</p>
      <p>He notes that while officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission and security agencies did their best within the ambit of the law to ensure free, fair and credible elections, it is unfortunate that pockets of unrest, mostly sponsored by desperate politicians, were recorded during the poll.</p>
      <p>The President said he looks forward to working with the incoming government to improve the lives of the people in Bayelsa State, while ensuring the security of lives and property of all citizens.</p>
      <p>President Buhari urged Lyon to carry other divergent interests along in the next phase of governance, imploring those not satisfied with the outcome of the poll to seek redress through the constitutionally established channels.</p>
