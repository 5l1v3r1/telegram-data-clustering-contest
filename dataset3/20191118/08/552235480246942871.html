      <p>A Hamilton man who told police he had every right to carry a knife has avoided jail.</p>
      <p>Officers found a blade when they searched Francis McWhinnie for drugs.</p>
      <p>The 47-year-old, formerly of Argyle Drive, admitted having an offensive weapon in the town’s Glasgow Road on December 18, when he appeared at Hamilton Sheriff Court last week.</p>
      <p>He also admitted breaching bail conditions by returning to the area on July 2.</p>
      <p>Paula Russell, prosecuting, said officers offered to help McWhinnie while out on patrol in Burnbank.</p>
      <p>She said: “He was unsteady on his feet, his speech was slurred and he smelled strongly of cannabis. Officers found a knife in his pocket and he said: ‘That’s OK. I carry that for my own protection’.”</p>
      <p>Defence agent Diarmid Bruce said McWhinnie, now of Crofthead Street, Uddingston, had been abusing alcohol and drugs, but since moving away from Hamilton is doing better.</p>
      <p>Sheriff Thomas Millar put him under supervision for a year after social workers said this would “help his rehabilitation”. He is also confined to his home at night for three months on an electronic tagging order.</p>
