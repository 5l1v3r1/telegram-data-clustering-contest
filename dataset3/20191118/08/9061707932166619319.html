      <h2>Latest Derby County transfer news | The 31-year-old had a sixth-month stint with the Rams but failed to make a single first-team appearance</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T08:38:22+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 08:38</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Wakefield</a></address>
      <p>Former Derby County defender Efe Ambrose is reportedly the subject of two clubs in Scotland</p>
      <p>The experienced centre-back signed for the <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county">Rams </a>on a short-term deal in February as a free agent, shortly after his contract at Hibernian has expired.</p>
      <p>Ambrose was signed as defensive cover to centre-backs Richard Keogh and Fikayo Tomori, but left <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/derby-county-defender-up-there-3547692">Pride Park</a> in the summer without a single first-team appearance to his name.</p>
      <p>Now fresh reports are linking Ambrose with a move to two clubs <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/derby-county-transfer-news-dykes-3548235">north of the border</a>, one of which is his former club Hibs.</p>
      <p>The Daily Mail claim that Hibs are set to battle it out with fellow Scottish Premiership outfit St Johnstone for the 31-year-old’s signature.</p>
      <p>Ambrose made 81 appearances for Hibs before leaving the club in January of this year, and could return less than a year after his departure.</p>

      <p>Hibs have a new manager at the helm as former Sunderland boss Jack Ross was appointed as Paul Heckingbottom replacement last week.</p>
      <p>Ross could dip into the transfer market in January as he looks to take Hibs back up the Scottish Premiership table, with the club currently in eighth place.</p>
