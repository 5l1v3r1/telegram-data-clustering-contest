      <p>MULTAN, Pakistan — Pakistani police say an overloaded, small wooden boat capsized in eastern Punjab province, killing eight passengers and leaving several others missing.</p>
      <p>Local police chief Mohammad Imran says the boat tilted on its side, filled with water and sank on Monday in the Sutlej River near the town of Dibalpur.</p>
      <p>He says most of the 35 passengers were on their way to a funeral when the accident happened. It wasn’t immediately known what caused it.</p>
      <p>Imran says 10 passengers were saved and that a search for the missing is underway.</p>
      <p>Such accidents are common in Pakistan, where wooden boats are often used to transport goods and people on rivers and lakes. Most operate without life jackets.</p>
      <p>Dibalpur is about 250 kilometres, or 150 miles, south of Multan, the nearest big city.</p>
