      <h1>Child poverty numbers in North East working families have soared, says report</h1>
      <h2>Report for TUC reveals that since 2010 the number has risen by 52% causing concern for anti-poverty campaigners</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T08:18:27+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 08:18</time> by <a rel="author">Mike Kelly</a></address>
      <p>There are almost 110,000 North East children in working families living in poverty, a rise of more than 50% since 2010, according to a report published today.</p>
      <p>A decade ago the figure for the region was 71,362 but now it is 108,775, a rise of 37,413 or 52%.</p>
      <p>According to the report, the UK-wide figure has risen almost 800,000 to 2.88 million in that period.</p>
      <p>For the North East, it means that one in four children in working households are now growing up in poverty compared to one in six in 2010.</p>
      <p>The research was carried out by Landman Economics for the TUC which says government policies, such as cuts to in-work benefits, have been a key driver behind the findings.</p>
      <p>Other factors it highlighted were weak wage growth, the spread of insecure work, population growth and the abolishment of child poverty targets.</p>
      <p>In 2016 the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/conservative-party">Conservative</a> government abolished the Child Poverty Act, which had been introduced by the previous <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/labour-party">Labour</a> government with the goal of eradicating child poverty by 2020.</p>
      <p>According to the latest figure from 2018, the overall number of children living in poverty in the North East is 209,279.</p>
      <p>TUC Regional Secretary Beth Farhat said: “No child in our region should be growing up in poverty. But many parents are struggling to feed and clothe their kids.</p>
      <p>“The Conservatives’ cuts to in-work benefits have come at a terrible human cost. As too has their failure to tackle insecure work and get wages rising across the economy.</p>
      <p>“We need a government focused on helping working families, not wealthy donors and hedge funds.”</p>

      <p>The TUC is calling on all political parties to raise the minimum wage to £10 an hour, stop and scrap Universal Credit, ban zero-hours contracts and give workers new rights to join unions and bargain for better pay and conditions across industries.</p>
      <p>Commenting on the TUC report, Jane Streather, chair of the North East Child Poverty Commission, said: “These figures highlight the deeply concerning scale of in-work poverty in our region, and confirm that having a parent or carer in work is simply no longer enough to prevent children from growing up poor.</p>
      <p>“Living in poverty can have a devastating effect on children’s physical health, their mental wellbeing, their ability to learn and of course their later life chances.</p>
      <p>“And it’s completely unacceptable that the number of children growing up poor has increased so dramatically over the last decade, in what is one of the largest economies in the world.</p>
      <p>“The next government must put tackling child poverty front and centre of its agenda. This means supporting families and properly funding the services they use, urgently addressing low pay and precarious employment, and immediately investing in a social security system that is fit for purpose and recognises the real cost of living.”</p>
      <p>The Department for Work and Pensions said it was unable to comment on the report as, it said, we are currently in the pre-general election period.</p>
      <p>However in previous stories on child poverty numbers in working families, it said children growing up in working households were five times less likely to be in relative poverty and that the government spends more than £95bn each year on working age benefits.</p>
