      <p>The American businesswoman embroiled in an investigation over her relationship with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/boris-johnson/">Boris Johnson</a> has refused to answer whether they had an affair.</p>
      <p>Jennifer Arcuri repeatedly dodged the question when she appeared on Good Morning Britain today but said ‘there was a very special relationship there’.</p>
      <p>She said the PM has left her heartbroken by refusing to take her calls after news of the relationship broke.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid, Ms Arcuri said: ‘For a long time it existed. I felt I could talk to him about anything.</p>
      <p>‘For the last 10 years I’ve dealt directly with him.</p>
      <p>‘The last time I called him he picked up and said ‘hello’ and then hung up.</p>
      <p>‘I think the respectful thing to do would be to pick up the phone.’</p>

      <p>Mr Johnson is accused of having an extra-marital affair with the tech entrepreneur during his time as London Mayor.</p>

      <p>During this period, Ms Arcuri received £11,500 in sponsorship from the Mayor’s promotional agency, London &amp; Partners, and access to trade missions to Tel Aviv and New York, after intervention from the mayor’s office.</p>
      <p>Ms Arcuri said she won the funds and access on merit.</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson has insisted there was no interest to declare and that he acted with ‘full propriety’.</p>
      <p>But the Independent Office of Police Conduct (IOPC) is currently investigating if there is enough evidence to mount a criminal investigation against Mr Johnson into allegations of misconduct in public office over the alleged favours to Ms Arcuri.</p>

      <p>The IOPC is expected to delay an announcement on its decision until after the election.</p>
      <p>It said recently: ‘Our assessment of this matter is ongoing as we continue to collect information and seek legal advice.’</p>
      <p>In an ITV Exposure programme shown last night, which alleges the pair had a four-year affair, Ms Arcuri refused to comment on her relationship with the PM but said friends had urged her to ‘admit the affair’.</p>
      <p>She accused the prime minister of refusing to speak to her and treating her like ‘some fleeting one-night stand’.</p>

      <p>This morning she said: ‘I can’t speak to what he’s doing now, I don’t understand it.</p>

      <p>‘It doesn’t make sense to me. Why is he ignoring me?</p>
      <p>‘I did move on, I got married and had a child and was trying to build my own business separate to Innotech and the events I did with him.</p>
      <p>‘I didn’t expect to be dragged back in to this.’</p>
      <p>When asked by the presenters what she wants to get out of speaking with Mr Johnson, she said: ‘I want him to acknowledge the destruction I have had to endure carrying the heat for three months as he carries out his quest for power.’</p>
      <p>She added: ‘I am the collateral damage of his quest for greatness.’</p>
