      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/CristianoRonaldo">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> insists Maurizio Sarri was right to substitute him for <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Juventus">Juventus</a> in recent weeks because he was playing through injury.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese superstar was taken off after 55 minutes against <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ACMilan">AC Milan</a> last week.</p>
      <p>And Ronaldo was seen heading straight down the tunnel and drove home before the match had ended.</p>
      <p>It followed Sarri substituting him days before in the Champions League match with Lokomotiv Moscow, but Ronaldo has clarified the situation amid speculation that there is a rift between the player and manager.</p>
      <p>“In the last three weeks I have been limited. Everyone knows that I don’t like to be substituted,” Ronaldo told A Bola.</p>

      <p>“But there was no problem in my gestures after the change. I tried to help Juventus by playing injured.</p>
      <p>“No one likes to be replaced, but I understand it, because I wasn’t well in those two games. I wasn’t 100 per cent.”</p>
