      <h1>Barcelona’s chief target rejects a lucrative contract extension</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T08:34:24+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 08:34</time> by <a rel="author">Nishant Narayanan</a></address>
      <h3>Neymar, <a href="https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/1205762/Neymar-PSG-contract-Barcelona-transfer"><b>reportedly</b></a>, is keen on rejecting Paris Saint-Germain’s new contract in order to return to FC Barcelona to play alongside Messi and Suarez.</h3>
      <p>Neymar was unable to secure his demands of moving to Barcelona in the summer, <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-7697313/PSG-forward-Neymar-pay-17million-pocket-seal-Barcelona-return.html"><b>reportedly</b></a> offering his own money to secure the deal. Even then the talisman has refused to give up on the transfer. It has been just over 2 years since his move to the French capital, where the forward is currently unsettled.</p>
      <p>The Brazilians current contract runs until 2022, and while PSG will not look to transfer the forward,<a href="https://www.sport-english.com/en/news/ligue-1/neymar-snubs-psg-attempt-to-renew-his-deal-7740187"><b> Sport</b></a> claims that Neymar will not extend his stay at the Parc des Princes, even if it means to forcefully play for the French side for another season.</p>
      <p>The attacker reportedly is also pressuring to secure a return to Catalonia, while Barca are having their own issues regarding tallying their books in order to spend big money again. The Spanish giants have already spent 107 million pounds on Antoine Greizmann in order to improve their attacking trio and therefore will find it difficult to offer PSG a huge sum of money in order to secure Neymar. They have already tried an alternative by offering the Parisians numerous player exchange deals which were all unwanted by PSG.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, Barcelona’s sporting director, Eric Abidal, stated the club’s desire to bring back the Brazilian who racked up 105 goals in 186 appearances during his Barca days.</p>
      <p>Abidal told<a href="https://www.mundodeportivo.com/futbol/fc-barcelona/20191117/471667601804/abidal-neymar-barca-fichaje-refuerzo-entrevista-md.html"><b> Mundo Deportivo</b></a> that Neymar will always be “a clear option”.</p>
      <blockquote>“A top player, who has a Barca philosophy and who is performing at a high level, will always be an option.</blockquote>
      <p>Neymar has appeared for five games this season, scoring an impressive four goals, many being the only goal of the match. For now, only time will tell where Neymar’s future lies.</p>
      <p>Do you think Neymar’s return will solve Barcelona’s scoring issues?</p>
