      <h2>North Somerset Council chiefs are set to approve a 25-year lease to use land at Portishead Lake Grounds</h2>

      <p>Council chiefs are set to approve moves to site a new skate park at Portishead Lake Grounds.</p>
      <p>North Somerset Council executive is recommending that landlord's consent is given to Portishead Wheels and Skate Park (WASP) to site a skate park on land at the rear of the boathouse.</p>
      <p>The proposal includes agreeing a 25-year lease for the land, subject to funding and planning permission being secured.</p>
      <p>The executive is due to meet in early January to rubber-stamp the decision.</p>
      <p>If approved as expected, the decision marks a major step forward in a long running campaign to site a new skate facility at the Lake Grounds.</p>

      <p>Planning permission was granted on appeal for a skate park at the Lake Grounds in 2011.</p>
      <p>However the project never moved forward because North Somerset Council refused to grant landlord's consent.</p>
      <p>A North Somerset Council spokesman confirmed the recommendation to approve the landlord's consent application.</p>
      <p>The spokesman said: “An application for landlord's consent to build a skate park at Portishead Lake Grounds will be considered by North Somerset Council's Executive at its next meeting on Tuesday 7 January.</p>
      <p>“The application from Community Interest Company Portishead WASP was due to be considered at the Executive meeting scheduled for 4 December.</p>

      <p>“However, this meeting has had to be moved to January due to the council being in pre-election period following the announcement of the General Election on December 12.</p>
      <p>“The report due to go to the December meeting recommends that a 25-year lease be granted to Portishead WASP subject to conditions regarding terms, availability of funding and planning permission.</p>
      <p>“That report will now go to the meeting on January 7.”</p>
      <p>WASP has asked the council for a piece of land of between 800 and 1,000 square metres.</p>
      <p>The site includes part of the current area of hardstanding by the boathouse and a small section of the existing park.</p>
      <p>If landlord's consent is agreed, a pre-planning application will then be submitted.</p>
      <p>A full consultation will be carried out with local residents as part of the application.</p>
      <p>A full planning application will then be submitted.</p>

      <p>The park will not only be for skateboarding but also for scooter, rollerblade and BMX users.</p>
      <p>The preferred design is for a ‘pump park’ which would see a concrete skating bowl set into the ground with a BMX track around the perimeter.</p>
      <p>The facility is expected to cost between £160,000 and £300,000 depending on the design.</p>
      <p>Funding will be sought from various grant bodies as well as the town and district council and a fundraising campaign will be launched.</p>
      <p>Over the years numerous locations for a new skate park in Portishead have been considered.</p>
      <p>A skate park already exists at Merlin Park in the town.</p>
      <p>But as the sport has become more popular in recent years, so has the desire for a bigger and better facility.</p>
