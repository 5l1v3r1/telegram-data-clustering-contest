      <p>Pan-European stock market operator Euronext said on Monday that it was in talks with Spanish bourse BME over a possible takeover offer, as consolidation heats up in the financial exchanges industry.</p>
      <p>“Euronext confirms that it is now in talks with the board of directors of BME, which may or may not lead to an offer being made. A further announcement will be made as and when appropriate,” Euronext said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The BME said that it had not taken any decision yet regarding the situation.</p>
      <p>Attempts at exchange mergers, most recently between the <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=London+Stock+Exchange">London Stock Exchange</a> and <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_company=Deutsche+Boerse">Deutsche Boerse</a>, have collapsed in the face of competition and political opposition, although Euronext managed to beat off a challenge from Nasdaq to buy the Oslo exchange recently.</p>
      <p>Madrid is among the smallest of Europe’s exchanges with a market capitalisation of €2.1 billion, less than half of Euronext’s €5 billion.</p>
      <p>Euronext acquired <a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Irish+Stock+Exchange">Irish Stock Exchange</a> last year from a group of Dublin stockbrokerages in a €158.8 million deal.</p>
