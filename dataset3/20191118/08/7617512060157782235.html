      <p>Two pedestrians in their 80s were hit by a vehicle at a Sidney intersection Sunday night.</p>
      <p>The pedestrians, ages 88 and 87, suffered non-life threatening injuries when they were struck in the crosswalk at Sidney Avenue and Third Street near the Star Cinema.</p>
      <p>One received treatment at the scene and the other was taken to hospital for assessment and was released, said Sidney-North Saanich spokeswoman Meighan de Pass.</p>
      <p>The driver received a ticket for failure to yield to pedestrians at a crosswalk and for a windshield or window that impairs vision, de Pass said.</p>
      <p>The fire department was at the scene by 10 p.m. and the intersection remained closed for a time as Sidney RCMP investigated.</p>
