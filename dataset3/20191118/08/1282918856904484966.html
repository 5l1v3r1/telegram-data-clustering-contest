      <p>India head coach Ravi Shastri was recently spotted offering prayers at the famous Mahakaleshwar Temple near Indore. The shrine is important to the Hindu community because it hosts one of the twelve Jyotirlingas. India is currently in the middle of a two-match Test series with Bangladesh and go into the second Test being 1-0 up in the series.</p>

      <h3>Prayer video does rounds on social media</h3>
      <p>The video which shows Shastri offering prayers among two priests and other devotees has been circulated widely on social media. Mostly shared on WhatsApp, the video has also been posted to Twitter by some users. Here is one such post.</p>

      <p>The Mahakaleshwar Temple is located in Ujjain and is only an hour's drive away from Indore. It can be assumed that the video was taken after India's triumph over Bangladesh in the first Test, which only lasted three days. The match saw Bangladesh losing by an innings and 130 runs as India steamrolled over the visitors. Led by Mayank Agarwal's 243 and Mohammed Shami's seven wickets, Bangladesh never really seemed to have a chance. </p>
      <h3>Historic Test ahead</h3>
      <p>Now that the Indore Test is over, India move on to making history at the Eden Gardens where they host Bangladesh for both the teams' first-ever Day-Night Test match. Sourav Ganguly, after his appointment as the BCCI President, proposed for the match to happen and the BCB obliged along with the Indian players. As reported by a news agency, Ganguly talked about how Test cricket needs rejuvenation and the practice of Day-Night matches had to begin in India at some point or another. </p>

      <p>Ganguly emphasised that talented players like Virat Kohli should not play in front of empty stands, referring to the difficulty of selling Test match tickets. Day-night Tests will allow the working audience to enjoy Test cricket after work. Team India players have been practising with the pink ball under the lights to prepare themselves for the new challenge.</p>
