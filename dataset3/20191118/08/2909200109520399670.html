      <p>Good morning friends. I have seen a screenshot of a purported published story on ghanaweb.com with headline “Akufo-Addo brings Jet Li to train NPP Militia in karate – Brogya Gyamfi”.</p>
      <p>I have not spoken about the visit of Jet Li to Ghana anywhere; not to any media house. I therefore entreat all to ignore this obvious malicious non-existing story and treat it with disdain.</p>
