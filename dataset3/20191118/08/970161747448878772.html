      <p>Kerry Katona has compared her infamous <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/this-morning/">This Morning</a> interview to that of <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-andrew-duke-of-york/">Prince Andrew</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/prince-andrew-interview-described-nuclear-explosion-level-bad-11169720/">’s ‘nuclear explosion level bad’ interview</a> on Newsnight.</p>
      <p>The Duke Of York’s sit down with Emily Maitlis caused viewers to cringe as he attempted to explain his friendship with Jeffrey Epstein and insisted he could not have had sex with the woman accusing him because he had taken daughter Beatrice to Pizza Express on that specific date.</p>
      <p>Now Kerry has compared<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2008/10/22/slurring-kerry-katonas-this-morning-shocker-59043/"> her own infamous interview in 2008</a> to that of the royal’s, celebrating she was no longer the ‘car crash of the century’.</p>

      <p>In the chatter around Prince Andrew’s interview, who would have thunk Kerry would be weighing in, eh?</p>

      <p>During her own interview, the former Atomic Kitten star slurred her words and frequently looked around the studio calling for her husband Mark Croft as she was interviewed by presenters Philip Schofield and Fern Britton.</p>
      <p>Over a decade ago Kerry was grilled on air and accused of being drunk, later blaming her worse-for-wear appearance was down to her bipolar medication.</p>
      <p>Taking to social media, Kerry shared a side by side shot of her interview with Prince Andrew’s as she wrote: ‘Turns out my interview is no longer car crash of the Century no more #princeandrew cheers for that!!!’</p>

      <p>Riffing on his claim he was at the Pizza Express – remembering the location and day perfectly in the interview – Kerry added she believed she saw the royal in Woking Iceland.</p>
      <p>Yesterday reaction to the ‘no holds barred’ interview flooded social media.</p>
      <p>TV presenter Giles Coren said he was not convinced by the pizza story, tweeting: ‘Ask him what he ordered. If he says “a sloppy Giuseppe” you’ve got him. Because they didn’t introduce that till 2006.’</p>
      <p>Later in the interview Prince Andrew was told how [accuser] Mrs Guiffre had been ‘very specific’ about him that night, claiming he was ‘profusely sweating’ and that she went on to have a bath.</p>
      <p>The duke told Ms Maitlis there was a ‘slight problem’ with that story – claiming he was unable to perspire at the time.</p>

      <p>Of the interview overall, Royal Central website editor Charlie Proctor said: ‘I expected a train wreck.</p>
      <p>‘That was a plane crashing into an oil tanker, causing a tsunami, triggering a nuclear explosion level bad.’</p>
      <p>Comedian Dom Joly also described it as ‘a worse car crash than getting a lift home from Prince Philip’.</p>
      <p>And now Kerry Katona is a royal correspondent – stranger things have happened.</p>
