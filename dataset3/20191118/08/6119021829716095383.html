      <p>Police on Monday stopped hundreds of JNU students from continuing with their protest march to Parliament by putting up barricades. With posters in hand and chanting anti-fee hike slogans, hundreds of students marched on the streets of Delhi in defiance of Section 144 that was slapped in the morning to prevent the protests. Section 144 prevents the gathering of more than four persons in one place.</p>

      <p>Police erected barricades a kilometre away from Parliament to prevent the students from proceeding, leading to students trying to climb over the barricades. "The protest by JNU students has been stopped by Delhi Police about a kilometre away from Parliament's north gate," former JNUSU president N. Sai Balaji said.</p>
      <p>"The students are struggling hard to clear the barricades installed by the Delhi Police, but they admit that they might not reach Parliament because of heavy police and CRPF deployment in the way," a student said. The protest march is against the hostel fee hike.</p>
      <p>The protest was held even as the Education Secretary addressed their concern by a partial rollback and on Monday announced a new committee to open a dialogue with the students. JNU has been rocked by protests and alleged vandalism by students, with graffiti painted on the Vice Chancellor's office and the Dean held hostage.</p>
