        <b>Anu Malik is back to judging Indian Idol Season 11 along with Neha Kakkar and Vishal Dadlani. This has irked many as he is a #MeToo accused. Tanushree Dutta has shared her thoughts on the same</b>
      </p>
      <p>Anu Malik has been embroiled in a #MeToo controversy since last year. He was accused by singers like Sona Mohapatra, Shweta Pandit and a few others. Just recently he had taken to Twitter to rubbish all the allegations and to say that accusations against him are fake. However, Tanushree Dutta still does not believe him. In a recent interview, she has blasted the channel for appointing him as a judge and even picked on Neha Kakkar for agreeing to work with him.</p>
      <p>To Mid-day, Tanushree Dutta quoted, "What shocks me most is how Sony, which is supposed to be a family-friendly channel, has allowed such a person to remain as a judge when several talented and high-profile women have come forward with their stories of harassment against him. Are TRPs more important than human values? Shouldn’t people who misbehave be held accountable for their deeds." Sona Mohapatra has been continuously picking on the channel for having Anu Malik as the judge despite all the allegations against him.</p>

      <p>Tanushree Dutta then commented on Neha Kakkar and the episode where a contestant forcefully kissed her on the cheeks. It was one big controversy as the contestant who claimed to be a big fan of Neha Kakkar kissed her without her consent. To this Tanushree said, "She might have got a taste of what it feels like to be harassed when a contestant forcibly kissed her on the show. But again, like her decision to work with Anu Malik, Neha decided not to press charges on the disgusting guy! It was cringeworthy to watch a female celebrity being mauled like that on TV."</p>
