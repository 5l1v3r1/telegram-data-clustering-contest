      <p>Japan's SoftBank Corp plans to merge internet unit Yahoo Japan with messaging app operator Line Corp to create a US$30 billion tech giant, as it bags struggling internet companies to bulk up against rivals like Rakuten Inc .</p>
      <p>TOKYO: Japan's SoftBank Corp plans to merge internet unit Yahoo Japan with messaging app operator Line Corp to create a US$30 billion tech giant, as it bags struggling internet companies to bulk up against rivals like Rakuten Inc .</p>
      <p>The telco in a statement said Yahoo Japan, which last month changed its name to Z Holdings Corp , will merge with Line, owned by South Korea's Naver Corp , in a deal to be completed in October 2020.</p>

      <p>The companies aim for a definitive agreement by next month in a transaction that will see SoftBank Corp and Naver form a 50:50 venture that will control Z Holdings, which will in turn operate Yahoo Japan and Line.</p>
      <p>SoftBank Corp and Naver, which owns 73per cent of money-losing Line, plan to launch a tender offer for Line's remaining shares at 5,200 yen each - a 13.4per cent premium to the shares' price before news of the merger broke. Line's shares were up 2.6per cent at 5,180 yen in early Tokyo trade on Monday.</p>
      <p>Line has been looking for growth through expansion into areas such as QR code payments with Line Pay, but has been squeezed because of its limited funds and heavy-spending peers including SoftBank, which has a rival service called PayPay.</p>
      <p>The merger deal is the latest example of consolidation in Japan's technology industry. SoftBank this month completed its acquisition of online fashion retailer Zozo Inc , whose founder and ex-Chief Executive Yusaku Maezawa sold down his stake following a series of missteps.</p>
      <p>Coming at a time of heightened political tension between Japan and South Korea, the merger might be the two countries' most significant economic cooperation of the last decade, Jaewoong Lee, a South Korean serial entrepreneur and founder of Naver rival Daum wrote on his Facebook page late on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Z Holdings will continue to be a consolidated subsidiary of SoftBank Corp, which is a unit of investment conglomerate SoftBank Group Corp . Z Holdings and Line will hold a news conference at 0800 GMT.</p>
