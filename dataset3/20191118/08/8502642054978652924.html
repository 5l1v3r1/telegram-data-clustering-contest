      <p>PARIS, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Louis Dreyfus Company (LDC) on Monday appointed its head of coffee Michael Gelchie as its new chief operating officer in the latest management reshuffle at the family-held agricultural commodity group.</p>
      <p>Gelchie will take on the COO role with immediate effect, replacing Andrea Maserati, who is leaving the firm, LDC said in a statement.</p>
      <p>LDC is one of the so-called "ABCD" quartet of global grain trading giants, alongside Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge and Cargill.</p>
      <p>Like its peers, LDC has reorganised its operations in recent years in response to falling margins in trading staple crops like cereals and oilseeds.</p>
      <p>It has also been through an acrimonious exit of minority family shareholders in which Margarita Louis-Dreyfus took near total control of the group's holding structure.</p>
      <p>After reporting improved results in 2018, LDC posted weaker earnings for the first half of 2019 and warned international trade tensions and a swine fever epidemic would continue to weigh on its activities for the rest of the year.</p>
      <p>Gelchie returned to LDC in July as coffee head, having previously worked for the group for 20 years from 1990. He will retain responsibility for coffee, according to LDC's website.</p>
      <p>Gelchie will report to Chief Executive Ian McIntosh, a company veteran who was appointed to the role just over a year ago.</p>
      <p>LDC also appointed Nigel Mamalis, another longstanding executive at the group, as global head of risk and compliance.</p>
      <p>At board level, LDC said it had named Michel Demare as deputy chairman.</p>
      <p>Demare, who was in the past chairman of crop seed and chemical group Syngenta, has been on LDC's board since April 2014.</p>
      <p>Margarita Louis-Dreyfus heads the six-person board.</p>
