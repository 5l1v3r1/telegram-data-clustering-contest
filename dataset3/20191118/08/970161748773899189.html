      <p>*Warning: This article contains huge spoilers from the latest episode from The Walking Dead season 10, titled Open Your Eyes.</p>
      <p>The Walking Dead killed off a huge hero last night as <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/the-walking-dead-season-10-episode-7-questions-we-have-after-shock-death-and-unbelievable-whisperers-twist-11164672/">Siddiq was murdered by his own partner, Dante.</a></p>
      <p>Siddiq first arrived in The Walking Dead back in season eight and swiftly became an immediate fan favourite. However, since season nine, he’s been plagued with PTSD after watching his friends get beheaded by The Whisperers, and fans grew paranoid that, in fact, t<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/24/walking-dead-season-10-fan-theory-reckons-siddiq-beheaded-victims-alphas-massacre-10978047/">he doctor was working as a mole for the masked killers.</a></p>
      <p>Last night they had their answer: Dante was playing us all along and was the Whisperer who forced Siddiq to watch his pals die in the most horrific of circumstances.</p>

      <p>Actor Avi Nash has now spilled all on his farewell, which was kept an impressively well-kept secret.</p>
      <p>Advertisement Advertisement</p>
      <p>‘Angela [Kang] and I were having our standard preseason phone call in April when she let me know the news,’ he told <a href="https://ew.com/tv/2019/11/17/walking-dead-siddiq-avi-nash-open-your-eyes/">Entertainment Weekly</a>. ‘But she’s such a masterful storyteller that rather than be sad or regretful over Siddiq’s death, I was thrilled and excited to be tasked with such a powerful arc.</p>
      <p>‘We ended up being on the phone for hours as we delved into his PTSD, his fragility, new fatherhood — the writers gifted me with a journey that had all the complexities I could dream of.’</p>
      <p>And he only has one, regret…</p>
      <p>‘I wish he’d spent more time at a BJJ gym so he’d know that you NEVER give up your back!’ Avi joked.</p>
      <p>‘Look, ultimately, the job of the actor is to serve the story, and in the case of Siddiq, I couldn’t have been luckier. His message of mercy helped resolve season 8, his commitment to family and the Grimes legacy brought the communities back together in season 9, and now, his untimely death — in Alexandria at the hands of a spy — might just be the lynchpin that sets off our heroes in season 10.</p>
      <p>‘To have that kind of impact within the narrative of a show this large and historied has been really rewarding.’</p>
