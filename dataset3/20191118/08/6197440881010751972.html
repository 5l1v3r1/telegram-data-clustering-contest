      <h1>Google Store Black Friday: $599 Pixel 4, $299 Pixel 3a, Stadia + Nest Wifi bundle</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T08:36:41+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 08:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://9to5google.com/author/technacity/" target="_blank">Abner Li</a></address>
      <p>The Google Store today is providing a “<a href="https://store.google.com/?hl=en-US">sneak peek</a>” at its upcoming Black Friday 2019 deals. Kicking off Thursday, November 28th, highlights include $200 off the Pixel 4 and a bundle that packs Stadia Premiere Edition with Nest Wifi.</p>
      <p>As <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/08/pixel-4-black-friday/">revealed</a> earlier this month, the Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL will be discounted by $200. This starts on November 24th and runs until Cyber Monday on December 2nd. The 64 GB Pixel 4 is $599 and the 128 GB model is $699, while the Pixel 4 XL starts at $699 and goes to $799. Meanwhile, the Pixel 3a and Pixel 3a XL see a $100 discount to start at $299 and $379.</p>
      <p>The most interesting deal is a bundle that includes <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/10/22/stadia-founders-edition/">Stadia Premiere Edition</a> and Nest Wifi, specifically the three-pack that features a router and two points. This $349 connectivity solution, along with the $129 Stadia Controller and Chromecast Ultra, will be $398 instead of $478.</p>
      <p>Google and Nest Wifi has a special option to <a href="https://9to5google.com/2019/11/03/google-nest-wifi-stadia/">prioritize Stadia connectivity</a>, and that synergy is clearly on display. Other notable Google Store Black Friday 2019 deals include:</p>
