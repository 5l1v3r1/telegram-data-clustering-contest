      <p>DENVER — The man accused of verbally threatening members of a Denver mosque and brandishing what looked look like a real rifle on Thursday was <a href="https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/crime/denver-mosque-threat-suspect-believed-armed-with-airsoft-rifle-bonds-out-of-jail">released from the Denver Jail</a> just after 1 a.m. local time Sunday.</p>
      <p>A female relative of Benjamin Casillas-Rocha, 24, posted a $1,000 cash bond, according to a jail official and court records. His bond was set at $10,000, but posting a cash amount allowed his release on $1,000, according to jail officials.</p>
      <p>Casillas-Rocha reportedly <a href="https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/crime/armed-man-inside-denver-mosque-arrested-police-increasing-patrols">pointed what appeared to be a long gun at four people outside the Masjid Al-Shuhadaa mosque</a> on Thursday afternoon, according to a probable cause statement. The realistic-looking gun turned out to be an airsoft pellet gun.</p>
      <p>The suspect had been at the mosque earlier in the day and was upset about losing his phone, which he believed was inside the building, police documents state.</p>
      <p>An investigation revealed he returned to the mosque later in the day, under the influence of an unknown narcotic, and started yelling anti-Muslim remarks while pointing the rifle at the four victims. He left the vicinity after hearing police had been called to the area.</p>
      <p>No one was injured.</p>
      <p>Police later found Casillas-Rocha at his home. They arrested him on an investigation of felony menacing.</p>
      <p>During a Saturday court hearing, a judge issued a protection order prohibiting the suspect from contacting alleged victims. The judge also ordered that upon release from jail, Casillas-Rocha will have intensive probation supervision, including having to wear a GPS tracking device. He’s also prohibited from possessing or attempting to possess a gun as a condition of his bond.</p>
      <p>Police are investigating the incident as a bias-motivated crime. However, the district attorney has not formally charged him.</p>
