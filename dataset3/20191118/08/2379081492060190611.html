      <h1>Euro zone bond yields steady, trade war caution supports market</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T08:12:46+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 08:12</time> by <a rel="author">Dhara Ranasinghe</a></address>
      <p>LONDON — Government bond yields in the euro area were little changed on Monday, supported by caution over U.S.-China trade talks.</p>
      <p>President Donald Trump had not yet agreed to remove any tariffs as part of a trade deal, and the size of China’s commitment to purchase U.S. farm products was not yet clear, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Friday.</p>
      <p>In early trade, most 10-year bond yields in the euro zone were largely flat on the day, as markets awaited new bonds from Belgium and Slovakia and digested news of a cut in a key Chinese interest rate.</p>
      <p>At -0.32%, Germany’s benchmark 10-year Bund yield was not far off more than one-week lows reached last week at -0.30%. It fell almost 7 bps last week in its biggest weekly decline since September.</p>
      <p>“The market clearly took back some positivity last week. This seems to be driven in part by rising skepticism on the timing of a phase-one (trade) deal,” said Henry Occleston, a rates strategist at Mizuho. “We see relative strength in the Bund persisting, particularly against Spanish and Italian bonds.”</p>
      <p>In a note, analysts at UniCredit said that if a phase-one trade deal occurs, 10-year U.S. Treasury and German bond yields could rise another 10 to 20 bps before questions are raised about the next phase of talks.</p>
      <p>But if the current discussions fail and tariffs are increased, U.S. Treasury yields — currently around 1.84% — could fall to around 1.5% and Bund yields could drop closer to -0.6%, they said.</p>
      <p>While higher-rated bond markets such as German, French and Dutch ones rallied last week, pushing borrowing costs lower, southern European debt markets have come under selling pressure.</p>
      <p>Analysts attribute the rise in yields in Italy and Spain in the past week to renewed political uncertainty, a desire by investors to lock in profits before books are closed for the year, and a growing sense that the bar to further European Central Bank stimulus is high.</p>
      <p>Ten-year bond yields in the periphery were little changed in early Monday trade, with the gap between 10-year Italian and German bond yields at 165 basis points — down from last week’s two-and-a-half-month highs above 170 bps.</p>
      <p>There was some relief for Italy after ratings agency DBRS on Friday affirmed the country’s credit rating at BBB (high) with a stable outlook. (Reporting by Dhara Ranasinghe, editing by Larry King)</p>
