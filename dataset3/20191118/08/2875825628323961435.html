      <h2>Tyson Fury has just finished a stint in WWE - and heavyweight rival Deontay Wilder says he is open to following in his footsteps by stepping in the ring in the future</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T08:40:26+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 08:40</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Deontay Wilder says he is open to the prospect of a WWE stint to follow in the footsteps of <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/tyson-fury">Tyson Fury</a> .</p>
      <p>Wilder is currently focused on his rematch with Luis Ortiz to defend his WBC world heavyweight title before a blockbuster rematch with Fury slated for February 2020.</p>
      <p>Despite his rivalry with the Gypsy King, he previously admitted his wrestling debut at WWE Crown Jewel against Braun Strowman "made sense" from a marketing perspective.</p>
      <p>And he admits he would be interested in following suit in switching his boxing gloves for wrestling boots in the future in a bid to boost his profile.</p>

      <p>Wilder told <a href="https://youtu.be/RHbWpqcC0us">PBC</a> : “We thought about that years ago for marketing purposes, promotion and stuff like that.</p>
      <p>“I’m a man that believes don’t burn no bridges.</p>
      <p>“If that opportunity comes about I could see myself jumping off a ladder, doing a flying elbow or something like that.</p>
      <p>“I’ve got the character to be able to perform in that environment, it’d be something fun, I wouldn’t turn it down.”</p>

      <p>Despite Fury's WWE cameo, Wilder insists he is still the bigger draw ahead of their rematch.</p>
      <p>Last week, Wilder said: “He’s doing it for promotion.</p>
      <p>“He’s trying to get his name bigger in America and that’s a good route to take because WWE has millions upon millions of followers.</p>
      <p>“So that was a good approach for him, trying to build his name especially after coming from his Vegas shows and their ticket sales.</p>

      <p>“The only reason he sold the first time was because he was coming to have a fight with me.</p>
      <p>“So now he’s trying to find some type of way to market himself even more before the rematch or the fight.</p>
      <p>“We’re going to tell the difference when I fight in Vegas. You’re going to see the difference of what I do and what he did.</p>
      <p>“We will know for sure who sold the pay-per-view and I guarantee you right now it’s going to be me.”</p>
