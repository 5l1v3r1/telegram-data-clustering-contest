      <h1>Won't play if Davis Cup tie against India not shifted back to Pakistan: Aisamul Haq</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T08:58:27+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 08:58</time> by <a rel="author">https://tribune.com.pk/author/4730/abdul-majid-awan/, Tribune.com.pk</a></address>
      <p>Tennis star Aisamul Haq has written a letter to the president of the Pakistan Tennis Federation (PTF), Saleem Saifullah, saying that he will opt out of the Davis Cup tie against India if the match is played on a neutral venue.</p>
      <p>According to the details, Aisam has written that it is sad that the International Tennis Federation shifted the match out of Pakistan by citing security as the reason.</p>
      <p>He reasoned that “thousands of Indians are roaming around in Pakistan at the Kartarpur Corridor and also in the country. No Indian has any reservations on security”.</p>
      <p>He further added: “Sri Lanka cricket team came and played in Lahore. Teams from Bangladesh have played in different cities. British royal couple visited Islamabad and Lahore. The Prime Minister of Holland is coming to Pakistan. After looking at all this, shifting the venue of the Pakistan-India match to a neutral venue is unfair.”</p>
      <p>He protested that he will not play the tie if the decision to shift it to a neutral venue is not taken back.</p>
      <p>“I have always played to earn respect for Pakistan. This is the reason I am raising my voice against the decision.”</p>
      <p>It should be mentioned here that the Davis Cup tie between Pakistan and India was supposed to take place on November 29 in Islamabad, but the Indian Tennis Federation had reservations and so the venue was changed.</p>
