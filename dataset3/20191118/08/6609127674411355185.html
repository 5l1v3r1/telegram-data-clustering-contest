      <p>Bev, 62, told OK! Magazine her final scenes would air next year, in news set to devastate her loyal fans.</p>
      <p>Revealing her reaction after telling bosses of the Weatherfield soap of her intention to quit, she added: “I was in shock, I felt totally numb."</p>
      <p>She added: “I’ve been told Liz is going to go with one hell of a bang. I cant wait!”</p>
      <p>The Leeds-born actress did tell how she had experienced many "sleepless nights" deliberating with the major decision.</p>

      <p>Yet Corrie fans can take some comfort from the fact Liz will remain on screen until summer 2020.</p>
      <p>Bev, who joined Corrie in 1989, will leave screens in order to go on tour with comedy play, The Thunder Girls.</p>
      <p>She plays character Roxanne in the show, which stars four women over the age of 50.</p>
      <p>Viewers will miss Liz's bubbly nature and passionate streak on screen, particularly as Steve McDonald's mum has been at the heart of recent storylines.</p>
