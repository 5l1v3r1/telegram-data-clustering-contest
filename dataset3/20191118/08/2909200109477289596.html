Bishop J Y Adu supports  his stance with Proverbs 3:9-10 cautioning all those who have been using money as tithe to desist or incur the wrath of God “Give honour to the Lord with your wealth, and with the first-fruits of all your increase: So your store-houses will be full of grain, and your vessels overflowing with new wine”.

      <p>Bishop J Y Adu speaking on Kumasi based Angel Fm Church Bells show host Ike De Unpredictable on Sunday November 10, 2019 monitored by <a href="http://MyNewsGh.com/">MyNewsGh.com</a> stated categorically that there is no blessing in paying tithe with money saying God does not recognize and accept money as tithe.</p>
      <p>Bishop J Y Adu supports  his stance with Proverbs 3:9-10 cautioning all those who have been using money as tithe to desist or incur the wrath of God</p>
      <p>“Give honour to the Lord with your wealth, and with the first-fruits of all your increase: So your store-houses will be full of grain, and your vessels overflowing with new wine”.</p>
      <p>According to Bishop J Y Adu “God ordered Lewis to pay tithe to him. God told them to pay tithe after their harvest not money”.</p>
      <p>“Though God told Lewis to pay tithe but Christians are not part of that covenant. Tithe covenant was between Lewis and God” He explained.</p>
      <p>Recently, a popular pastor waded into the ongoing debate of whether it’s compulsory for Christians to be paying their tithes or not.<br/><br/>The preacher identified as Sam Adeyemi, a senior pastor of Day Star Christian Centre revealed that has never come across anything that suggests that God would be angry with people who fail to pay tithe and curse them.<br/><br/>“I have been following the tithe debate. I discovered that it has been an age-long debate and it will be on for a long time. My first observation is that church people are behaving as if we own the word tithe.</p>
      <p>“We don’t own the word. It is an English word. I want to say clearly that tithe, as practiced under the law of Moses, has expired. The death and resurrection of Jesus have put paid to it. It has expired.</p>
