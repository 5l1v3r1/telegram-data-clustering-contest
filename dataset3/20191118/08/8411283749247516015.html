      <p>The handset supply chain is expected to bid farewell to 2019 with much improvements from those disappointing results seen during the end of 2018 when the handset market was hit by a demand chill. Taiwan-based PCB makers have seen order visibility extend to early 2020, and they are now ready to <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20191118PD205.html">keep production running</a> during the Lunar New Year holidays in late January. In the semiconductor sector, the supply chain has seen strong potentials from SiC MOSFETs. In a recent interview by igitimes, Hestia Power CEO Lee Chwan-ying talked about the development of <a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20191111PD212.html">SiC MOSFETs</a>.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20191118PD205.html">PCB production lines may remain humming during Lunar New Year</a>: Taiwan-based PCB makers are planning to maintain normal production during the Lunar New Year holidays in late January thanks to clear visibility of orders from Apple and Chinese handset vendors extending to early 2020, according to industry sources.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20191111PD212.html">SiC MOSFET development: Q&amp;A interview with Hestia Power CEO Lee Chwan-ying</a>: SiC MOSFETs sees fast development and growing demand due to needs for high-voltage and high-power operating environment, but it is quite impossible for them to completely replace Si IGBTs (insulated gate bipolar transistors), according to Lee Chwan-ying, CEO of Hestia Power.</p>
