      <h1>Street Fighter 5: Champion Edition includes all characters, stages and costumes for $30</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T08:46:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 08:46</time> by <a rel="author">Sherif Saed</a></address>
      <p>There’s a new Street Fighter 5 edition in the works, coming next year.</p>
      <p>Capcom has announced <b>Street Fighter 5: Champion Edition</b>, the second edition to follow from the main game’s release. Unlike Arcade Edition, Champion is more than just re-branding of existing content.</p>
      <p>Street Fighter 5: Champion Edition is the game’s most complete yet, and comes with all announced and released post-launch fighters, stages and costumes for the main game as well as Arcade Edition. It does not, however, include certain content, such as Fighting Chance costumes, Capcom Pro Tour DLC and other brand collaborations.</p>
      <p>That’s 40 characters, 34 stages and over 200 costumes, by Capcom’s count. Champion Edition also includes Gill, who the publisher announced today will be available to existing players sometime in December.</p>
      <p>Street Fighter 5: Champion Edition arrives February 14 on PC and PS4 (physical and digital), priced $30/£25. Existing players can also upgrade to the Champion Edition and unlock all content today for $25/£20.</p>
