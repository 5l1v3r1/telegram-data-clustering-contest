      <h1>‘Flirty Dancing’ Is A Blind Dating Show W/ Choreographed Routines &amp; Fuck, It’s Mesmerising</h1>

      <p>Want your cold, usually-dormant heart to feel something again? Keen to remind yourself that you’re capable of feeling anything other than horniness and weekly existential crises? Well, please, look no further than <i>Flirty Dancing</i>, one of the most joyous UK dating shows that happens to exist on this planet Earth.</p>
      <p><i>Flirty Dancing</i> is a blind dating show in which romantic hopefuls separately learn choreography to a dance, only to meet for the first time when they perform the routine together.</p>
      <p>The program, which is heading into its second season, has received some much-deserved attention over the past day or so after going absolutely viral on Twitter… primarily thanks to this routine below. Garry and Ryan, take it away, you beautiful, beautiful souls.</p>

      <p>The joy in their faces. Their piercing eye contact with one another. Their sheer elation as they conclude the piece. I’m actually crying.</p>
      <p>This clip achieved <i>so</i> much viral success that host (and absolute snacc of a human) <b>Ashley Banjo</b> shared his gratitude. “When I watch Gary and Ryan dance it absolutely reaffirms to me that love is love!”</p>

      <p>Although we aren’t sure if Garry and Ryan remain an item today, some trusty internet sleuths downloaded the episode and found that they’d gone on a few dates after their sacred dance.</p>
