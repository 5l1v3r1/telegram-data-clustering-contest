      <p>Robot versions of Japan's Olympic and Paralympic mascots thrilled hundreds of school children in Tokyo on Monday, striking sporting poses and displaying hearts in their electronic eyes.</p>
      <p>The event at a local elementary <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/school/">school</a> was billed as a chance to showcase some of the technology Japan hopes will wow visitors at the Tokyo 2020 Games.</p>
      <p>Some 600 pupils clapped and shouted "kawaii (cute)!" as the toddler-sized versions of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic mascots were unveiled.</p>
      <p>The futuristic-looking pair, Miraitowa and Someity, can show "feelings" in their gleaming eyes by displaying hearts or stars.</p>
      <p>School principal Jun Ninomiya told <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/children/">children</a> the "robots will play active roles behind the scenes" at the summer games.</p>
      <p>"Have fun and find out what functions they have and what they can do," he told the children at Hoyonomori Elementary School in Tokyo.</p>
      <p>Blue-and-white Miraitowa is the mascot for the Olympics and pink-and-white Someity is for the Paralympics.</p>
      <p>With huge eyes and pointy ears, the <a href="https://techxplore.com/tags/mascot/">mascot</a> robots have multiple joints and arms which can be remotely controlled.</p>
      <p>The robots, paired with regular, full-sized mascots, demonstrated different poses representing various Olympic sports for the children to guess.</p>
      <p>The pint-sized pair can't talk but cameras inside their heads enable them to recognise expressions on the face of the person standing in front of them and respond.</p>
      <p>They can also mirror each other's moves, meaning one at a public viewing place could pass moves onto the other one at an actual Olympics venue, helping spectators feel like they were cheering at the venue, organisers say.</p>
      <p>The robots, developed in collaboration with auto giant Toyota, are part of a push by Japan to put its tech sector back on the map after years in which the country's reputation as an industry leader has flagged.</p>
