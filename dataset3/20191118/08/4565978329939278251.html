        <b>More fuel availability in the territory has allowed re-establishing the transport to some rural destinations, which in recent months did not have the service.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Las Tunas, Cuba.- The towns of Mejías, Río Blanco, Mastrapa, Villa Nueva, Estrada, Gastón and Dormitorio reconnect with the main municipality through two trips (opening and return) and only on alternate days.</p>
      <p>Eulider González, head of the Complex of the State Passenger Base Unit of the Provincial Transport Company, assures 26Digital that the different routes that were interrupted have gradually been reinstated and - at this moment - the service tends to stability, to the satisfaction of a large number of people who travel every day to the different areas of Las Tunas geography.</p>
      <p>"We had to face the great challenge of placing resources in the most demanded destinations," says Eulider, but we already guarantee the coverage of the entire territory.</p>
      <p>"For the next month we guarantee the daily departure of inter-municipal buses; and the rural service will also be maintained on alternate days, with opening and closure trips."</p>
      <p>"Our company received 12 new buses that will be distributed between urban and inter-municipal routes. As more fuel is available, more trips will be added to the different destinations.</p>
      <p>"In spite of the limitations with the availability of hydrocarbons, today we can guarantee the stability of the services. In the urban destinations, all the routes of buses are active; only the routes 2, 10, 250, and Kilómetro 7 remain working on alternate days. As long as the resources allow it; the departures and amount of trips will return to normal."</p>
