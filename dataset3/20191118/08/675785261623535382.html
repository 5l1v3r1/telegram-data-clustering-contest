      <h2>In this week's EFL on Quest column - pundit Ian Holloway has his say on Neil Warnock's surprising departure from Cardiff and his replacement Neil Harris</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T08:33:46+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 08:33</time> by <a rel="author">Ian Holloway, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/ian-holloway/</a></address>
      <p>Neil Warnock has left Cardiff - and it's a difficult situation to assess.</p>
      <p>I was there at the weekend, I watched their game. There was nothing wrong with his team. They hit the bar twice and unfortunately Bristol City's shot went in from 30 yards. That's the close margins of the Championship.</p>
      <p>Only their owners will know what they're thinking and where they're going. I would have thought Neil Warnock was the right man to get them back up.</p>
      <p>For me, there aren't any better managers for getting teams promoted than Neil. Maybe there is more to it - I really don't know.</p>
      <p>From afar it doesn't look like they're struggling. There is a long part of the season left and from the performance that I saw - I don't think there's a great deal wrong.</p>
      <p>Neil has had an incredible career. What he achieved at Rotherham was absolutely sensational. Then he's gone straight from there to Cardiff - they were in the bottom three - and he got them promoted.</p>

      <p>He had a great chance to keep them up but for the terrible tragedy involving Emiliano Sala. Everyone knew they needed a centre-forward and it was horrendous.</p>
      <p>I'd like to think Neil has got more left in him - but that must have knocked a lot out of him. He's a very personable guy who gets very close to his players.</p>
      <p>But I hope Cardiff is not his last job.</p>
      <p>Neil Harris has replaced him and he is one of a number of young managers out there who deserve another chance.</p>
      <p>Cardiff is a fantastic club with a massive support and Neil Harris is a very lucky man in my opinion. Good luck to him.</p>

      <h3>Barnsley need to make a decision - and quick</h3>
      <p>The situation at Barnsley is very strange. It looked as though all was rosy after a great promotion last season. I don't think anyone outside of the club thought they would go up.</p>
      <p>They had a terrific run, seemed to get better and better but lost players in the summer, which makes it tough.</p>
      <p>Barnsley have to make a decision very quickly. I don't think a caretaker manager who hasn't won in five games is the way to go - they need some experience in there.</p>
      <p>They need a manager who is used to managing to get that team going. They are falling adrift and that is the last thing they want.</p>
      <p>But there are a lot of games coming up and things can change very quickly. But they need to make their mind up.</p>
