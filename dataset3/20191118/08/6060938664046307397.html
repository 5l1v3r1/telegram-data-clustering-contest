      </p>
      <p>According to the latest report on BoxofficeIndia.com, the masala entertainer managed to grow as it collected Rs 9.75 crore on its third day after collecting Rs 7 crore on its first and second day respectively. Meanwhile, <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Nawazuddin-Siddiqui">Nawazuddin Siddiqui</a> and <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Athiya-Shetty">Athiya Shetty</a>'s 'Motichoor Chaknachoor' which also released along with '<a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Marjaavaan">Marjaavaan</a>', saw a rise in its collection from the first day as it collected Rs 60 lacs in the domestic circuit.</p>
      <p>'Marjaavaan' saw Sidharth's best first-weekend collection after 'Kapoor &amp; Sons' which had collected nearly Rs 25 crore. Furthermore, the report also suggested that the real test for the film will be on Monday if it'll be able to allure the audience to the theatres and if the film can show a drop of under 50% it should be able to do reasonably well at the box office.</p>
      <p>Not only Sidharth but the audience have been hailing Riteish's stunning performance as well. Even the songs from the film have been topping several music charts and celebs have also hailed the film and as a result of good word of mouth, the film has managed to see a rise in its collection on Sunday.</p>
