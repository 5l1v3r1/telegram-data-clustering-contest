      <h1>Mum warns parents after being sold out of date Aptamil baby milk by Sainsbury's</h1>
      <h2>Tina Butler concerned about health risk and is urging mums and dads to be aware</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T08:36:08+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 08:36</time> by <a rel="author">Neil Shaw, Jamie Hawkins, Geoffrey Bennett</a></address>
      <p>Sainsbury's has apologized after a mum bought baby milk which was a month out of date.</p>
      <p>Tina Butler returned two bottles of Aptamil for her son Jayden and confronted staff about the slip, reports <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/uk-news/mums-anger-baby-milk-bought-17254084">Wales Online</a>.</p>
      <p>The 28-year-old from Whitstable, who bought the milk in Chestfield, Kent, said: “I went back to the supermarket with my dad to make them aware of the situation.</p>
      <p>“I told three women behind the customer service desk about it and they didn’t seem interested.</p>
      <p>“When I showed one of the ladies the bottle, she was reluctant to give it back.”</p>
      <p>The staff offered Miss Butler a refund on both of the bottles - which retail at £3.70 each - and a £10 gift card for her troubles, which she turned down.</p>
      <p>Unhappy with the offer she then phoned Sainsbury’s customer service to demand action to avoid a repeat of the episode.</p>
      <p>This time she was offered a £25 gift card, and then £50, but she refused both.</p>
      <p>She said: “It is neglect. You trust what you buy to be in date and to get home and realize that it’s a month out of date; it shatters your trust.</p>
      <p>“I just want parents to be aware Sainsbury’s are not checking their dates.</p>
      <p>“I am worried. I have read stories about babies being taken to hospital after eating out of date food."</p>
      <p>A Sainsbury’s spokesperson said: “We have apologized to Tina for her experience and offered her a gesture of goodwill.</p>
      <p>"Stock has been checked to make sure this does not happen again.”</p>
