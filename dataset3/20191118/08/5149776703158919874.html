      <h1>Father-of-two determined to work after brain tumour left him struggling to see</h1>
      <h2>"If I close my right eye the left eye is just light and shade."</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T08:41:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 08:41</time> by <a rel="author">Jamie Barlow</a></address>
      <p>Father-of-two Martin Hales has said he is determined to carry on working after being diagnosed with a serious brain tumour.</p>
      <p>Mr Hales, 59, of Vernon Drive, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/profits-tumble-notts-countys-former-3546163">Nuthall</a>, said 'there’s no point sitting around feeling sorry for yourself'.</p>
      <p>Mr Hales had worked as a furniture maker but has now been left unable to drive.</p>
      <p>Keen to continue working, he is now employed by a charity called Headway, a brain injury association.</p>
      <p>After noticing problems with his sight and "feeling really low", medics told him the devastating news he had a benign tumour in 2011.</p>
      <p>"It was a big shock," he said. "You just did not expect them to come out and say it's a brain tumour.</p>
      <p>"As soon as you hear the news 'brain tumour' you think the world's ending. It was operable.</p>
      <p>"They explained to me with it being benign it does not spread but it could still grow."</p>
      <p>He described the tumour as "like a boiled egg behind my left eye and under the brain".</p>
      <p>Parts of the tumour, which was about an inch-and-a-half in diametre, have been removed.</p>
      <p>Mr Hales also underwent radiotherapy at Nottingham City Hospital. But his vision has been affected and he suffers from fatigue.</p>
      <p>"If I close my right eye the left eye is just light and shade," he said.</p>
      <p>"I can't make anything out. There's no actual picture."</p>
      <p>“During my time in recovery, I found that there wasn’t really much help about, other than what charities were able to offer,” he said.</p>
      <p>“If it weren’t for charities like Headway, people would really struggle. I know I would have.”</p>
      <p>He became involved with Headway after enrolling on a return to work scheme.</p>

      <p>Mr Hales now works at the charity's shop in Nottingham Road, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/">Eastwood</a>.</p>
      <p>"I find it so worthwhile to work for a charity. I’m around people who understand what I’ve been through and some of the challenges I might face.</p>
      <p>“I love coming to work. It helps me to take my mind off things and focus on the positive," he said.</p>
      <p>"Life after a brain injury can be tough sometimes but there’s no point sitting around feeling sorry for yourself, you’ve got to get out there and do something you love.</p>
      <p>“The damage caused to my left eye as a result of the tumour means that I’m always bumping into things in the shop, but everyone’s learnt to laugh about it now.</p>
      <p>"A couple of times I’ve even walked into a customer but it’s always taken on the chin.</p>
      <p>“I just have to explain my situation and people are usually very understanding, especially the staff at Headway.”</p>

      <p>Mr Hales was asked to open a new Headway shop on Thursday (November 14) in High Street, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/">Beeston</a>.</p>
      <p>His wife Teresa, 54, a hairdresser, said: "Headway has given him the stability of having something to get up and go for everyday.</p>
      <p>"It's very important to Martin, otherwise he will feel worthless."</p>
      <p>Jo Plant, Headway’s director of fundraising, said: “We would like to thank our incredible team of staff and volunteers who worked tirelessly to get the shop ready for its big opening.</p>
      <p>“Martin has achieved so much since his brain injury and we’re honoured that he opened the shop for us.</p>
      <p>“All the money raised in the shop will help our charity to support people across the UK coming to terms with the devastating consequences of brain injury.</p>
      <p>“Like all the Headway shops, the Beeston store will rely entirely on stock donations and the selfless efforts of our volunteers."</p>
      <p>She added: "We’re always looking to welcome new volunteers to the team and we have lots of opportunities to get involved - whether it's greeting customers with a friendly smile, sorting through stock or manning the till.”</p>
