      <h1>Major Peter Mugure Sacked, To Be Held For 21 Days Pending Investigations</h1>

      <p>Major Peter Mwaura Mugure who was previously stationed at Laikipia Air Base, has been relieved of his duties.</p>
      <p>Nanyuki Law Court chief magistrate Lucy Mutai allowed police to hold Mugure and his co-accused Collins Pamba for 21 days pending investigations.</p>
      <p>The matter will be mentioned on December 9 for further direction.</p>
      <p>The Kenya Defense Forces officer has been sacked after the bodies of his estranged wife Joyce Syombua, their two children; Shanice Maua (10) and Prince Michael (5), were recovered at a cemetery in Thingithu area.</p>
      <p>Mugure was arrested on Friday evening after the three deceased persons were reported missing by friends and family.</p>
      <p>They were last seen on October 25 when they left their Kayole home to visit Mugure.</p>

      <p>Pamba is said to have helped the suspect get rid of the three bodies which were found tied up and in gunny bags.</p>
      <p>According to a local daily, Mugure, his colleagues have intimated was suffering from depression.</p>
      <p>“At one time while driving in the camp, I spotted him standing in the rain for over 30 minutes. He was being rained on and was constantly looking at his watch,” a source is quoted by the daily.</p>

      <p>At some point, he crashed an aeroplane as a trainee pilot, which could have been the start of his woes; mentally and personally.</p>
      <p>A postmortem exercise on the three bodies is expected to take place under the supervision of government pathologist Johansen Oduor.</p>
      <p>Samples collected from Mugure’s home, where he is believed to have committed the despicable act and cemetery are expected to be subjected to forensic analysis.</p>
