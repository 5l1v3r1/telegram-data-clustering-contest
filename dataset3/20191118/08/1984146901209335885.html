      <h1>Conor McLaughlin frustrated he will be missing for a spell out of the Sunderland team</h1>
      <h2>The Northern Ireland international will have missed at least three Sunderland games by the time he returns to the side</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T08:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 08:00</time> by <a rel="author">Sean McCormick</a></address>
      <p>Since Phil Parkinson took charge of Sunderland, Northern Ireland international Conor McLaughlin has played six out of seven matches when he has been available.</p>
      <p>But the 28-year-old, who joined the club on a free transfer from Millwall under previous manager <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/jack-ross">Jack Ross</a> in the summer, is set for a frustrating spell on the sidelines.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/conor-mclaughlin">McLaughlin</a> joined up with the Northern Ireland squad at the start of last week for their qualifiers against the Netherlands and Germany.</p>
      <p>As a result, he missed <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/sunderland-afc">Sunderland's</a> humiliating 3-0 defeat to Scunthorpe in the Leasing.com Trophy and he will also miss tomorrow's FA Cup first round replay against Gillingham.</p>
      <p>The former Preston and Fleetwood defender also picked up his fifth booking of the League One campaign against Southend and will miss this weekend's visit of Coventry through suspension.</p>
      <p>It means McLaughlin will not feature again for Sunderland until at least November 26 when Burton Albion make the trip up to the North East.</p>
      <p>"It will be frustrating, especially because I'll be suspended for the next league game as well," McLaughlin told Chronicle Live when asked about missing the Gillingham replay.</p>
      <p>"I might not play again for a few weeks, which is frustrating. A cup game I could have played in, but it's just one of those things.</p>
      <p>"I'm enjoying playing and it's just frustrating at the minute because in patches we're playing really well, but it's just keeping that going and being consistent. It's the first half, second half contrast and it's frustrating."</p>
      <p>It is not just at club level that McLaughlin has had to deal with a managerial change.</p>
      <p>Northern Ireland boss Michael O'Neill took over as manager of Stoke City earlier this month but is remaining as manager of the Green-and-White Army until the end of their EURO 2020 qualifying campaign.</p>
      <p>"It's been a mad few weeks really in terms of managers really," McLaughlin added.</p>
      <p>"Obviously Michael at Northern Ireland has done unbelievably well over the last seven or eight years and he deserves a chance at club management. I'm sure he'll go on to do well there."Â </p>
