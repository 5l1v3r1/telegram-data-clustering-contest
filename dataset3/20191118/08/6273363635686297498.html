      <h1>Google Stadia will launch with 22 games on first day, up from just 12 last week</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T08:19:57+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 08:19</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://venturebeat.com/author/dean-takahashi/" target="_blank">Dean Takahashi</a></address>
      <p>Google <a href="https://www.blog.google/products/stadia/lineup-games-coming-to-stadia/">announced</a> tonight that its <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/10/24/stadia-studio-montreal/">Stadia cloud-gaming service</a> will launch on November 19 (yes, Tuesday) with 22 titles, up from just 12 last week.</p>
      <p>I’m not sure what changed so fast to allow Google to add 10 more titles, but last week’s announcement of just 12 titles was greeted as a pathetic line-up. Now Stadia has a much broader set of games to please more gamers.</p>
      <p>“Alongside our publisher and developer partners, we’ve been working around the clock on getting ready for Stadia’s launch, and we are adding more incredible titles to our day one launch line-up,” the Stadia team said in an email. “Gamers will have a total of 22 titles available to choose from to experience Stadia for the first time on Tuesday, with more games coming by the end of the year.”</p>
      <p>In addition, gamers will be able to claim both Destiny 2: The Collection and Samurai Shodown as part of the November Stadia Pro subscription.</p>
      <p>Stadia’s day one titles include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Assassin’s Creed Odyssey</li>
        <li>Attack on Titan: Final Battle 2</li>
        <li>Destiny 2: The Collection (available in Stadia Pro)</li>
        <li>Farming Simulator 2019</li>
        <li>Final Fantasy XV</li>
        <li>Football Manager 2020</li>
        <li>Grid 2019</li>
        <li>Gylt</li>
        <li>Just Dance 2020</li>

      <p>Additional games expected to be playable on Stadia by the end of the year include Borderlands 3, Ghost Recon: Breakpoint, Dragon Ball: Xenoverse, and Darksiders Genesis.</p>
