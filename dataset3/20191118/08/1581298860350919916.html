      <h1>Farmers Across Borders to support West Australian farmers on 2020 Hay Run</h1>

      <p>With preparations underway for its upcoming Australia Day Hay Run, Farmers Across Borders is calling for support to help the state's struggling farmers.</p>
      <p>In January, the Esperance based group led a colossal fleet of 50 road trains across the country to deliver 3000 tonnes of feed to drought stricken farmers in New South Wales.</p>
      <p>This year, the group will shift focus to farmers within its own state, delivering fodder across the Northern Goldfields, Gascoyne and Murchison regions.</p>
      <p>The group has been carting hay on single truck runs to farmers in the Murchison throughout the year.</p>
      <p>Chairperson Sam Starcevich said the plight of farmers in our backyards was too difficult to ignore.</p>
      <p>"We are doing WA first this time and the guys over east desperately need it, but we have to look after our own as well," she said.</p>
      <p>"We've been carting all year until we've run out of hay, it's been continually happening just not with the convoy.</p>
      <p>"There is a huge part of WA that hasn't had rainfall for the past 12 months, there's livestock dying because they don't have feed, and they need to be helped."</p>
      <p>She said the group was busy bailing donated fodder and raising funds to fuel the January run.</p>
      <p>"We are frantically trying to raise enough money to actually cart it all," she said.</p>
      <p>"We are raising money to pay for fuel because how much we raise determines how many trucks we can take."</p>
      <p>Mrs Starcevich said it was difficult to predict the cost per truck with changes in diesel prices, however, the estimated cost was at least $4,000.</p>
      <p>With the group hoping to have more than 20 triple trailer trucks on the road, they are calling for support.</p>
      <p>Mrs Starcevich said despite a groundswell of community donations, the state government needed to do more to support struggling farmers.</p>
      <p>She said last year's fuel was covered by Lions Need for Feed and subsidies from the NSW government, however, no subsidy had yet been provided by the WA government for this year's run.</p>
      <p>"They need to declare a drought and give us some funding because it is an animal welfare issue, it needs to be addressed and we need some help," she said.</p>
      <p>"We are getting all this feed and fodder donated, the least our government could do is help with some sort of fuel subsidy to help cart it, we can't just rely on the generosity of West Australians."</p>
      <p>Agriculture and Food Minister Alannah MacTiernan said she would meet with Farmers Across Borders next week to discuss the upcoming hay run.</p>
      <p>"Farmers Across Borders provide great support and a real morale boost, and we welcome their support for West Australian pastoralists struggling with the dry season," she said.</p>
      <p>"The State Government has a dry season response program underway and we are working closely with pastoralists to support seasonal management and decisions."</p>
      <p>Minister MacTiernan said departmental officers had visited more than 100 pastoral properties across the State since July to ensure pastoralists are prepared for the ongoing dry season to avoid animal welfare issues.</p>
      <p>"Destocking, purchasing external feed or investing in water infrastructure are business decisions for individual pastoralists - while Government can support that decision-making, we cannot do the business of farming," she said.</p>
      <p>"Last week we announced additional support measures for southern rangelands pastoralists, including an extra $150,000 for feral herbivore control - which pastoralists have told us is the key issue in managing the season."</p>
      <p>Minister MacTiernan said pastoralists concerned about having sufficient feed to ensure their animals' welfare should contact <a href="https://www.agric.wa.gov.au/2019-northern-pastoral-season">DPIRD's dry season response group</a>.</p>
