        <b>Our Irish chef revs up for Thanksgiving with this sweet, warming soup that's simple to make and sure to be enjoyed by all the family.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Each year, especially during fall and in the run-up to Thanksgiving, I’m reminded once again how versatile this veggie-like fruit is. You can roast it, boil it, steam it -- and puree it into soups just like this one. It also freezes well, so you can keep a stash in the freezer to make this soup all year round.</p>
