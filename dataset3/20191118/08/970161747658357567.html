      <p>Dr Hilary Jones has debunked <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/prince-andrew-duke-of-york/">Prince Andrew</a>’s defence that he ‘couldn’t sweat’ after he used it as his defence</p>
      <p>In a sensational Newsnight interview with Emily Maitlis this weekend, Andrew tried to shoot down claims that he was sweaty in a nightclub in 2001, when he allegedly met and slept with Virginia Roberts (now Giuffre), stating <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/prince-andrew-says-sex-claims-cant-true-cant-sweat-11170147/">he had a condition that stopped him from doing so</a>.</p>
      <p>Mrs Guiffre has accused Prince Andrew of sleeping with her when she was 17, during which time she claims to have been sex trafficked by billionaire paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.</p>

      <p>But Andrew, confronting the allegations, said her vivid memory of him being sweaty in a nightclub couldn’t have been true as he was unable to sweat at all after ‘an adrenaline overdose during the Falklands war.’</p>
      <p>Speaking on Good Morning Britain, Dr Hilary Jones did not buy Prince Andrew’s claims, stating his explanation left him sceptical at best.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘It’s an extraordinary claim, because there’s only three things that can cause this condition called anhidrosis or hyperhidrosis.’</p>
      <p>‘Firstly it can be congenital, which is clearly isn’t in this case,’ he explained.</p>

      <p>‘Secondly it can be a prelue to something like heatstroke, where you’re so empty of bodily fluids you can’t sweat. Clearly it isn’t the case here.</p>
      <p>‘There’s a third explanation, which is that simply he had an injury or some kind of serious condition which would effect his whole body which, again, clearly isn’t the case.’</p>
      <p>The professional then continued: ‘As for the adrenaline thing in the Falklands, it doesn’t make sense, because sweating isn’t mediated by adrenaline, it’s mediated by acetylcholine.’</p>

      <p>When pressed by Piers, Dr Jones confirmed he was ‘absolutely sceptical’.</p>
      <p>While acknowledging claims such as the one Prince Andrew claimed that he has, he added: ‘It’s very, very rare indeed.</p>
      <p>‘I’ve never seen a case.’</p>

      <p>During today’s GMB, Piers Morgan slammed Prince Andrew for his ‘demonstrable lies’ in the interview, in which he came up with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/18/piers-morgan-slams-prince-andrew-telling-demonstrable-lies-damaging-bbc-interview-11173217/">numerous reasons for his connection with Epstein. </a></p>
      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/15/prince-andrew-says-let-side-staying-jeffrey-epstein-11165935/">In the catastrophic interview,</a> he discussed his friendship with the accused sex trafficker, who died by suspected suicide while being held ahead of trial.</p>
      <p>Andrew, who had been photographed with Epstein in Central Park after the businessman had been convicted for the prostitution of minors in 2010, said he’d ‘let the side down’ by maintaining the friendship.</p>
