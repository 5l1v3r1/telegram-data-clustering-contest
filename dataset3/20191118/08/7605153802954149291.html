        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya, Nov 18 – A section of leaders in Kisumu are now demanding for the immediate arrest of individuals who were involved in the gruesome murders of six bouncers lynched last week during the burial service of businessman Johannes Okoth Aduol in Bumula, Busia county.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Members of County Assembly (MCAs) led by Migosi MCA Victor Rodgers Monday asked the Inspector General of Police Hillary Mutyambai to speed up the arrests of the suspects involved in the murder subsequent arraignment in court.</p>
      <p>ADVERTISEMENT</p>
      <p>Milimani MCA Seth Kanga who also doubles up as the coordinator of the Kisumu Bouncers Association has decried the negative publicity that has been associated with bouncers even as he appealed for a speedy investigation process noting that the suspects are well known to the members of the community.</p>
      <p>Kisumu Bouncers Association Spokesperson Edgar Ochieng has given the police seven days to effect the arrests of the suspects failure to which will be forced to take the law upon themselves.</p>
      <p>The six bouncers who hailed from Kisumu were contracted by the family of the deceased to provide security but unfortunately met their untimely demise moments after the burial with the locals claiming that they were strangers during the burial ceremony.</p>
