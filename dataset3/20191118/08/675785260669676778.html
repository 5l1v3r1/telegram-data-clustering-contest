      <h2>Students remain trapped in Polytechnic University in Hong Kong and police have warned they'll use live ammunition if anyone continues to protest in a tense showdown</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T08:48:04+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 08:48</time> by <a rel="author">Bradley Jolly, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/bradley-jolly/</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/police">Police</a> have trapped around 800 students inside a Hong Kong university and have threatened to use live bullets on those who fail to surrender.</p>
      <p>The anti-government protesters at the sprawling Polytechnic University remain holed up, fearful of police with water cannons, ammunition and armoured vehicles.</p>
      <p>Officers used teargas last night in what has become one of the most prolonged and tense confrontations between police and demonstrators in more than five months of political unrest.</p>
      <p>And police threatened to fire "rioters" with live bullets today.</p>
      <p>The terrified students countered the volleys of teargas and rubber bullets with gasoline bombs, slingshots and bows and arrows.</p>

      <p>Several of the demonstrators have been arrested.</p>
      <p>But others have managed to hide under umbrellas and shields made out of debris.</p>
      <p>Democratic lawmaker Hui Chi-fung said: "The police might not storm the campus but it seems like they are trying to catch people as they attempt to run.</p>
      <p>"It’s not optimistic now. They might all be arrested on campus. Lawmakers and school management are trying to liaise with the police but failed."</p>

      <p>Witnesses said students are determined not to surrender.</p>
      <p>"Officially, they are saying people have to leave now, and even pointing out some ways to let you out. But when people try to leave that way, they contain them. It’s a set-up," Tang Siu Wa, a volunteer with the Protect the Children group, told <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/18/hong-kong-protests-up-to-800-trapped-as-police-lay-siege-to-university">The Guardian</a> .</p>
      <p>The 41-year-old added: "People getting tired but they don’t want to surrender."</p>

      <p>A spokesman for the university's Student Union said: "Because most of the emergency relief team and first-aiders have been arrested and taken away, there are insufficient resources and personnel within campus to treat the injured. </p>
      <p>He called the situation "a severe humanitarian crisis".</p>
      <p>Protesters have blocked one of the city's major arteries, the Cross-Harbour Tunnel linking Hong Kong island to the Kowloon peninsula, for much of the past week.</p>
