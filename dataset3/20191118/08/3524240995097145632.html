      <h1>Ruiz vs AJ II in Saudi may be Anthony Joshua’s last fight</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T08:09:19+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 08:09</time> by <a rel="author">Agency Report</a></address>
      <p>In what could prove to be Anthony Joshua’s final fight, the Briton’s team have been accused of cashing out following a loss to Andy Ruiz Jr.</p>
      <p>Joshua was dropped multiple times and stopped in New York earlier this year, leading to promoter Eddie Hearn invoking the immediate rematch clause.</p>
      <p>Despite being the favourite, there are rumours Joshua will walk away – win or lose, after trading blows in Saudi Arabia on December 7.</p>
      <p>Fans believe the clearest indication of this has come with the inflated UK Pay-Per-View price. Ruiz vs Joshua II has been confirmed at £24.95, five pounds above the usual tag.</p>
      <p>Reading between the lines, some see it as Joshua and his representatives taking advantage of what could be the final nail in the former champion’s career.</p>
