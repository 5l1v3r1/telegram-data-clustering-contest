      <h1>Jose Mourinho was warned Romelu Lukaku is a 'big baby' before Man Utd transfer</h1>
      <h2>Manchester United brought in Romelu Lukaku from Everton in the summer of 2017 but left two years later for Inter Milan</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T08:03:53+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 08:03</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Jose Mourinho was warned about signing Romelu Lukaku for Manchester United.</p>
      <p>Lukaku arrived at Old Trafford in a £75m deal from <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> in 2017 but left just two years later for Inter Milan.</p>
      <p>After a decent start to his United career, Lukaku's form dipped and he found himself out of the plans of boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.</p>
      <p>Mourinho was the man to bring the Belgian in, having worked with him at <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> before he left for Everton.</p>
      <p>Before the transfer was completed, Everton director of football Steve Walsh had some advice for Mourinho having worked with him previously at Stamford Bridge.</p>

      <p>“When Jose signed Romelu Lukaku from Everton, I remember saying to him, ‘You have to be careful with Lukaku. He is a big baby, you know," <a href="https://theathletic.co.uk/1383451/2019/11/18/i-said-to-mourinho-you-have-to-be-careful-with-lukaku-hes-a-big-baby-walsh-on-managers-players-and-proving-vardy-wrong-about-frenchmen/">Walsh told the Athletic.</a></p>
      <p>"He said he could handle him. I don’t think he really got Lukaku on-side mentally, which you have to do."</p>
      <p>Walsh doesn't believe Mourinho was able to do that with Lukaku or teammate Paul Pogba, who were both out of sorts before he was sacked last December.</p>
      <p>"That is the case with him and Paul Pogba. They aren’t my type of players. They are more about themselves than the team," Walsh added.</p>

      <p>"I wouldn’t have touched them. Because they are good players doesn’t mean you are going to get a good team out of it."</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Lukaku has claimed Ole Gunnar Solskjaer wanted him to remain at the club, but he had decided his time was up.</p>
      <p>The Belgian striker, who is enjoying a decent start at Inter Milan, admits he had told Solskjaer he wanted to go last March.</p>
