      <h1>Refreshed Mitsubishi Mirage, Attrage Break Cover In Thailand</h1>
      <h2>Similar improvements can be expected for the U.S. market.</h2>

      <p>With a starting price of just $13,795, the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/mitsubishi/mirage/">Mitsubishi Mirage</a> is one of the cheapest (if not <i>the</i> cheapest) new car money can buy in the United States today. It’s also the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/features/228496/most-fuel-efficient-cars/">most fuel-efficient non-hybrid vehicle</a> sold in the country for the 2019 model year, and the good news is that it’s <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/276359/mitsubishi-mirage-lancer-planned/">here to stay</a> – or that’s what we tend to believe after seeing the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/category/facelift/">facelifted</a> Mirage and <a href="https://www.motor1.com/news/38827/2014-mitsubishi-attrage-revealed/">Attrage</a> (<a href="https://www.motor1.com/mitsubishi/mirage-g4/">Mirage G4</a> in America) for the Thai market.</p>
      <p>While the subcompact model remains instantly recognizable, it now features a more mature front fascia thanks to the adoption of Mitsubishi’s Dynamic Shield design language with a dominating X-shaped radiator grille. Also new are the headlights, which now feature a revised layout with standard projector lenses and integrated LED daytime running lights.</p>

      <p>At the back, both the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/body-styles/hatchback/">hatchback</a> and the <a href="https://www.motor1.com/body-styles/sedan/">sedan</a> now appear slightly wider due to the new squarish treatment for the bumper corners and the modified L-signature horizontal LED lamps that stretch across the width of the car. Both come with new 15-inch wheels with two-tone diamond-cut styling on the Mirage and a traditional silver finish on the Attrage.</p>

      <p>Inside the cabin, the duo gets softer materials and a redesigned front armrest for all trim levels, while the more expensive models also benefit from a special seat design. More importantly, the models receive a new infotainment system with a seven-inch display, which supports both Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.</p>

      <p>No hardware upgrades are reported at this point, which means the Mirage and Attrage continue to be powered by a three-cylinder naturally-aspirated 1.2-liter gas engine good for 78 horsepower and 74 pound-feet of torque. This motor is the only available choice in the United States as well, where you can have it with a continuously variable transmission for an EPA fuel efficiency numbers of 36 miles per gallon in the city, 43 mpg highway, and 39 mpg.</p>
      <p>The first public appearance of the refreshed duo is scheduled for the Thailand International Motor Expo later this month and Mitsubishi says “sales in other markets will follow sequentially.”</p>

The styling sweeps round from the sides toward the middle of the nose in a protective embrace. This and the square grille lines with its horizontal/vertical bar pattern, give the front end a more powerful and sharper look.<br/>· The optimized lamp layout makes the front look wider and more stable. The styling of the multi-bulb LED combination lamps connects them visually with the grille and with the fog lamps located at the bumper corners.<br/>· The rear is given a wider and more stable look with a squarish treatment for the bumper corners and with the L-signature horizontal LED combination lamps that stretch across the width of the car.<br/>· Both Mirage and Attrage are offered in a new White Diamond body color that has a brilliance and depth to it. The Mirage palette is given a new bright and fresh Sand Yellow.<br/>· Both Mirage and Attrage are offered with new-design 15-inch alloy wheels. On Mirage, the wheels use two-tone diamond-cut styling, while on Attrage they use an elegant silver finish.<br/> <br/>2) More user-friendly, stylish interiors<br/>· The front arm rests use a new design, and hand-touch areas are finished in soft-feel cloth.<br/>· The meter panel and the power window switch panel use a sporty carbon pattern.<br/>· Upper-trim levels are offered with a special seat design. For Mirage, these are upholstered in a sporty-look fabric/synthetic leather combination. For Attrage, they use an elegant monotone design with synthetic leather. The addition of piping and stitching to the seat sides on both models gives an added touch of elegance.<br/>· Newly adopted Smartphone Display Audio (SDA) system with 7-inch display improves legibility and clarity.
