        <b>The future of Pep Guardiola at Manchester City is reportedly in some doubt due to confusion over the terms of his current contract.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Spanish tactician has been a big hit at the Etihad Stadium and would be a huge loss if he were to leave the club any time soon.</p>

      <p>Having enjoyed great success at Barcelona and Bayern Munich, Guardiola has followed that up with further silverware at City, though this season is proving a bit more of a challenge than the previous two.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/pep-guardiola-man-city-contract-20896453">Daily Mirror</a> explain that there is some confusion over whether or not Guardiola has a get-out clause in his MCFC deal, which expires in 2021.</p>
      <p>The 48-year-old was linked with a return to Bayern recently, and there’s also a bizarre claim being made that he could be an option for Liverpool once Jurgen Klopp leaves.</p>
      <p>This seems to be more opinion than speculation from <a href="https://www.liverpool.com/liverpool-fc-news/features/klopp-guardiola-pochettino-liverpool-job-17271721">Liverpool.com</a>, though they employ several quality journalists with inside info on the goings-on at Anfield.</p>
      <p>The writer suggests there’s no reason the Reds would not consider a future move for Guardiola in the right circumstances.</p>
      <p>LFC fans would also surely take him, with his style of football likely to go down well and with his record of success meaning they’d be in a good position to continue to improve on what Klopp has done.</p>
