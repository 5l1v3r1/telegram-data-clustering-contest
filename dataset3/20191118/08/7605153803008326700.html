        <b>NAIROBI, Kenya Nov 18 – Safaricom has announced new internet packages which seek to provide uninterrupted, high-speed connectivity for small to medium-sized businesses at affordable costs.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Under the new pricing structure, the company has introduced three new options from as low as KES 3,999 for 3 Mbps monthly unlimited internet connectivity delivered through Safaricom Fibre. The other options in the new package include KES 5,499 for 5 Mbps and KES 14,999 for 10 Mbps.</p>

      <p>“As part of our new brand promise, we committed to be Simple, Transparent and Honest across all our products and operations. As part of this pledge we are renewing our promise to our Enterprise customers by introducing packages that suit their business needs, optimising our response time and by ensuring we deliver simple solutions with easy and transparent processes,” said Michael Joseph, CEO, Safaricom.</p>
      <p>Safaricom has already connected close to 3,000 buildings to its proprietary fibre infrastructure and plans to have another 1,500 buildings connected by March 2020.</p>
      <p>Last month Safaricom marked 19 years since the company launched by unveiling a new strategy and renewing its commitment to its customers. As part of the brand refresh campaign, Safaricom introduced a single calling and SMS plan, and a single data plan for all customers and in an industry first, both plans offer calling minutes and SMS, and data bundles with no expiry</p>
      <p>Customers can also purchase calling minutes, SMS, and data bundles for any amount from as low as KES 1, upon which they can see how much resources they will get before the purchase is completed.</p>
      <p>The company also increased its data bundle sizes by more than 45 percent especially for the more affordable price points of between Sh1 and Sh20 and in addition to the Data Manager where customers can choose between higher and lower data speeds, Safaricom will also inform customers when they are charged for premium services.</p>
