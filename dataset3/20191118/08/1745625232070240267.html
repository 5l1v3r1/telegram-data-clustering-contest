      <p>The 'Blackheart' also revealed why WWE reunited him with then-rival Johnny Gargano during the few weeks they wrestled on 'Monday Night Raw' and 'SmackDown Live.'</p>
      <p>Although Tommaso Ciampa appears to have re-established himself as a key member of the <i><a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/tag/nxt/">NXT</a></i> roster as the black-and-gold brand continues drifting further from its developmental origins, he was, for a very brief period of time, part of <a href="https://inquisitr.com/tag/wwe">WWE</a>‘s main roster earlier this year. Given how little fanfare there was ahead of the quick call-up, Ciampa recently commented on the temporary main roster promotion, explaining the possible decision behind the move.</p>
      <p>As explained by <a href="https://wrestlingnews.co/wwe-news/tommaso-ciampa-on-why-he-thinks-wwe-called-him-up-to-the-main-roster-earlier-this-year/"><i>WrestlingNews.co</i></a>, Ciampa, Johnny Gargano, Ricochet, and Aleister Black were all called up in February, with the former two notably teaming up despite being onscreen rivals on <i>NXT</i> at the time. While Ricochet and Black stuck it out on the main roster, Ciampa <a href="https://www.inquisitr.com/5319787/wwe-rumors-tommaso-ciampas-injury-could-be-more-serious-than-once-thought-per-pwinsider/">suffered a neck injury</a> that required him to take several months off, and Gargano was brought back to <i>NXT</i>. And with the “Blackheart” now back on the black-and-gold brand as he tries to regain the <i>NXT</i> Championship he relinquished due to his injury, he recently appeared on the <i>State of Combat</i> podcast to discuss why he and his colleagues were surprisingly called up to the main roster.</p>
      <p>“As far as Ricochet, Aleister (Black), myself and Johnny Gargano being on the main roster, there wasn’t a lot of explanation, to be honest with you,” Ciampa said, as quoted by <i>WrestlingNews.co</i>.</p>
      <blockquote>“Sometimes, there are spots that need to be filled and you just have to be at the right spot at the right time or the wrong spot and the wrong time.”</blockquote>

      <p>Considering how several main-roster superstars were injured in the lead-up to <i>WrestleMania 35</i>, Ciampa added that WWE felt it was a “good opportunity” for him and other top <i>NXT</i> stars to get some much-needed exposure and help draw attention toward the company ahead of its biggest pay-per-view of the year.</p>
      <p>After further explaining that he believes WWE needed some fresh new talents onscreen in the lead-up to <i>WrestleMania 35,</i> Ciampa admitted that there was some “backlash” due to how the company seemingly ignored his <i>NXT</i> storyline with Gargano and had both men reunite as a tag team. While he acknowledged that their onscreen feud was gaining a lot of traction on <i>NXT</i>, he added that he felt it was more important for him to do what WWE’s creative team wanted him to do.</p>
      <p>“Maybe it would have played out a certain way, I think it would have. I kind of trust the process here, but yeah, I don’t ask a lot of questions,” Ciampa continued. “I just go out and do my job and at that time my job was to show up and perform on <i>Raw</i> and perform on <i>SmackDown</i> and do my job.”</p>
