      <h2>Latest Derby County transfer news | The January transfer is edging ever closer and the Rams will be thinking about what players can either bring in or let go</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T08:02:07+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 08:02</time> by <a rel="author">Mark Wakefield</a></address>
      <p>The January transfer window is just around the corner, and clubs around Europe will be setting up their plans for the month.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county">Derby County</a> will be one of those clubs who may chose to dip into the transfer market in the New Year.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.derbytelegraph.co.uk/all-about/derby-county">Rams </a>are currently in 16th place in the Sky Bet Championship table, and may want to add to their squad in January in order to bolster their squad for the second half of the season.</p>
      <p>But what about players heading in the other direction?</p>
      <p>Last week we asked Rams fans to choose which players to remain at the club in January, and which they think should head out of the exit door.</p>
      <p>Derby supporters have voted to allow nine players to leave Pride Park during the next transfer window.</p>
      <p>Ikechi Anya (7.1%), Floran Jozefzoon (9.1%) and George Thorne (15.3%) received the lowest percentage of votes from those wishing for them to remain at Derby beyond January.</p>
