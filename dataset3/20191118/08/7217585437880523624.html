      <h1>Cell C’s 4G coverage will be even greater thanks to latest MTN deal</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T08:56:36+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 08:56</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Walker</a></address>
      <p>Cell C and MTN on Monday announced a new roaming agreement, building on and extending the firms’ previous agreement made in 2018, and pushing Cell C’s LTE coverage further across South Africa.</p>
      <p>Last year’s deal saw Cell C’s network coverage extend to areas beyond South Africa’s largest cities, but the new agreement will push Cell C’s coverage to 95% of the South African population, on the back of MTN’s network infrastructure.</p>
      <p>This also means nearly 90% LTE coverage for Cell C customers, but the two provides will continue to use their respective frequencies and have control over their own customers’ experience.</p>
      <p>“This is a pivotal step in Cell C’s turnaround strategy,” said Douglas Craigie Stevenson, Cell C CEO.</p>
      <p>“One of the key pillars of this turnaround is to implement a revised network strategy that enables Cell C to manage its network capacity requirements in a more cost efficient and scalable manner.”</p>
      <p>Stevenson believes that the deal will allow Cell C to avoid building expensive network infrastructure, and focus on “developing innovative and disruptive service offerings that will be welcomed by data hungry consumers”.</p>
      <p>The roaming agreement won’t be felt by Cell C customers immediately. It could take up to three years to implement, beginning in early 2020.</p>
