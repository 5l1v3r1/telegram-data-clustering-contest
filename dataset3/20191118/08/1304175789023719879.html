      <p>With UK tourists spending £45.4 billion abroad in the past year alone, we are spending more money than ever on our trips away. Holidays can involve some strict budgeting to make sure funds can cover the cost of accommodation, entertainment, food and drink whilst abroad. Starling, a leading digital bank, has created a handy interactive <a href="https://www.starlingbank.com/blog/most-affordable-cities-to-visit/">travel calculator</a>  that shows people how far a £100 daily budget can get them around the world. </p>
      <p>With the current weakness in the value of the pound against major currencies making overseas travel more expensive, UK tourists are keen to get the best value they can from their holiday money. The tool allows savvy explorers to compare prices of food, accommodation and entertainment in different cities around the world with just a few clicks. Users are able to fill up their budget by selecting from many different options including bottles of water and taxi rides.</p>
      <p><b>Most affordable cities to explore in a day</b><br/>By analysing four of the same metrics - three local meals, one round trip on public transport, the average attraction entry cost and a hotel for a night - Starling were able to provide a clear view of the most cost-efficient cities.</p>
      <p>Delhi takes the top spot as the cheapest city to visit, with a day here coming in at £28.22. This covers three local meals (£8.52), a round trip on public transport (£0.69), a hotel stay (£15.80) and average entry cost to a top-rated attraction (£3.21). Visitors can visit the India Gate, a war memorial, and Jama Masjid, one of the largest mosques in India, are both free to the public.</p>
