      <p>At a top hacking competition (Tianfu Cup) that took place over the last weekend in China, Microsoft’s <a href="https://twitter.com/TianfuCup/status/1195532310025625601">Edge web browser was hacked thrice</a>. The good news is that the hacked Edge browser is based on Microsoft’s own EdgeHTML rendering engine. As you already know, Microsoft is replacing the old Edge browser with a new one which is based on Google’s Chromium browser engine. At the hacking competition, several other products were successfully hacked. Google’s Chrome browser was successfully exploited twice, Apple’s Safari web browser once and <a href="https://twitter.com/TianfuCup/status/1195576069446746113">Microsoft Office 365</a> once.</p>
      <p>Team 360Vulcan won the competition by earning $382,500 for exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft Edge, Microsoft Office 365, qemu+Ubuntu, Adobe PDF Reader, and VMWare Workstation.</p>
