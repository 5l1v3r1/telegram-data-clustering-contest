      <h4>Chelsea will hear about the fate of the January window soon. With a supposed war chest, we asked our contributors for their targets on a budget.</h4>
      <p>The size Chelsea’s supposed war chest has varied but has consistently been in the €150 million range. So we asked our contributors to use<a href="https://football-observatory.com/-values-61092"><b> CIES Football Observatory</b></a> values and <a href="https://www.transfermarkt.com/"><b>Transfermarkt</b></a> values to name their transfer targets using that war chest. Who would we spend that cash on?</p>
      <h3>Bernardo Silva (€120M) and Alex Telles (€30M) – Varun Dani</h3>
      <p>Chelsea has two positions that require some upgrading; a winger to replace Pedro and a left back to replace Marcos Alonso. To this extent, Bernardo Silva and Alex Telles would be excellent upgrades.</p>
      <p>It is easy to go along the Jadon Sancho hype when it comes to purchasing a new attacker. He is an exquisite talent, but I would want the club to take a more calculated approach and find a player with some unique qualities. Sancho is quite similar to Christian Pulisic and Callum Hudson-Odoi in being a pacey, direct winger but not truly being very different from them.</p>
      <p>This Chelsea squad, for all its depth, only has three left footers making them rather predictable at times. If the club was to spend big money on a winger, they should do it to acquire a skill set nobody at the club possess. Enter Bernardo Silva.</p>
      <p>A majestic dribbler and massive goal contributor, Silva would thrive on the right side of Chelsea’s attack, which is also his preferred position. He was Manchester City’s best player last season and is criminally underrated. As a wide playmaker, Silva would add the Juan Mata-esque magic touch the squad currently lacks. Aged 25, he would be a player in the prime of his career who would perform instantly to complement the patience required with Pulisic and Hudson-Odoi.</p>
      <p>Alex Telles on the other hand comes from a long line of excellent Brazilian left backs, excellent offensively and defensively. He is pacey, skillful and physical, making him the perfect rival for Emerson. His set piece prowess would match that of Alonso’s.</p>
      <p>I would prefer the club makes these signings in the summer, rather than the winter, to give them an entire preseason to settle.</p>
