      <p>Taiwan-based heat dissipation solution provider Forcecon Technology has introduced a new form of heat pipe, thermal ground plane (TGP), thickened 0.2mm for notebook and smartphone applications, according to company chairman Yao Cheng-chi.</p>
      <p>The company has delivered its TGP devices to notebook and smartphone clients for verification, likely paving the way for volume shipments in the first quarter of 2020, Yao said.</p>
      <p>Its initial production of TGPs will reach 200,000 units, with output to be ramped up depending on market demand, Yao added.</p>
      <p>Since TGP products can come with a thickness of 0.2mm or even 0.1mm, the TGP-based cooling solutions boast an advantage when applied to slim consumer electronics products as compared to vaper chamber (VC)-based modules, which are now available with a thickness of 0.35mm, Yao said.</p>
      <p>In the third quarter of 2019, Forcecon posted revenues of NT$3.564 billion (US$116.88 million), net profit of NT$117 million and gross margin of 18.3%.</p>
