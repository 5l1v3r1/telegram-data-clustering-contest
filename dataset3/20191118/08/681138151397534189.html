      <p>The event has been organised by Judge Rupert Overbury, Suffolk's Diversity and Community Relations judge, who has written a script entitled "The trial of Lucy/Luke Lyre".</p>
      <p>During the competition pupils will play a number of different roles, including the judge, barristers, victim and defendant in their own courtroom drama.</p>
      <p>Judge Overbury will be making a wooden wig stand which will be presented to the winning school and this year's competition is being supported by Birketts LLP who have donated a prize fund which will provide book vouchers for the finalists and a memento for each pupil taking part in the final.</p>

      <p>Judge Overbury will also donate small prizes for the best school press reporter and court artist.</p>
      <p>More than 20 schools from across the county have entered the competition with all but one attending Ipswich Crown Court on seven dates over the next four months.</p>
      <p>The first round of the competition takes place this month and the final will be on March 27 next year.</p>
      <p>"Last year's competition was an outstanding success and the feedback from teachers and pupils was very positive and encouraging," said Judge Overbury.</p>
      <p>"I firmly believe that educating primary school children about the justice system is very important to their understanding of the community and giving them an opportunity to perform in a real courtroom brings reality to that learning and boosts their confidence in public," he added.</p>
      <p>Last year's competition was won by St Mark's Catholic Primary School from Ipswich.</p>
      <p>The Year 5 pupils were up against students from Palgrave Primary School, near Diss, in the final round of the competition.</p>
      <p>The schools taking part in the competition this year are: Ipswich High School Juniors; Chilton Primary, Stowmarket; St. Mary's Catholic, Ipswich; Handford Hall, Ipswich; Bardwell Primary; Elm Tree, Lowestoft; Walsham Le Willows; Gusford, Ipswich; Holbrook; Palgrave; Bramfield, Horringer; Lavenham; St Mark's Catholic, Ipswich; Great Woods Primary, Brampton; Bures; Wickhambrook; St. Mary's Hadleigh; Cliff Lane, Ipswich and Stanton.</p>
