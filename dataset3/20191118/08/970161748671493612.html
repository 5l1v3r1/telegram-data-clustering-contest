      <p>A two-week-old baby reportedly died after staff in an Australian jail refused to provide care – because she was ‘not an inmate’.</p>
      <p>The alleged incident – in one of the country’s most notorious jails in August last year – saw the baby left for around 30 minutes before a nurse arrived, having been discovered unconscious.</p>
      <p>Inmates told <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7683161/Newborn-baby-died-inside-maximum-security-womens-jail-refused-help-guards.html">Daily Mail Australia</a> that prison staff at the Dame Phyllis Frost Centre’s dedicated ‘Mothers and Children Units’ have been accused by inmates of refusing to help the 14-day-old girl.</p>
      <p>The maximum security prison – which is home to various high profile prisoners, including the ‘black widow’ killer Robyn Lindholm – allows children to live with their mum until they are six.</p>
      <p>But prisoners say the night-time tragedy saw staff fail to help the youngster, while one inmate tried in vain to resuscitate it.</p>

      <p>They told the paper that prisoners woke to a young Vietnamese mum screaming hysterically as the child lay motionless on a couch.</p>

      <p>The guards were called but allegedly did not attend for 15 minutes, before alerting the nurse. It reportedly took another 10-15 minutes for the nurse to arrive – and it is unclear whether the baby was still alive at that point.</p>
      <p>But inmates say the nurse then refused to even touch the child, suggesting she was not allowed to because the baby was ‘not an inmate’.</p>
      <p>The Department of Justice and Community Safety declined to address a number of allegations but said Police would investigate and provide a report for the Coroner.</p>
      <p>The Victoria jail is said to have been put on ‘lock down’ for four days after the death, as the authorities attempted to work out what had happened.</p>

      <p>Many of the children’s dads take them out of the prison to receive medical attention because of delays in getting treated, sources said.</p>
      <p>Corrections Victoria, which runs the jail, says the accommodation for mums and kids ‘meets acceptable community standards for the safe and secure housing of children and adequately meets the nutritional, developmental and health needs of the child’, adding that a nurse visits regularly to keep up to date with children’s health.</p>
      <p>But an unnamed source told Daily Mail Australia that buying anything for children, including medication, needs staff approval – which can take time.</p>
      <p>Inmates also suggested babies do not receive routine check-ups amid staff shortages, with many appointments being delayed.</p>

      <p>A source told the paper: ‘What really frightens me is that there is going to be more infants coming in. If nothing changes, if basic first aid isn’t administered or someone is calling up at 2am and their baby has got an ear ache that could burst or something, can’t see the prison doctor for days on end, it’s only a matter of time before another baby dies.’</p>
