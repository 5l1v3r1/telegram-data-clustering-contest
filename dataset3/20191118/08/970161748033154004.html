      <p>Lorraine Kelly was not impressed by Jennifer Arcuri’s answers during her Good Morning Britain interview with Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid and made her opinion very clear as her show crossed over to the studio.</p>
      <p>Jennifer had joined the programme to discuss how she was treated by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/boris-johnson/">Boris Johnson</a> and the media scrutiny of their relationship, and the 59-year-old presenter didn’t hold back her thoughts as she was welcomed onto their airwaves.</p>
      <p>Yep, it was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/09/30/lorraine-kelly-shades-esther-mcvey-piers-morgan-living-10831043/">like the Esther McVey shade all over again</a>.</p>

      <p>‘That was crazy, wasn’t it?’ Lorraine began. ‘What’s the point? Coming down and not answering any questions. What’s the point in that?’</p>
      <p>She continued: ‘It just doesn’t make any sense. What’s the point in you coming down and not saying anything? What’s the point in coming on and not saying anything?’</p>
      <p>A confused Jennifer then asked: ‘I’m sorry?’ to which Lorraine repeated her question: ‘What’s the point in you coming on the TV to clear the air and then you don’t say anything?’</p>
      <p>‘I believe I said a few things,’ Jennifer replied. ‘What was it that you were looking for that I didn’t say?’</p>

      <p>‘You didn’t answer any of the questions that were put to you and I don’t see the point in you coming on, to be honest,’ Lorraine then quipped.</p>
      <p>We weren’t expecting all this drama so early on in the morning!</p>

      <p>Jennifer then defended her answers to Piers and Susanna, and added: ‘I appreciate where you are coming from and I would love all the viewers to know that I am simply to make it very clear that there is no favouritism, I haven’t run off with your money, your prime minister is still your prime minister.</p>
      <p>‘I just happen to be quite upset that he’s [Boris] hiding his head in the sand.’</p>

      <p>Piers later laughed: ‘You really don’t want to wind up Lorraine Kelly on a Monday morning… That was Esther McVey level.’</p>
      <h3>Viewers praised Lorraine Kelly for her straight-talking</h3>

      <p>Viewers were doubled over in shock by Lorraine’s comments and rushed to Twitter to have their say, with one writing: ‘Yes @Lorraine! Some very welcome blunt and straight-talking! Saying what we all think.’</p>
      <p>Echoing a similar sentiment, another added: ‘Shots fired Lorraine! Totally agree. Answer the questions….’</p>
