      <h1>Allstars platform aims to connect brands, influencers</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T08:09:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 08:09</time> by <a rel="author">News Desk</a></address>
      <p>With social media permeating everyday life, influencers has become more familiar and accepted. Sometimes known as “internet celebrities”, they are often hired by brands to promote products on their accounts.</p>
      <p>However, some businesses may not be familiar with the details of the service, such as how to know which influencer is right for the brand or how to get in touch with them. There is also the notion that influencers cost big money, making small-scale businesses reluctant to use their services.</p>
      <p>Aiming to eliminate those problems, <a href="https://www.allstars.id/">Allstars </a>platform was launched in early November to connect influencers to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Indonesia. </p>
      <p>With 20,000 registered influencers on the platform, Allstars hopes to offer an easy solution for SMEs seeking the right influencers.</p>
      <p>The influencers are ranked into nano, micro, macro and top-tier based on their follower count. Under the nano category are those with less than 10,000 followers, while the top tiers have over 1 million.</p>

      <p>Operating on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter or YouTube, these influencers can be hired to promote brands of fashion, foods and beverages, beauty, parenting products and travel, among others.</p>
      <p>“Allstars is where influencers and brands meet. We understand that there’s a need from SMEs to raise their brand awareness and products,” said Alex Wijaya, business director of Allstars, in a press conference in Jakarta on Nov. 6. “We also present this platform to influencers who might not know how to find access and to encourage them to be more active in seeking offers,” he added.  </p>
      <p>On the website, influencers and brands can seek each other out. Brands are offered a list of influencers, with details that include follower numbers, location and fee.</p>
      <p>Likewise, influencers can look for campaigns from brands posted on the website and choose the ones they find suitable.</p>
      <p>“We established Allstars because we saw the demand. Brands have also acknowledged that influencers actually make an impact in raising awareness about their products,” said Alex. “With the platform, we encourage brands to seek the right influencers as they can make a great impact.” (wng)</p>
