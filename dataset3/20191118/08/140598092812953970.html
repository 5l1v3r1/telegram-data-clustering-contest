      <h3>Can I register as an overseas voter?</h3>
      <p>If you are a British citizen living abroad, you can apply to be an overseas voter.</p>
      <p>You must have been registered to vote in the UK<b> within the last 15 years</b> and be eligible to vote in UK Parliamentary general elections.</p>
      <p>If you were too young to register when you left the UK, you can still register as an overseas voter.</p>
      <p>You can do this if your parent or guardian was registered to vote in the UK, as long as you left the UK no more than 15 years ago.</p>
      <h3>Am I already registered to vote?</h3>
      <p>An overseas registration expires after 12 months. You must renew your registration each year, and will be reminded to do so by your local Electoral Registration office.</p>
      <h4>If you have renewed your registration</h4>
      <p>If you have renewed your registration and it will last until after Dec 12 2019, you are registered as an overseas voter. You do not need to register to vote again.</p>
      <h4>If your registration has expired</h4>
      <p>If your registration has expired, you will need to register to vote again.</p>
      <p>Register now at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/register-to-vote">gov.uk/register-to-vote</a>. You need to register by midnight on Nov 26.</p>
      <h3>Unsure about your registration status?</h3>
      <p>If you are not sure about anything to do with your registration status, please contact your local authority.</p>
      <p>You can find their contact details <a href="https://www.gov.uk/find-local-council">by entering your postcode here</a> for the UK address at which you are registered.</p>
      <p>You will be provided with contact details for your local authority.</p>
      <p>They will be able to help with any questions about your registration status.</p>
      <h3>How do I register to vote?</h3>
