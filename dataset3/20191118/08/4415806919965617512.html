      <p>LeBron James led the way once again as he scored 33 points to help the Los Angeles Lakers to a 122-101 win over the Atlanta Hawks.</p>
      <p>The Lakers have now made their best start to a season since 2010-11 and boast the best record in the NBA at 11-2.</p>
      <p>James fell just short of a triple-double, managing 12 rebounds and seven assists.</p>

      <p>Buddy Hield scored a season-high 35 points as the Sacramento Kings ended the Boston Celtics’ 10-game winning streak with a 100-99 victory at the Golden 1 Center.</p>
      <p>Two free throws from Richaun Holmes with 13 seconds remaining proved decisive for the Kings, who made it five wins in seven matches having lost their opening five games.</p>
      <p>The Denver Nuggets continued their impressive form on the road as Jamal Murray’s 39 points helped them to a 131-114 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies.</p>
