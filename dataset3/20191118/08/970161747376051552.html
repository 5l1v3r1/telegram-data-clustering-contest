      <p><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/cristiano-ronaldo/">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> says <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/juventus/">Juventus</a> boss <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/maurizio-sarri/">Maurizio Sarri</a> was right to substitute him in his last two appearances for the club and confirmed he has been carrying an injury.</p>
      <p>The Portuguese superstar was withdrawn after just 55 minutes in his last outing before the international break against AC Milan, while he was also taken off against Lokomotiv Moscow in the <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/champions-league/">Champions League</a> a few days earlier.</p>
      <p>He appeared furious at the time, not looking at his manager as he headed straight down the tunnel, while reports in Italy claim he had left the stadium before the game had even finished.</p>

      <p>Sarri defended his decision afterwards, revealing that Ronaldo has been struggling with an injury, and the 34-year-old says he understands why his manager subbed him off.</p>

      <p>Speaking to <i>A Bola</i> after Portugal’s 2-0 win over Luxembourg, he said: ‘In the last three weeks I have been limited.</p>
      <p>‘Everyone knows that I don’t like to be substituted, but there was no problem in my gestures after the change. I tried to help Juventus by playing injured.</p>
      <p>‘No-one likes to be replaced, but I understand it, because I wasn’t well in those two games. I wasn’t 100%.’</p>
      <p>Ronaldo had no such issues with the national team, scoring a hat-trick against Lithuania last week before netting his 99th goal for his country on Sunday – and he is now just one away from a century of international strikes.</p>

      <p>Speaking about Ronaldo’s injury, Sarri explained: ‘Over the last month, he has had this little knee problem, he had a knock in training and it hurt the collateral ligament.</p>
      <p>‘When he trains at high intensity or plays, it unbalances him, so he ends up overcompensating and it damages the calf and thigh muscles. It is affecting his performances and he is not at his best at the moment.’</p>
