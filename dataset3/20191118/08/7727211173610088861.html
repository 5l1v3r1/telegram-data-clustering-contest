      <p>A historical 120-year-old property - which was once a former school - has gone up for auction for a bargain price.</p>
      <p>The striking, detached red-brick property on <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/southport">Corporation Street, Southport</a> was opened in 1898 as Christ Church Higher Grade School.</p>
      <p>It also once housed the former Taskers sports store in the town centre and has been put up for auction with a guide price of £400,000.</p>

      <p>The 6,000 sq ft, two-storey building is subdivided into two units and has a large rooftop terrace that was once a playground.</p>
      <p>Pictures inside the building show mannequins that have been left behind when it was once the <a href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/all-about/southport">Taskers store</a> and a staircase surrounded by television screens has been left untouched.</p>
      <p>Other images show stunning stained glass windows still intact and large spacious rooms with original pillars .</p>
      <p>Paul Thompson, managing director of auction house Pugh, said: “This is a really well known Southport property and it would be really good news for for the town if it were given a new lease of life.</p>
