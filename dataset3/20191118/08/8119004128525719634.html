        <b>A leader of an outlawed group has died in a so-called shootout with police in Jhenaidah’s Harinakundu.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The incident took place in the Upazila’s Tetulia Mor area at 2am on Monday, according to Harinakundu Police Station OC Md Asaduzzaman.</p>
      <p>The dead man has been identified as 50-year-old Badsha Sheikh.</p>
      <p>He was a regional leader of Purbo Banglar Communist Party, said police. The man was implicated in nine cases, including seven cases of murder, with Harinakundu and Jhenaidah police stations.</p>
      <p>A police team raided Tetulia Mor’s Mehgoni Bagan after being tipped off about a group of ‘extremists’ holding a secret meeting in the area, said OC Asaduzzaman.</p>
      <p>“Sensing the presence of police, the extremists opened fire, forcing the law enforcers to retaliate. The miscreants fled the scene after about 10 minutes of gunfight. A bullet-ridden body was later found on the spot.”</p>
      <p>The body was taken to Harinakundu Upazila Health Complex where the on-duty doctor declared him dead, said the OC.</p>
      <p>Police have recovered a shutter gun, a bullet and two sharp weapons from the spot, he said.</p>
