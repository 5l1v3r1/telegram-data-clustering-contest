        <b>A safety car ending seemed on the cards for a while, but they were able to restart the <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/grandsprix/united-states-grand-prix">United States Grand Prix</a> to give us all an exceptional finish. <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/red-bull-racing">Aston Martin Red Bull Racing</a> were in a position to claim their first one-two since Malaysia 2016, but it didn't happen after a collision between <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lewis-hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a> and <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/alexander-albon">Alex Albon</a>. During the restart, the tensions between the driver and pit-wall were high. </b>
      </p>
      <p>Varying strategies made an interesting end. Albon was breathing down <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/max-verstappen">Max Verstappen's</a> neck but the Dutchman pulled away smoothly and bolted into the lead. Maybe the British-Thai driver was distracted by his engineer. Watch the incident below. </p>
