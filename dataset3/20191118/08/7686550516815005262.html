      <p>Kind-hearted restaurant staff paid customer's bill after she took her dying dog in for her last supper - a filet mignon.</p>
      <p>Elaine Potter took her 14-year-old Maltese terrier Phoebe in to her favourite restaurant for her last meal, before taking her to be put down.</p>
      <p>Former breeder Elaine, 50, decided to end her beloved pet's suffering on Monday, after the little dog battled cancer for eight months, but wanted to give her a day to remember first.</p>
      <p>After watching the Armistice Day memorial in bed and then a nice bath, the pair went for a walk along West Wittering beach.</p>
      <p>Elaine knew she had to end her suffering - but wanted to take her friend for one last meal first.</p>
      <p>Mum-of-two Elaine, of Selsey, West Sussex, said: "She had a cancerous lump and she was having trouble breathing when lying down and was sleeping all the time.</p>
      <p>"I knew it was time."</p>

      <p>She said: “I just thought it was fitting because her stomach was so bloated. I thought about a rotisserie chicken but then thought 'no, she deserves more'."</p>
      <p>The adorable dog "absolutely loved" her final meal, which she ate from a low table in front of a fire as Elaine cried uncontrollably.</p>
      <p>Elaine chose to take Phoebe to the Earl of March, a fine dining country pub in Chichester, West Sussex.</p>
      <p>She told staff about the tragic story and they pampered Phoebe with "lots of cuddles" before serving up the custom dish, on a silver platter.</p>
      <p>Elaine said: "I didn't want her eating off the floor like a dog - she was my baby.</p>
      <p>“I've been to the Earl of March before and they are absolutely fabulous so I went in and told them what was happening.</p>
      <p>"They made me feel so welcome and they didn't stop cuddling her."</p>
      <p>Elaine said she was so embarrassed during the meal because she “couldn’t stop crying.”</p>

      <p>But when she went to pay the bill, at the fine dining pub, in Chichester, West Sussex, kindly staff decided to pay for the £29 fillet steak themselves.</p>
      <p>Elaine added: “To have that, I couldn't believe it. It was so emotional.</p>
      <p>"They took so much care and cuddles and they took pictures of us. I'm so grateful to all the staff there and Suzanne Rich in particular. I just can't thank them enough.</p>
      <p>“It really was a fitting send off for my big baby.”</p>
      <p>Elaine, whose chronic hip pain leaves her virtually housebound, shares her bed with her many dogs and dresses them in a colourful array of pet clothes.</p>
      <p>She said: “All dog owners will say their pets are adorable, but Maltese are the most angelic loving breed.</p>
      <p>“They are so beautiful and know when you are hurting.</p>
      <p>“They lie around the small of my back and lick my tears when I’m in pain.</p>
      <p>"They are my pure white angels."</p>

      <p>Elaine described her 'woeful’ walk to the car before driving the “longest drive” of her life to have Phoebe put to sleep.</p>
      <p>Describing her dog’s final moments, the distraught owner said: “I put my face right up to hers. I was the last thing that she saw.</p>
      <p>“It was lovely, it really was.”</p>
      <p>Elaine was grateful to Phoebe's vet Jose Monreal from Vets4Pets, in Rustington, West Sussex.</p>
      <p>She said: "Jose was brilliant. He wrapped her in a pink blanket because he knows how much I love the colour.</p>
      <p>“When I brought her home she was still warm. All the other dogs came over to say goodbye.</p>
      <p>“They smelt her and nudged her. She looked so peaceful.”</p>
      <p>Phoebe was cremated on Wednesday morning alongside a squishy toy her son bought.</p>

      <p>She joined another of Elaine’s dogs in a handmade urn.</p>
      <p>Elaine plans to do the same with the other nine dogs - Coco, Rosie, Jack, Lily, Darcey, Rex, Sophie, Pucci and Lucie - and even wants to be buried alongside them herself.</p>
      <p>Elaine said: “I want to raise money to put a statue of Phoebe in my back garden.</p>
      <p>"It’s such a peaceful place and I would put it alongside my angels and buddhas.</p>
      <p>“When my other dogs die they will go with me in my coffin.”</p>
      <p>In memory of Phoebe, Elaine and her son will have the ashes made into ink and tattooed onto their backs in the shape of her paw.</p>
