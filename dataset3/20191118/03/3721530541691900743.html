      <p>Capcom will sell <i>Street Fighter 5: Champion Edition</i> for $29.99, but existing players can upgrade to that version of the game for $24.99. <i>Street Fighter 5: Champion Edition</i> will also include a new fighter, Gill from <i>Street Fighter 3</i>, who’s coming to the game this December.</p>
