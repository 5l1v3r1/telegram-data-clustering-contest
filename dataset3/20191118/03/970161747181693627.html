      <p>Watchmen gifted us with its fifth episode tonight and the series began to take a dramatic turn that we certainly weren’t expecting.</p>
      <p>The chapter, titled Little Fear Of Lightning, followed Tim Blake Nelson’s character Wade Tillman aka Looking Glass and his uncovering of the Senator’s involvement in the 7th Cavalry.</p>
      <p>On top of that, we also got a glimpse at Adrian Veidt’s past crime of accidentally killing 3million people and we finally learned what Will Reeves’ mysterious pills are for – hello nostalgia.</p>
      <p>But although we <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/17/watchmen-creator-damon-lindelof-fan-theories-easter-eggs-might-not-get-season-2-really-really-long-time-11170978/">got a whole load of answers about the series from showrunner Damon Lindelof himself</a>, we still have a number of questions about the episode at hand.</p>

      <h3>What are the 7th Cavalry planning with their portal and can they be stopped?</h3>
      <p>Looking Glass uncovered the 7th Cavalry’s base and found them working on a portal.</p>
      <p>He learned that the group has been building a data portation window in order to open the machine in Tulsa to carry out an attack on the city.</p>
      <p>But what exactly has the 7th Cavalry got planned and will the vigilantes be able to stop them in time?</p>
      <h3>Will Looking Glass tell Angela that the 7th Cavalry is out to get her?</h3>

      <p>Looking Glass was given a sick ultimatum by Senator Joe Keene Junior – who was revealed to be part of the 7th Cavalry – with either turning Sister Night into her superiors for knowing details about Judd’s murder, or risk having her and her family killed by the group.</p>
      <p>‘She either killed Judge Crawford or knows who did,’ the senator scorned. ‘Either way she threatened to disrupt the aforementioned peace. I know Agent Balke already suspects her, so how about you just help her along.’</p>
      <p>Before Looking Glass got Sister Night turned in, he told her what her grandad’s pills are for. We know also that Looking Glass was ultimately saving Sister Night from getting killed, so will he eventually tell her what’s going down with the 7th Cavalry and what he saw?</p>

      <h3>Will Sister Night return?</h3>

      <p>Sister Night was arrested after Agent Laurie Blake captured her confession thanks to Looking Glass’s wired cactus.</p>
      <p>Obviously, she’s still on a mission to work out whether or not her grandfather Will Reeves really did kill Judd Crawford, but now the whole team knows what she’s up to will she be able to continue?</p>
      <p>Will Laurie have her locked up for good for covering up the scene of the crime? We can’t see her getting away with this one…</p>
