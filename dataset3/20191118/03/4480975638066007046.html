      <h1>PBOC: China faces no conditions for continuous inflation, deflation</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T03:08:59+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 03:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/dhwani-mehta" target="_blank">Dhwani Mehta</a></address>
      <p>In its latest quarterly policy report published on Saturday, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) highlighted the following key points.</p>
      <blockquote>China has no conditions for continuous inflation or deflation as the government's macro policies are taking effect.<br/><br/>The domestic economy is facing downward pressure, and its endogenous growth momentum should be further enhanced.<br/><br/>PBOC will step up counter-cyclical adjustments while staying away from using a deluge of stimulus policies.<br/><br/>Efforts should be enhanced to prevent the spread of the expectations for inflation.</blockquote>
      <p>The headlines have little to no impact on the CNY markets, as USD/CNY trades on the front foot near 7.0110 despite a stronger Yuan setting by the PBOC.</p>
