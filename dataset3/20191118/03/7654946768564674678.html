      <h1>Yankees’ pitching coach Matt Blake gets Shane Bieber endorsement</h1>

      <p>Shane Bieber’s breakout 2019 season was due in part to him using his curveball more — a pitch that he improved throughout the year.</p>
      <p>The Indians’ right-hander credited <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/09/yankees-new-pitching-coach-matt-blake-ahead-of-his-time/">the Yankees’ new pitching coach, Matt Blake</a>, with the change.</p>
      <p>“He was an integral part in me using my curveball more,’’ the All-Star said by phone on Sunday of Blake, who spent the past four seasons with the Indians — including three as the assistant director of player development.</p>
      <p>“Matt had a lot of ideas of how to add that to my repertoire and the pitch had a lot to do with the success I had last year,’’ Bieber said. “He worked with me on when to throw it, how to get more spin on it and what counts it was most effective.’’</p>
      <p>It was Blake’s ability to help develop Bieber and some of Cleveland’s other young arms that made the 34-year-old stand out.</p>
      <p>Bieber’s ties to Blake go back to 2015, when Bieber was still at UC Santa Barbara, pitching for the Yarmouth-Dennis Red Sox in the Cape Cod summer league, with Blake as the pitching coach.</p>
      <p>Though Bieber spent only a few weeks with the team, the connection paid off when he was drafted in the fourth round by the Indians, just as Blake was joining the organization.</p>
      <p>“It was pretty random, but to have someone like Matt at that stage and then throughout the minors really helped,’’ said Bieber, 24, who finished fourth in the AL Cy Young Award vote in his first full season in the majors.</p>
      <p>And while some attention has been paid to the fact that Blake doesn’t have much experience with being a pitching coach for a team, Bieber is confident that won’t be an issue.</p>
      <p>“He has extensive pitching knowledge, but he also has an ability to get along with everybody,’’ Bieber said. “He’s a player-first-type coach.” In this world, with the way the game is going and it’s more about analytics, you can lose a little of that personal touch. But he gets it.”</p>
      <p>And it’s why Bieber was sorry to see him leave the Indians.</p>
      <p>“Selfishly, I wish we could have held on to him longer,’’ Bieber said. “He’s the perfect blend of old school and new school. He’s got a mind that’s perfect for the game right now. With all the information available, you can get a little lost. He’s able to relay those messages without it being confusing.”</p>
      <p>That’s what Blake did with Bieber and his curveball.</p>
      <p>“He understands what he sees on a computer and what he sees on a field,’’ Bieber said. “I think he’ll be great with this role. Mound visits, in-game adjustments, he’ll be able to deal with all of it, even if he hasn’t done it much before.’’</p>
