        <figcaption>Remembering Sridevi at the awards ceremony, Nagarjuna said, "I worked with Sridevi in four films. My first film with her was Akhari Poratam. She carried an aura into the set. She was the goddess of grace. Everyone says that the beauty and talent she possessed were God's gift. But I say that Boney Kapoor was a real gift to her. I knew both of them for a long time. While Himmatwala made her a star in Bollywood, it is Mr. India produced by Boney Kapoor that made her a national superstar. ANR garu and Sridevi garu live on as long as cinema is alive."</figcaption>

        <figcaption>Chiranjeevi also remembered Sridevi at the event. He said, "I worked in 3-4 films with Sridevi. Even during the shoot, she used to talk about cinema. She was completely dedicated to cinema. It's very sad that she left us very early. She acted in almost all Indian languages and became The Lady Superstar of India. I am very happy that this award is giving an opportunity to once again remember her on this stage."</figcaption>
