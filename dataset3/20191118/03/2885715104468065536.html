      <p>Frozen 2 will hit Indian screens on November 22, but before watching the sequel, it is time to revisit the original animated film that released in 2013.</p>
      <p>Jennifer Lee and Chris Buck directorial Frozen was about a princess, of a fictional kingdom Arendelle (modelled over a medieval Scandinavia kingdom), who sets out to search for her missing sister with an iceman, his reindeer and a sentient snowman.</p>
      <p>The sister won’t be easy to find, though. For one, she does not wish to be found. Secondly, she has powers to manipulate ice and snow, can build complex structures with it and also destroy her enemies.</p>

      <p>The film’s visual style is similar to Pixar and yet markedly different. Pixar is a studio owned by Disney but not every Disney animated film is made by Pixar. While Frozen, like any modern 3D animated film, owes its existence to Pixar, it also involves hand-drawn animation to give it a unique feel.</p>
      <p>The film is a musical and features a couple of earworms. The plot and characters are interesting, and the story moves at a fast pace. Elsa loses control of her powers on her coronation day and escapes to the North Mountain. The town of Arendelle is enveloped by a thick sheet of snow and a permanent winter.</p>
      <p>She builds a home for herself there and sings about emancipation and freedom (“Let it go” sung by Idina Menzel). Her younger sister Anna catches up to her but is injured grievously when she tries to bring her sister back. The trolls, portrayed as wise beings in the film, say only true love’s kiss can cure her.</p>

      <p>The script turns the True Love’s Kiss trope on its head, and it is her sister Elsa’s embrace that saves her.</p>
      <p>Elsa realises that love is the key to control her wild magic. She ends the winter and assumes control of the kingdom as the queen.</p>
      <p>Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel, Jonathan Groff, Josh Gad, and Santino Fontana lend their voices to different characters in Frozen.</p>
