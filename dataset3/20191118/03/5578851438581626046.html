        <b>Afghanistan’s national cricket team beat West Indies in the 3rd Twenty20 international on Sunday to clinch the series.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The final match was held at Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow, India—where Afghanistan teenage opener Rahmanullah Gurbaz hit an attacking half-century to set up Afghanistan's 29-run series-clinching win over the West Indies in the third and last T20I match on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Gurbaz hit 79 off 52 balls as Afghanistan posted 156 for eight, a total their bowlers defended by restricting the West Indies team to 127/7.</p>
      <p>Afghanistan 156 for 8 (Gurbaz 79, Asghar 24, Paul 2-26) beat West Indies 127 for 7 (Hope 52, Lewis 24, Naveen 3-24) by 29 runs.</p>
      <p>Afghanistan won the series 2-1 after losing the opening game. Previously, West Indies beat Afghanistan 3-0 in three one-day games before the T20 series.</p>
      <p>Afghanistan’s paceman Naveen-ul-Haq took three wickets to obstruct the West Indies' chase despite a valiant 52 by wicketkeeper-batsman Shai Hope.</p>
      <p>Gurbaz was named man of the match. He smashed six fours and five sixes for his team before falling to West Indies captain Kieron Pollard.</p>
      <p>The two teams will next play a one-off Test starting November 27.</p>
