      <p><b><a href="https://www.allkpop.com/artisttag/iu">IU</a></b> has finally met up with her other half from "<b>YOU &amp; I</b>".</p>
      <p>In "YOU &amp; I", she asked the boy to wait for her in the future, and to call her name when she finally got there. IU finally reached the future in "<b>above the time</b>", and <b>Lee Hyun Woo </b>was right there waiting for her. IU's "above the time" is the sequel to her 2011 song "YOU &amp; I". IU mentioned that she started working on “Outside the Time” in 2018, while thinking of the date that appeared at the end of the "YOU &amp; I" music video (December 31, 2019).</p>
