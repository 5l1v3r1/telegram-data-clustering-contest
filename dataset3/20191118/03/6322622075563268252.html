      <p>(Nov 18): Thailand’s economy grew slower than expected in the third quarter and the government lowered its forecast for full-year growth as the country deals with the impact of the U.S.-China trade war and a strong currency.</p>
      <p>Gross domestic product rose 2.4% from a year ago, the National Economic and Social Development Council said Monday, below the median estimate of 2.7% in a Bloomberg survey of economists. The council cut its 2019 GDP forecast to 2.6% -- from an earlier view of 2.7%-3.2% -- and said the economy should expand 2.7%-3.7% next year.</p>
      <p>Thailand’s trade-reliant economy has been hit by slumping exports, a surging currency and mixed performance in the tourism sector. The central bank earlier this month cut its benchmark interest rate to a record low and announced measures to slow gains in the baht, which has been the strongest performer in emerging markets, rising more than 9% over the past year.</p>
      <p>The baht was at 30.262 per dollar after the data release, little changed from beforehand.</p>
      <p>The NESDC said exports now are expected to shrink by 2% this year, compared to the 1.2% contraction it forecast in August. Growth should pick up in the final quarter of the year and accelerate into 2020, driven by government stimulus measures and a gradual recovery in exports, the council said. - Bloomberg</p>
