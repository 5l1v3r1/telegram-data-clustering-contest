      <h1>Chehre: Kriti Kharbanda Shown The Door By Makers Of The Amitabh Bachchan Starrer Due To Her Starry Tantrums?</h1>

      <p>Kriti Kharbanda had a great year as her multi-starrer film Housefull 3 made massive amounts at the box-office. Though a multi-starrer, the film went on to be one of the biggest hits of this year leaving every star happy. Now, she is looking forward to Pagalpanti which is also a multi-starrer. Next, she had Chehre on the cards. We say 'had' because reportedly, she is no more a part of this project that stars Amitabh Bachchan and Emraan Hashmi. Blame it on her starry tantrums.</p>
      <p>A report in Pinkvilla suggests that Kriti who has already shot the first schedule of the film was asked to exit the project due to her starry tantrums. Reportedly, Kriti was throwing tantrums and though makers tried to make changes and adjustments to suit her, things just did not pan out well. Further, the report also suggests that she had an argument of sorts with the director of the film. Makers then decided to go ahead with the project without her. There was a mismanagement of dates too by Kriti Kharbanda's team that led to her exit from the film. A source has revealed to the portal, "Kriti's tantrums and her team's mismanagement of time and dates were becoming a regular nuisance at work. They were trying to adjust to her demands but had to finally give in."</p>

      <p>Now, as she was a part of the first schedule of the film, a few scenes would be re-shot along with the new actress. Chehre directed by Rumi Jafry is slated to release on April 24, 2020. Emraan Hashmi had recently shared the poster of the film which announcing the release date. It featured Emraan and Amitabh Bachchan pulling off an intense look.
