      <p>LG Electronics has deployed its Cloi robots to Seoul National University Hospital as a trial to improve medical care, the company has announced. <br/><br/>The South Korean electronics maker deployed 25 robots to the hospital's children's centre. <br/><br/>The robots will be placed at various places, including in intensive care units and operating rooms, as part of a three-month trial. <br/><br/>The goal is to provide emotional support for children that may fear the different environment and lack of freedom to move around. <br/><br/>LG Cloi has a 5-inch LCD screen and has <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/lg-naver-team-up-for-thinq-hub-ai-speaker/">Naver's artificial intelligence platform Clova</a> installed. It will also come with 900 pieces of child-oriented content from 70 publishers, such as music, games, and audiobooks. <br/><br/>Besides caring for the children, LG and the hospital will co-develop services that will see the robots used for video chats between staff, translation services for foreign patients, and provide video guidelines for parents before procedures.  <br/><br/>The company said it hoped the robots will become caregivers and friends for the children. <br/><br/>LG and Seoul National University Hospital will continue to collaborate on applying robotics at hospitals after the trial, they said. <br/><br/>The South Korean electronics maker is also collaborating with CJ Foodville <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/lg-to-develop-robots-for-restaurants/">to apply robotics to restaurants</a>.</p>
