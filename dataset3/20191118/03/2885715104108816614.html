      <p>Strong, gusty winds coupled with a clear sky and ample sunlight further improved the city’s air quality to the ‘poor’ category Sunday from ‘very poor’ a day earlier. IMD officials said winds as strong as 36 km/hr were recorded in the city Sunday, which dispersed pollutants.</p>
      <p>Sunlight also helped increase the atmospheric mixing layer height which further helped release pollutants trapped closer to the surface, IMD officials said.</p>
      <p>The 24-hour AQI of Delhi Sunday was 215 (poor). Gurgaon had the lowest AQI of 136 (moderate), Ghaziabad recorded 218 and Noida 203.</p>
      <p>A report from the central government’s air quality monitoring system SAFAR said, “High surface winds are forecast to continue for the next 24 hours after which they are likely to decrease slowly.”</p>
      <p>Share of stubble burning in Delhi’s air Sunday, as per the SAFAR report, was 2% and is expected to go up to 9% Monday. Air quality is expected to remain ‘poor’ or improve to ‘moderate’ Monday, but may deteriorate from Tuesday and reach the higher end of ‘very poor’ by Wednesday, as per the report.</p>
