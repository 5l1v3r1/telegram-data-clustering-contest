      <p>Nigeria's in-form forward Victor Osimhen struck twice as they came from a goal down to beat minnows Lesotho 4-2 in their 2021 Africa Cup of Nations Group L qualifier in Maseru on Sunday.</p>
      <p>JOHANNESBURG: Nigeria's in-form forward Victor Osimhen struck twice as they came from a goal down to beat minnows Lesotho 4-2 in their 2021 Africa Cup of Nations Group L qualifier in Maseru on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The west Africans fell behind to an early strike from Masoabi Nkoto, but led by the break as Alex Iwobi equalised and Samuel Chukwueze put them in front.</p>

      <p>Osimhen had looked the most dangerous player on the pitch and was rewarded with a second-half brace as Nigeria claimed a full haul of six points from their opening two qualifiers. Lesotho’s second came via a Chidozie Awaziem own goal.</p>
      <p>Senegal's Bristol City striker Famara Diedhiou struck a nine-minute hat-trick in the second half of their 4-1 Group I away victory over Eswatini, formerly Swaziland, as the 2019 runners-up also sealed maximum points from two games.</p>
      <p>Diedhiou missed a first-half penalty as the teams went into the break goalless, with Liverpool forward Sadio Mane withdrawn at halftime by coach Aliou Cisse.</p>
      <p>After Diedhiou’s heroics, home midfielder Fanelo Mamba scored and was then sent off, before Badou Ndiaye grabbed a fourth for the visitors with 15 minutes remaining.</p>
      <p>Congo's Prince Ibarra opened the scoring as they beat Guinea-Bissau 3-0 in the other game in the pool, with Junior Makiesse and Silvere Ganvoula also on target.</p>
      <p>South Africa edged Sudan 1-0 in their Group C game Johannesburg to get their first win of the qualifiers thanks to a goal just before the break from midfielder Lebogang Phiri.</p>
      <p>Burkina Faso's experienced forward Aristide Bance netted twice as they beat South Sudan 2-1 in Group B but Uganda moved to the top of the pool with a 2-0 home win over Malawi as Emmanuel Okwi and Fahad Bayo were on target.</p>
      <p>In Group A, Mali midfielder Moussa Djenepo and Mohamed Camara netted first-half goals in a 2-0 win away to Chad, while Guinea's Issiaga Sylla and Jose Kante were on target in a 2-0 home victory over Namibia.</p>
      <p>Benin claimed a 1-0 win against Sierra Leone in Group L thanks to a first half goal from Jodel Dossou.</p>
      <p>Cameroon needed a second half strike by Ngoumo Ngamaleu to secure a 1-0 win versus Rwanda in Group F.</p>
      <p>There are 13 more qualifiers on Monday and Tuesday, before the competition takes a nine-month break until August 2020.</p>
