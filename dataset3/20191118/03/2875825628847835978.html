      <h1>Eric Abidal explains where Barcelona stand on Neymar transfer return</h1>
      <h2>The Spanish champions attempted to re-sign the Brazilian during the summer</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T03:17:42+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 03:17</time> by <a rel="author">Irishmirror.ie</a></address>
      <p>Barcelona sporting director Eric Abidal has insisted that re-signing Neymar will "always be an option" for the La Liga club.</p>
      <p>The Catalan club attempted to bring the Brazil international back to the Camp Nou during the summer - two-years after he joined Paris Saint-Germain for a world-record transfer fee of Â£200million.</p>
      <p>Although PSG were believed to be open to selling the 27-year-old, the two clubs were unable to come to an agreement and the forward remained with the French champions.</p>
      <p>However, several reports in Spain have suggested that <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> will look to resume negotiations next summer, and Abidal has not ruled out the possibility of Neymar rejoining the club in the future.</p>

      <p>"A top player, who has a Barca philosophy and who is performing at a high level, will always be an option," Abidal told <a href="https://www.mundodeportivo.com/futbol/fc-barcelona/20191117/471667601804/abidal-neymar-barca-fichaje-refuerzo-entrevista-md.html">Mundo Deportivo</a> when asked about the Brazilian.</p>
      <p>"From there, at the sports level we can make decisions, but the whole financial issue, there are things that you can reach and others that you cannot.</p>
      <p>"The future will say. If it continues at this level, because the season is very long, I will not say that it will be option number 1 but it can be a clear option."</p>
      <p>Neymar's future with PSG became one of the biggest talking points of the summer transfer window, with the Brazilian believed to be keen to leave the Ligue 1 champions.</p>

      <p>Although <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> were also understood to be interested in the 27-year-old, it was widely reported that he favoured a return to Barcelona, where he played for four seasons.</p>
      <p>The Catalan club tried their best to prise the forward away, reportedly offering up a player-plus-cash deal, but ultimately failed to meet the French giants' valuation of the star.</p>
      <p>Following the close of the transfer window and his return to Thomas Tuchel's team, Neymar was booed by PSG fans but he has worked hard to regain their support, scoring four goals in five games this season.</p>
      <p>However, he has struggled to stay fit and has not played since sustaining an injury while on international duty with Brazil last month.</p>
