      <h1>Devine: No honor in Prince Andrew’s self-pity over Epstein friendship</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T03:02:59+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 03:02</time> by <a rel="author">Miranda Devine</a></address>
      <p>Not once in his car crash of an <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/16/prince-andrew-says-he-couldnt-sweat-in-attempt-to-debunk-epstein-accusers-claim/">interview with the BBC</a> did Prince Andrew express any sympathy for the victims of his friend Jeffrey Epstein.</p>
      <p>Not once did he express remorse for his 11-year friendship with the late pedophile predator.</p>
      <p>His only failing <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/16/prince-andrew-i-stayed-friends-with-jeffrey-epstein-because-he-was-too-honorable/">is being “too honorable.”</a></p>
      <p>The queen’s favorite son was unconvincing when he denied claims that he had sex with Epstein’s then-17-year-old sex slave, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, three times: in London in 2001, in New York and in an orgy on Epstein’s private Caribbean island.</p>
      <p>“I have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever.”</p>
      <p>“How do you explain the photograph,” BBC reporter Emily Maitlis then asked, referring to the notorious snapshot taken of Andrew with his arm around the bare midriff of an obviously underage Giuffre, while his friend and Epstein’s alleged “madam” Ghislaine Maxwell looks on with a smile.</p>
      <p>“I can’t,” said the prince, who proceeded to imply that the photo was a fake, a ruse his friends had anonymously been backgrounding to the media.</p>
      <p>It couldn’t be real because he’d never been upstairs in Maxwell’s London home, he doesn’t go out without a jacket and tie in London and <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/17/prince-andrew-claims-photo-with-epstein-sex-slave-is-fake-because-he-doesnt-hug/">he doesn’t do public displays of affection</a> because he’s royal.</p>
      <p>“I don’t remember that photograph ever being taken … it’s me, but whether that’s my hand …”</p>
      <p>In an interview with the FBI in 2011, in court statements in a defamation suit against Maxwell in 2015, and various media interviews, Giuffre has described in great and consistent detail the night in London when that photograph was taken. She alleges she danced with Andrew in Tramp nightclub and later had sex with him in Maxwell’s Belgravia home in London, which began with him licking her feet in the bath and ended with “the longest 10 minutes of my life.”</p>
      <p>She later was paid $15,000 by Epstein for her efforts and was congratulated by Maxwell for making Andrew happy, she said. She recalled thinking at the time that she was only four years older than Andrew’s elder daughter, Beatrice.</p>
      <p>Asked by the BBC if he felt any “guilt, regret or shame” about his relationship with Epstein, Andrew said only that “it was the wrong decision to go and see him in 2010.”</p>
      <p>That is the only mistake he would admit to: meeting Epstein in New York after the disgraced financier had been convicted and jailed briefly in a questionable plea bargain for “solicitation of prostitution involving a minor.”</p>
      <p>There is a photograph of Andrew and Epstein taken with a long lens in Central Park at the time, which the prince claimed was when he told Epstein <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/06/prince-andrew-claims-2010-jeffrey-epstein-visit-in-nyc-was-to-end-friendship/">he’d have to break off the friendship</a>.</p>
      <p>“I admit fully that my judgment was probably colored by my tendency to be too honorable but that’s just the way it is.”</p>
      <p>Under questioning, he admitted he didn’t just walk in the park. He stayed with Epstein at his Upper East Side mansion for several days because it was “convenient,” during which time he was guest of honor at a dinner, to which Woody Allen reportedly also was invited, and which was a crucial part of Epstein’s reputational rehabilitation.</p>
      <p>“Do I regret the fact he has quite obviously conducted himself in a manner unbecoming? Yes,” the prince said of Epstein.</p>
      <p>“Unbecoming?” interrupted Maitlis. “He was a sex offender.”</p>
      <p>“I’m sorry,” replied Andrew. “I’m being polite. I mean in the sense that he was a sex offender.”</p>
      <p>Just that trifling sense.</p>
      <p>No, Andrew had no regrets about the friendship, which saw him visit Epstein in his homes in New York, Palm Beach and his private island, and invite him to Sandringham Estate and events at Windsor Castle.</p>
      <p>“As far as my association with him was concerned, it had some seriously beneficial outcomes.”</p>
      <p>It was a loathsomely self-pitying performance, which has been branded a p.r. disaster for the royals.</p>
      <p>The prince proved only that he has no shame. It’s not just because his denials are hollow, and contradicted by photographic evidence and allegations by Roberts, and a second woman, Johanna Sjoberg.</p>
      <p>It’s also because, in all the preparation for the interview, in all the years of finding alibis, he can’t have considered the pain Epstein inflicted over many years on dozens of lost girls, as young as 14, recruited for his sexual pleasure and pimped out to his rich and powerful friends.</p>
      <p>Andrew should have been in a Manhattan courtroom in August and seen the human toll of Epstein and pals’ predatory behavior as 23 women who were victims told their stories.</p>
      <p>It was just two weeks after Epstein, 66, died in his jail cell from what the New York City medical examiner declared was a suicide.</p>
      <p>These brave young women or their lawyers spoke one after the other of stolen childhoods and a lifetime of self-loathing and suicide attempts.</p>
      <p>The striking similarity between all the accounts was how powerless these girls were made to feel because Epstein flaunted his relationships with rich and powerful pillars of the establishment. Men such as Prince Andrew.</p>
      <h3>Back-stab Bolton</h3>
      <p>No wonder John Bolton was fired as President Trump’s national security adviser. Testimony from the impeachment hearings keeps piling up to suggest that he was stirring trouble all along, fomenting unrest in the diplomatic corps and <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/10/30/house-wants-john-bolton-to-testify-for-impeachment-inquiry-report/">actively working to undermine</a> the president’s wishes. It was the same MO he used to undermine Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice when he was the hawkish UN ambassador under President George W. Bush. As Trump said, Bolton had to go or “we’d be in four wars now.” That’s not what America voted for in 2016.</p>
      <h3>Barr will bare truth</h3>
      <p><a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/16/barr-accuses-liberal-resistance-of-trying-to-sabotage-trump/">Attorney General William Barr delivered another brilliant speech</a> last week in which he railed against “The Resistance [who] essentially see themselves as engaged in a war to cripple, by any means necessary, a duly elected government.”</p>
      <p>The specifics will soon be apparent when the Justice Department inspector general’s report into abuse of the FISA court is released, followed by US Attorney John Durham’s criminal investigation into the origins of the FBI’s Trump-Russia probe.</p>
      <h3>Poor 2020 vision</h3>
      <p>Devin Nunes arranged for an inconvenient quotation from Democrat Rep. Al Green to be blown up into a poster and placed behind Nunes at last week’s impeachment hearings: “I’m concerned if we don’t impeach this president, he will get re-elected.”</p>
      <p>Democrats decried the poster as a lame stunt, but Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez repeated Green’s sentiment Wednesday on CNN. Impeachment, she said, is “about preventing a potentially disastrous outcome from occurring next year.” Everyone knows that’s dirty pool.</p>
