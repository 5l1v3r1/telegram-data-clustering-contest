      <p>
        <b>Design</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Netgear R6260 Router delivers a contemporary design with its sleek and minimalistic aesthetic. The unit measures in at 9.3 inches wide and 2.2 inches high, it will look perfectly at home in most modern homes of today.</p>
      <p>At the back of the unit lies all the ports and buttons. You get four Gigabit ports and one 2.0 USB port. All of which are neatly positioned at the back. The two antennas are attached to both sides of the back end of the unit with most of the front having a clean and smooth layout with four LED lights in clear view at all times.</p>
      <p>The power button is placed right in between the reset and power adapter port. Overall, the whole outline of the back of the unit provides a rudimentary router design. Simple and to the point. Overall, the design of the Netgear R6260 is more conservative and leans towards a more minimalistic approach. Of course, the look of the router is not a huge factor to consider; it is all about its performance and the speed it can deliver to all connected devices.</p>
      <p>With that, let us take an in-depth look at what the<a href="https://www.mybestwirelessrouters.com/netgear-ac1600-review/"> Netgear AC1600 R6260 router</a> can provide in regards to performance and the features that come with it.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Setup</b>
      </p>
      <p>Installation of this router is a pretty simple process, as expected from the brand. The user-friendly qualities of Netgear routers are present and accounted for in the R6260 model. The instruction manual that comes with the unit is in-depth. It is written in a manner that even beginners can follow each step without any issues.</p>
      <p>To further streamline the installation process, the R6260 also comes with the Netgear app, Netgear Genie. This application provides convenience in tinkering with the router’s features. Netgear Genie is compatible with Android, PC, iOS, and MAC which means you can also install it into your smartphone to access your router’s settings at any time.</p>
      <p>Netgear Genie offers users full control with their router. You can use the default configurations, which provides optimized performance right out of the gate. But having the ability to customize the router is always a welcome option.</p>
      <p>All in all, setting up the R6260 is quite similar to all the other Netgear routers in the market. It is incredibly easy and can be done in a jiffy. It also offers legroom and more flexibility for those who want to manually adjust their router’s settings to enhance its performance further to suit their needs.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Functionalities and Features</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Netgear R6260 is marketed as being able to provide up to 3x faster speeds than other 802.11n routers. It utilizes dual-band Wi-Fi to provide users with up to a maximum of around 1,600MBps rates. This will also prevent lags as dual bands can avoid signal interference far better. The Netgear R6260 can be used for HD streaming and online multiplayer gaming as well, thanks to its solid 880MHz processor performance rating.</p>
      <p>The R6260 is also backwards compatible with devices that utilize 802.11 a/b/g/n protocols. While it can reach speeds of up to 300+1300MBps, this will vary with each case as this test was conducted incorporating optimum placement and setup.</p>
      <p>For online gaming, I highly recommend using a wired connection to one of its Gigabit ports to ensure optimum performance. As for the range, the R6260 provides a substantial wireless distance given that you don’t have several concrete/steel walls within your homes.</p>
      <p>This Netgear router also supports advanced QoS to help you prioritize specific devices. This is a must-have feature if you stream HD online or into online multiplayer games as you can set your primary device at the top of the priority list.</p>
      <p>Another noteworthy feature that will improve convenience is the ReadyShare software that comes pre-installed with the Netgear R6260 router. This software allows for important files to be shared between devices within your network.</p>
      <p>ReadyShare also includes a Vault that acts as a backup for vital data and other important files such as pictures. Another excellent sharing feature is the DLNA which allows you to watch your media collection on other wireless devices in your residence.</p>
      <p>Netgear routers also provide reliable security which the R6260 continues. The router offers users to personalize URL or create new FTP servers. Security protocols, such as WPA and WPA2, are also in place. For those who regularly have guests visiting, you can utilize the Guest network access, which allows them to connect to your Wi-Fi but not your primary network.</p>
      <p>Also, Netgear sports a super parental control that allows you to set bandwidth and time allowances to specific devices. You can also apply a filter that blocks inappropriate content from being accessed by specific connected devices to your network.</p>
