      <h1>Nikkei rises in cautious mood; Z Holdings, Line gain after merger</h1>

      <p>TOKYO — Japan’s Nikkei edged higher on cautious optimism, underpinned by gains on Wall Street and prospects of a Sino-U.S. trade deal, while Z Holdings and Line Corp advanced after a formal merger announcement.</p>
      <p>The Nikkei share average rose 0.3% to 23,366.79 by the midday break on Monday, and the broader Topix stood flat at 1,697.06.</p>
      <p>On Friday, Wall Street’s main stock indexes closed at record levels, fueled by fresh optimism over a potential easing of U.S.-China trade tensions and by big gains in shares of healthcare companies.</p>
      <p>Chinese state media Xinhua said on Sunday that China and the United States had “constructive talks” on trade in a high-level phone call on Saturday, without giving details.</p>
      <p>The benchmark Nikkei was flat in early trade but rose slightly after Hong Kong stocks opened firmer, later climbing more than 1%, despite clashes between anti-government protesters and police on the island, traders said.</p>
      <p>Hong Kong police on Monday trapped hundreds of protesters inside a major university and demonstrators rampaged through a tourist district, after almost two straight days of standoffs that have raised fears of a bloody showdown.</p>
      <p>In Tokyo, Z Holdings, formerly known as Yahoo Japan, and Line Corp climbed 1.9% and 1.8%, respectively, after the two sides formally annouced a merger plan shortly before the market open to create a $30 billion tech giant.</p>
      <p>SoftBank Corp’s internet unit Z Holdings was the fifth-most traded stocks on the main board, while the messaging app firm Line became the seventh-most traded.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, semiconductor-related shares fared well as Applied Materials soared 8% on Friday after the chip gear maker forecast first-quarter revenue and profit above Wall Street estimates.</p>
