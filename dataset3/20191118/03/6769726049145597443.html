      <p><i>ROCK of Ages</i> is bringing the ’80s back in a musical expected to get the audience dancing in the aisle at Wanneroo’s Limelight Theatre.</p>
      <p>Written by Chris D’Arienzo and directed by Ashlee Torrens and Kathleen Del Casale, the LA love story is set in a rock club in 1987 where big hair meets big dreams in a rock’n’roll comedy romance.</p>
      <p>A small-town girl, fresh off the bus and hoping to become a Hollywood star, meets a big-city dreamer who, while currently a busboy, is an aspiring rocker, and they fall in love to the greatest songs of the ’80s.</p>
      <p><i>Rock of Ages</i> is a jukebox musical using classic songs from the era by iconic rockers such as Foreigner, Journey, Bon Jovi, REO Speedwagon, Poison, Starship, Pat Benatar, Whitesnake, Europe and Twisted Sister.</p>
      <p>Nominated for five Tony Awards, including best musical, in 2009, the original Broadway production ran for 2328 performances over six years and was tied as the 29th-longest running show in Broadway history.</p>

      <p>The decision to direct <i>Rock of Ages</i> stems from Torrens’ long-time connection with the energetic musical – and Del Casale was eager to join her for the roller coaster ride.</p>
      <p>“It’s the sort of musical that will have you dancing in the aisle,” Del Casale said.</p>
      <p>“The show is a bawdy good time for anyone looking to forget their troubles and have some fun at the theatre.”</p>
      <p>Torrens said there was “something about the magic of ’80s music that makes you want to party”.</p>
      <p>“<i>Rock of Ages</i> is a big, brash, energetic tribute to classic rock, over-the-top ballads and fierce guitar,” she said.</p>

      <p>Del Casale and Torrens have been involved in theatre for a combined 20 years, first meeting at Limelight Theatre seven years ago when they were cast in the musical Hairspray.</p>
      <p>Since then, they have been in almost every musical staged at the theatre.</p>
      <p>“We’re excited to be directing and being at the forefront for once,” Del Casale said.</p>
      <p>“If you’ve only seen the movie, you’re likely to be surprised how fun, playful and interactive <i>Rock of Ages</i> on stage is.</p>
      <p>“The musical has its own brand and has lots of different songs that weren’t in the movie.”</p>

      <p>Torrens said they wanted to do the Broadway show justice.</p>
      <p>“It’s a very fast-paced and intricate show, with overlapping elements and scenes,” she said.</p>
      <p>“We want to make sure the audience are on their feet by the final bow and rockin’ all the way home.”</p>
