      <p><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/nsw-qld-bushfires-catastrophic-2019-11">Bushfires have devastated parts of Queensland and New South Wales</a>, but many individuals and companies are pitching in to help.</p>
      <p>On Monday, the New South Wales Rural Fire Service said in a tweet that 48 bush or grass bushfires were burning, adding that “heatwave conditions are developing across large parts of the state, so fire dangers will increase”.</p>

      <p>In Queensland, the Bureau of Meteorology highlighted that while fire dangers “have eased” since Sunday, there are many ongoing fires, with smoke even reaching out to New Zealand.</p>

      <p>Amid the bushfires, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/gofundme-bushfires-australia-2019-11">several fundraising campaigns have been created to support victims and animals – more than 200 listed on GoFundMe alone</a>.</p>
      <p>We took a look at what some Australian businesses are doing to help:</p>
      <h3>The Coffee Club</h3>
      <p>The Coffee Club will donate 50 cents from every hot coffee purchased on Wednesday November 20 to fundraise for BlazeAid, a non-profit organisation that supports local communities affected by natural disasters. The organisation helps rebuild fences and other structures that get damaged during events like bushfires.</p>
      <p>BlazeAid’s Debbie Buttler said the impact of fence destruction is often underestimated by those who aren’t familiar with the rural lifestyle. “Damaged or destroyed fences are devastating for farmers,” she said in a statement. “It’s a problem that causes many more problems, especially surrounding the management and containment of livestock. Often the costs to rebuild fencing is not covered by insurance.”</p>
      <h3>Bunnings</h3>
      <p>Bunnings is holding sausage sizzles around the country on Friday November 22 to help those affected by the bushfires. The home and hardware store is partnering with GIVIT, an organisation that works with charities to ensure that support reaches where it’s needed most. All the funds raised from the sausage sizzles will go into buying essential items people need.</p>
      <h3>Woolworths</h3>
      <p>Last week, <a href="https://www.woolworthsgroup.com.au/page/media/Latest_News/woolworths-pledges-half-a-million-to-salvos-bushfire-support-efforts/">Woolworths announced it is donating $500,000</a> to the Support Through Australian Natural Disasters (STAND) program which will go to the Salvation Army’s disaster appeal. The Salvation Army aims to raise $3 million to aid bushfire evacuees and the ongoing recovery efforts needed after the fires.</p>
      <h3>Australia Post</h3>
      <p><a href="https://newsroom.auspost.com.au/article/australia-post-assist-australian-red-cross-to-help-bushfire-affected-communities">Australia Post stores are accepting donations for the Red Cross Disaster Relief Recovery Fund</a> to help those affected by bushfires. All the donations will be used for first aid, work at evacuation centres and for helping people get in touch with their loved ones.</p>
      <h3>The big banks</h3>
