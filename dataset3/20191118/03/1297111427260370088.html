      <p>Close, but no Grey Cup for the Saskatchewan Roughriders.</p>
      <p>The Winnipeg Blue Bombers turned back the Riders with two late goal-line stands en route to a 20-13 victory in Sunday’s West Division final.</p>

      <p>The Blue Bombers advanced to the 107<sup>th</sup> Grey Cup game on Nov. 24 in Calgary where they will play the Hamilton Tiger-Cats. Hamilton advanced to the CFL’s championship game by beating the visiting Edmonton Eskimos 36-16 in the East final.</p>
      <p>“We’re not going to the Grey Cup and it’s a big missed opportunity,” said Riders safety Mike Edem. “I don’t know what to say. We let our fans down. We let the organization down. We were supposed to make history.”</p>
      <p>“I feel like we played hard and the guys left it all out there. It just didn’t end the way we wanted it to,” added Riders middle linebacker Solomon Elimimian.</p>
      <p>“Hats off to Winnipeg. They played a complete game and they made more plays than us when it mattered.”</p>

      <p>The Riders are left to wonder what might have been after twice moving the ball to inside Winnipeg’s three-yard line, only to come away without a score.</p>
      <p>In the first instance, Riders short-yardage quarterback Bryan Bennett was trapped for a loss on second-and-goal from 1 1/2 yards away.</p>
      <p>With 2:37 remaining in the game, quarterback Cody Fajardo — a short-yardage specialist during his CFL career before becoming a starter with the Riders this season — was tackled for a loss on third-and-goal from the one.</p>
      <p>The Riders got the ball back with 43 seconds remaining and had another opportunity to tie the contest. Saskatchewan moved to Winnipeg’s five-yard line thanks to Kyran Moore making a diving grab for a 19-yard reception after the ball was deflected by Marcus Sayles.</p>
      <p>The Riders then had three chances to score in the final 20 seconds.</p>
      <p>Fajardo was sacked on the first play. A pass intended for Shaq Evans on second-and-goal from the eight was incomplete.</p>
      <p>Fajardo’s last-gasp pass attempt, intended for Moore, bounced off the crossbar and was declared a dead ball.</p>
      <p>“That’s probably one of the craziest things I’ve ever had (happen),” Fajardo said. “I just remember hitting that thing and the stadium was complete dead silence. I could just hear the echo of the iron when the ball hit it. It was just a rush of emotions.”</p>
      <p>Sunday’s result marked the second consecutive year the Blue Bombers have beaten the Riders in the playoffs at Mosaic Stadium. In 2018, Winnipeg defeated the Riders 23-18 in the West semifinal.</p>
      <p>“That’s two years in a row to Winnipeg at our crib,” said Riders defensive back Ed Gainey. “It just hurts that we can’t give our fans … a win at home when we needed it the most.”</p>

      <p>This year was different in that the Riders finished first in the West Division with a 13-5 record, earning a bye to the West final.</p>
      <p>“I’m getting too old for the season to be ending like this,” said Edem, 30. “It’s going to be a tough one. This one might hurt more than anyone maybe because we had first place, we had a week off and we didn’t pull through for the fans. Riderville, I’m sorry.”</p>
      <p>The extra rest was much-needed, considering that Fajardo was recovering from an injured oblique muscle that he suffered during a practice on Oct. 30. The Riders’ quarterback revealed after the game that he had two torn muscles in the oblique.</p>
      <p>“It’s admirable,” Elimimian said. “He wasn’t 100 per cent and we knew that. I felt like he did what we needed him to do. He just gave us a chance, but I don’t think we made enough plays on offence, defence or special teams to get the win.”</p>
      <p>Fajardo started and finished Sunday’s game despite the injury. The 27-year-old quarterback completed 27 of 41 passes for 366 yards, but didn’t connect on a touchdown pass and threw one interception.</p>
      <p>The contest marked the return of Zach Collaros to Mosaic Stadium. Collaros began the season as the Riders’ starting quarterback. He suffered a concussion after the third play of the regular-season opener after taking an illegal hit to the head.</p>
      <p>Fajardo took over from that point, leading the Riders to a 13-5 record and first place in the West Division.</p>
      <p>Fajardo performed so well that the Riders traded Collaros to the Toronto Argonauts in late July. Toronto later traded Collaros to the Blue Bombers for draft picks at the CFL’s Oct. 9 trade deadline.</p>
      <p>Collaros completed 17 of 25 passes for 267 yards and a touchdown on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Brett Lauther connected on all four of his field-goal attempts to account for the majority of the Riders’ scoring. Justin Medlock also connected on all four of his field goals, with Kenny Lawler scoring a touchdown for the Blue Bombers on a 26-yard pass from Collaros in the first quarter.</p>
