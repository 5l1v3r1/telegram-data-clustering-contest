      <p>Sen. Chuck Schumer on Sunday called on bargain stores to stop selling Chinese-made over-the-counter medications that may contain harmful ingredients.</p>
      <p>The products in question include skin creams and cosmetics that can cause infections, nausea or other symptoms, according to Schumer, and which may be on the shelves of the 170 Dollar Tree and Family Dollar stores in New York City and nearby suburbs.</p>
      <p>“You figure if you’re buying something without a prescription, it’s safe and it’s good,” said Schumer, standing outside a Dollar Tree in Harlem. “That is not necessarily the case when it comes to some of these products.</p>
      <p>“What makes it even more serious is we don’t exactly know which ones might be dangerous because China has such poor labeling, you don’t know what they put into each of these drugs,” he said.</p>
      <p>Representatives of Dollar Tree and Family Dollar did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>
