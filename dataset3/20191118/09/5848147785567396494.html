      <h1>Cristiano Ronaldo goal nets Portugal Euro 2020 berth</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T09:15:23+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 09:15</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://thenewdaily.com.au/author/aap/" target="_blank">AAP</a></address>
      <p>Portugal captain Cristiano Ronaldo scored his 99th international goal as the defending champions edged past Luxembourg 2-0 in difficult conditions away from home to qualify for Euro 2020.</p>
      <p>Bruno Fernandes broke the deadlock in the 39th minute and Ronaldo wrapped it up with four minutes left to ensure that Portugal finished second in Group B with 17 points, three ahead of Serbia who drew 2-2 with Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Diogo Jota’s shot appeared to be going in anyway but Ronaldo prodded it over to claim the goal.</p>
      <p>One more goal will see him join Iran’s Ali Daei in having scored a century of goals for a national team.</p>
      <p>Portugal survived several early scares as they struggled to impose their game on a rain-soaked pitch full of divots at the Josy Barthel stadium on Sunday.</p>

      <p>Ronaldo, in particular, was not enjoying the conditions and gestured angrily at the pitch after sending a speculative wide in the first half.</p>
      <p>Needing a win to qualify without having to worry about Serbia’s result, Portugal were in trouble early on as Luxembourg saw a chance to spring an upset.</p>
      <p>Maurice Deville got above his marker and headed over from Laurent Jans’ cross and Vincent Thill, a thorn in Portugal’s side, had a goal-bound shot blocked by Ruben Dias.</p>
      <p>Luxembourg were even closer when a corner found Gerons Rodrigues unmarked but he headed over.</p>
      <p>Portugal began to adapt to the conditions and their more direct approach was rewarded with a goal.</p>
      <p>Bernardo Silva floated a pass over the Luxembourg defence from deep inside his own half and into the path of Fernandes who took it superbly in his stride and fired a low shot between Anthony Moris and the near post.</p>
      <p>The second half was more comfortable for Portugal as they dominated possession although there still anxious moments.</p>
      <p>Ronaldo nearly sealed it when he curled a free kick narrowly wide from the edge of the area.</p>
      <p>With four minutes left, Silva’s cross found Jota and Moris got a hand to it but could not stop it crossing the line and Ronaldo poked it home for good measure.</p>
      <p>A stoppage time equaliser by late substitute Artem Besyedin gave Ukraine a 2-2 draw in Serbia after the home side led twice in the Group B qualifier on Sunday.</p>
      <p>The Ukrainians, who had already secured a berth in next year’s 24-nation tournament, finished their campaign top of the group on 20 points from eight games.</p>
      <p>A mere 4000 fans turned up at Rajko Mitic stadium although Serbia started the game with an outside chance of qualifying and the home side treated their supporters to a solid performance.</p>
      <p>England secured a place among the top six seeds after three late goals helped them to a 4-0 win in Kosovo in their final qualifier on Sunday.</p>
      <p>England, already assured of a place at the finals, finished top of Group A with 21 points from eight games, their only blip being last month’s 2-1 defeat in the Czech Republic, who have qualified as runners-up.</p>
      <p>In a subdued and sloppy first half England found a way through only once, when Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain slipped a pass for Harry Winks to tuck home his first international goal after 32 minutes.</p>

      <p>Captain Harry Kane then struck his 12th goal of the campaign in the 79th minute, Marcus Rashford added the third with a neat finish four minutes later and Mason Mount completed the scoring in stoppage time to give some gloss to the scoreline.</p>
      <p>Kosovo finished third on 11 points. Their chances of automatic qualification disappeared after a 2-1 defeat by the Czechs on Thursday but they could advance via the playoffs.</p>
