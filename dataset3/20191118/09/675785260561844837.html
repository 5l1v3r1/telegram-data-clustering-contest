      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> have been told they could've saved themselves £25m by signing Kieran Trippier instead of Aaron Wan-Bissaka.</p>
      <p>The Red Devils targeted young homegrown talent in the summer with Dan James and Harry Maguire arriving alongside the <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/crystal-palace-fc">Crystal Palace</a> academy graduate.</p>
      <p>But Steve Walsh, who helped mastermind Leicester's Premier League triumph in 2016 with the signings of Riyad Mahrez and N'Golo Kante, says he would've opted for the now Atletico Madrid fullback.</p>
      <p>Reservations still exist about Wan-Bissaka's ability to defend despite his athleticism and the former <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/everton-fc">Everton</a> Director of Football reckons United may have missed a beat.</p>
      <p>He told the <a href="https://theathletic.co.uk/1383451/2019/11/18/i-said-to-mourinho-you-have-to-be-careful-with-lukaku-hes-a-big-baby-walsh-on-managers-players-and-proving-vardy-wrong-about-frenchmen/">Athletic</a> : “United have made a lot of signings. Look at £50 million for Aaron Wan-Bissaka. Now, perhaps it is too early and he will improve, but my eyes tell me when he gets the ball he is not the best.</p>

      <p>"He is a good athlete and very quick, strong, and a good defender, but United don’t need a good defender, they need someone who can play, get on the ball.</p>
      <p>“If I had been at United, I would have said, ‘Put your £50 million away, go and get Kieran Trippier for half that. He is an England international.</p>
      <p>"He isn’t a great defender or a physical specimen, but he can play right-back and get the ball in early and you have strikers who can score goals.’ It is common sense.”</p>

      <p>Trippier has established himself at Atletico Madrid after moving from <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> following their loss in the Champions League final.</p>
      <p>Under the strict principles of Diego Simeone the Englishman has been part of a defence that has shipped just eight La Liga goals in 13 outings.</p>
      <p>Wan-Bissaka, in stark contrast, is part of a United defeat that has conceded a goal a game and struggled for consistency, but his performances have helped him earn a place in Gareth Southgate's England squad.</p>
