      <h3>200-player battles, Plunder and the chance to re-enter the contest.</h3>
      <p>A <i><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-4/">Call of Duty Modern Warfare</a> </i>battle royale will allegedly feature 200-player battles rather than the traditional 100-player ones, a new leak suggests.</p>
      <p>A huge amount of data has come through thanks to <i>Call of Duty</i> leaker <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/modernwarfare/comments/dx4me0/battle_royale_coming_to_modern_warfare_map/">Senscallo, who took to Reddit</a> to detail the increased player count alongside a number of other bits and pieces. While the revelation of a 200-player mode is interesting, it’s not the biggest bombshell. Perhaps most exciting is the concept of the Gulag, a location that players will visit once they’re eliminated; if a player can beat another player in a 1v1 gunfight, they’ll gain re-entry to the match. Only one 1v1 match will take place at a single time, meaning other players who’ve been felled will simply have to watch the action.</p>
      <p>Occasionally, the leak suggests the Gulag will experience a very occasional jailbreak, in which all players in the Gulag will be sent back into the match.</p>
      <p>Finally, thre’s the concept of bankable “plunder”, one first introduced to the genre <a href="https://stevivor.com/news/radical-heights-new-battle-royale-game-boss-key/">by Boss Key’s failed <i>Radical Heights</i></a>. Plunder is currency earned by completing missions or eliminating other players; you’ll need to deposit your currency into an in-game ATM to earn the persistent XP. As you’d expect, using an ATM will alert nearby players to your position.</p>

      <p>What do you make of this alleged news? We’re frankly excited.</p>
      <p><i><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-4/">Call of Duty Modern Warfare</a></i> is currently available on Windows PC, Xbox One and PS4; there’s no word on when the battle royale will be introduced to the game.</p>
