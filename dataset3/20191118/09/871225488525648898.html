      <h2>We speak to MSL about winning a hat trick of awards at the 2019 Influencer Marketing Awards.</h2>

      <h3>Congratulations on winning the Best Family &amp; Parenting Campaign, Most Effective Collaboration or Partnership award and the Grand Prix. What has changed for you since winning the three awards?</h3>
      <p>Thank you! We’re delighted to have <a href="https://influencermarketingawards.com/2019/winners/">won three awards </a>for our #<a href="https://talkinginfluence.com/2019/04/16/behindcardoors-how-msl-and-renault-achieved-an-ambitious-year-long-influencer-campaign/">BehindClosedDoors</a> campaign. Since then we’ve gone from strength to strength, winning influencer briefs from new clients and being asked to speak at events. Last month, we spoke at the Influencer Marketing Show and we sponsored PR Week’s Breakfast Briefing, which was a great platform for us to share our latest influencer research. We’ve launched a new tool called Fluency, too, which combines data and strategic expertise to provide an end-to-end influencer marketing service. </p>
      <h3>Why do you think events like the <a href="https://influencermarketingawards.com/2020/">Influencer Marketing Awards</a> are so important for our industry?</h3>
      <p>We love the awards as they’re a source of inspiration and a chance to come together to celebrate great work. But more than that – they’re also helping to shape the future of influencer marketing, which often gets bad press by challenging perceptions, setting standards and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible.</p>
      <h3>What do you think makes an award-winning campaign? </h3>
      <p>Award-winning campaigns solve a genuine problem in an interesting way. Friction makes fire, and overcoming challenges often leads to the most powerful work. The best campaigns make you feel something – and more often than not that’s because they’re fuelled by a human or cultural insight that resonates with people. But, our emotional response is only half the answer; measurement is critical too. For a campaign to be worthy of an award, it needs to hit business objectives and prove it. </p>
      <h3>What challenges did you face in your campaign and how did you overcome them?</h3>
      <p>Our brief was to put the Renault Scenic on the map as a modern family car. There were all sorts of challenges but one of the biggest was the question of how to create an emotional connection with our audience. We tackled that with the insight that cars are the new kitchen tables, where families have their most intimate conversations — and worked with parenting influencers Mother Pukka and Father of Daughters to capture, via dash-cam, the often-hilarious and always-revealing moments that only take place behind car doors.</p>
      <p>We knew that shifting perceptions of the Renault Scenic wouldn’t happen overnight, so we had to build longevity into our campaign, too. This led us to create a year-long always-on content programme that would give our audience a chance to get to know the car and build positive associations with the brand over time. </p>
