      <p>The South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) has announced that its beneficiaries would receive their grant money for December on the 28th of November.</p>
      <p>"The early December payment should not be seen as a bonus or double payment as it is mainly intended for the convenience of beneficiaries. Sassa does not pay a bonus at all and beneficiaries are paid for twelve months only per year," Sassa said in a statement.</p>
      <p>The agency urged beneficiaries to protect their PIN codes and avoid giving strangers their ID numbers even if they claimed to be from Sassa, as the festive season tends to see an increase in scams to defraud beneficiaries and to be mindful of scams operated through WhatsApp, mobile phone messages and social media.</p>
      <p>Beneficiaries are urged to be vigilant at all times and to double-check information, especially if it sounds too good to be true.</p>
      <p>The following grant payment will be on the 29th of December.</p>
