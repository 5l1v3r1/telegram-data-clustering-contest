      <h1>Google Stadia Game Lineup Grows To 22 Titles At Launch, Here’s What’s New</h1>

      <p>Oh, the joys of marketing. Here we are just a day away from the <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/google-stadia-gaming-launches-november-19">launch of Stadia</a>, Google's highly anticipated cloud gaming service, and we have just learned it will debut with nearly double the number of games from what was original announced. This addresses one of the points of initial criticism, and there's little doubt in my mind that the sudden uptick in day-one titles is a strategic announcement.<br/><br/>That's to say, I have a hard time believing there was anything technical behind this announcement, which might have made possible a greater number of games suddenly being available. Not that it matters—when Stadia launches tomorrow, it will have 22 games available to play, 10 more than <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/google-stadia-app-play-store-red-dead-2-borderlands-3-cyberpunk-2077">previously announced</a>, and of course the catalog will grow over time.<br/><br/>"Alongside our publisher and developer partners, we’ve been working around the clock on getting ready for Stadia's launch, and we are adding more incredible titles to our day one launch line-up. Gamers will have a total of 22 titles available to choose from to experience Stadia for the first time on Tuesday, with more games coming by the end of the year," Google said.<br/><br/>Here's the full list of the nearly two dozen games that will be available to play on <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/google-vows-stadia-games-playable-developers-pull-plug">Stadia</a> tomorrow...</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Assassin's Creed Odyssey</li>
        <li>
          <b>Attack on Titan: Final Battle 2</b>
        </li>
        <li>Destiny 2: The Collection (available in Stadia Pro)</li>
        <li>
          <b>Farming Simulator 2019</b>
        </li>

        </li>

        <li>Tomb Raider 2013</li>
        <li>
          <b>Trials Rising</b>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Wolfenstein: Youngblood</b>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>I've bolded the 10 new additions to launch day. Several of those games are ones Google listed as being promised for a 2019 debut. Originally consisting of 14 titles, that list has been whittled down to the following....</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Borderlands 3</li>
        <li>Darksiders: Genesis</li>
        <li>Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2</li>
        <li>Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Breakpoint</li>
        <li>Trials Rising</li>
      </ol>
      <p>So in total, Stadia will have at least 27 games available by the end of the year, including Borderlands, which has been prominently featured in the <a href="https://hothardware.com/news/google-stadia-app-play-store-red-dead-2-borderlands-3-cyberpunk-2077">Stadia app</a>.</p>

      <p>Looking ahead to 2020, Google says "many more titles" are on tap, including Doom: Eternal, Watchdogs: Legion, Gods &amp; Monsters, and Cyberpunk 2077. The games tab on Stadia's product page also lists a bunch more (presumably for 2020), with titles such as Orcs Must Die 3, Supercross 3, The Elder Scrolls Online, and others splashed across the page.<br/><br/>Stadia launches on Tuesday, November 19, in 14 territories.</p>
