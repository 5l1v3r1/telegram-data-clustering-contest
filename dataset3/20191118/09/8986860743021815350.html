      <p>Slay queen cum actress and television presenter Efia Odo has bemoaned why some Ghanaians find it difficult to see the good in anything that she does.</p>
      <p>Her comments come after some section of Ghanaians took to social media to blast her for her choice of dress to the just-ended 4syte TV’s Music video awards.</p>
      <p>She posted:</p>
      <p>
        <i>”I don’t disrespect anyone , I stay in my own lane doing things that makes ME happy. Sad how my own people don’t see the good in me. Hurts because I love y’all sooo much and you guys just throw stones at me each time. It’s all good tho, in the end I still have nothing but love”.</i>

      <p>She continued;</p>
      <p>
        <i>”Only religion I practice is love. Being religious is too hard. I don’t wanna be a hypocrite neither do I want to discriminate another due to our differences In “sin”. My God teaches me to love and accept each one as they are, whether I agree with their life or not. “</i>
