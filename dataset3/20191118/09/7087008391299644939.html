      <h1>Ridiculous: McAfee Gives Away 10% Supply Of Epstein Didn’t Kill Himself Token (WHACKD)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T09:10:51+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 09:10</time> by <a rel="author">George Georgiev</a></address>
      <p>Well-known entrepreneur and cryptocurrency proponent, John McAfee, recently launched an ERC-20 based token called WHACKD. The full rubric of the token is “Epstein Didn’t Kill Himself,” and it was announced back on November 11th. Now, however, McAfee has said that he will give away 10% of the total supply of WHACKD to the winners of a new meme contest.</p>
      <h3>Gifting WHACKD To Meme Contest Winners</h3>
      <p>The circumstances surrounding Jeffrey Epstein’s death caught the attention of the people around the world. Many of them – including McAfee himself – are convinced that the disgraced American financier and convicted sex offender did not commit suicide, which was reported as the “official” cause of death.</p>
      <p>The creator of what is arguably one of the most popular and commonly used antivirus software on the planet <a href="https://cryptopotato.com/john-mcafee-to-defend-jeffrey-epstein-no-evidence-showing-he-committed-suicide/">openly said</a> that there is no conclusive evidence that Epstein killed himself, as is the original version.</p>
      <p>Moreover, McAfee decided to voice his opinion through a cryptocurrency. On November 11th, he launched a token called Epstein Didn’t Kill Himself using the ticker symbol WHACKD.</p>
      <p>Just a few days later, he launched an “Epstein Didn’t Kill Himself” meme contest and announced that the winners will receive 10% of the total supply of WHACKD.</p>

      <p>The winners will be announced on November 24th. The WHACKD token is currently traded on McAfee’s decentralized exchange, but the volume is negligible.</p>
      <h3>Getting WHACKD</h3>
      <p>The token behind “Epstein Didn’t Kill Himself” was <a href="https://twitter.com/officialmcafee/status/1195658344129794048">distributed</a> via an airdrop beginning November 16th. There were over 50,000 sign-ups for the token, according to McAfee. Obviously, the idea behind the cryptocurrency is to spread further awareness, rather than having any actual use cases at all.</p>
      <blockquote>“Wed over 50,000sign-ups for the WHACKD airdrop. The airdrops are going out. It will take a little time, so please be patient. We expected less than 5,000, and we were not prepared for the volume. You WILL get your tokens, so relax.” –  McAfee said.</blockquote>
      <p>The tokens are deflationary and 10% of transactions, as well as 1 out of 1000 transactions, will be burned. This is where the name WHACKD comes from.</p>
