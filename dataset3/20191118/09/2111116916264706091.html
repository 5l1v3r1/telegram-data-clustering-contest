      <p>Realme is going to launch its first flagship phone in India, the Realme X2 Pro, on November 20. Ahead of its imminent launch, the pre-orders have gone live for interested buyers on company's website.Â </p>
      <p>The 'Blind Order' requires customers to pay a deposit amount of Rs 1,000 for placing the order for the Realme X2 Pro. The company has 855 units of the phone up for pre-order. After the phone is launched, pre-order customers need to pay the balance amount until November 21, following which the phone will be shipped by Realme.</p>
      <p>Realme X2 Pro is priced starting CNY 2,699 in China which roughly translates to Rs 28,000. We expect the Indian pricing to be around the same price point.</p>
