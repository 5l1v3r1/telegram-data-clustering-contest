      <p><a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/ford">Ford</a> has officially unveiled the <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/ford-mustang">Mustang</a> Mach-E, its first vehicle in 55 years to expand upon the traditional sports-coupe line-up with the introduction of an all-electric four-door crossover SUV.</p>
      <p>There are a number of different power options and specs available for the Mach-E, from the standard 75.7-kWh battery and rear-wheel drive iteration offering 255 BHP and 306 lb-ft of torque, to the range-leading Mustang Mach-E GT and GT Performance Edition.</p>
      <p>Each of these delivers 459 BHP and 612 lb-ft of torque, with the GT Performance Edition aiming for a 0-60 MPH time in the mid-3-seconds range. Keeping in tune with the sporting heritage of the Mustang lineage, customers will be able to equip Brembo’s all-new performance Flexira aluminum calipers and can experience the full potential of the all-new car with help from a suspension system similar to that found in high-end performance Mustangs.</p>

      <p>Ford is aiming for 230 miles of range on the standard edition, 210 miles on the all-wheel-drive variant — which can adjust torque output at the front and rear for better handling — and with a long-range 98.8-kWh battery pack, Ford estimates the rear-wheel-drive offering will achieve at least 300 miles.</p>
      <p>Outside, the Mach-E echoes a number of Mustang design elements with its bulbous fenders, triple-bar tail lights and poised headlights. Its front hood receives a lightly-sculpted finish, while its rear is reflective of the current Mustang offerings. Prices will start at $43,895 USD for the standard edition, while the range-topping GT will command $60,500 USD before taxes and charges.</p>
