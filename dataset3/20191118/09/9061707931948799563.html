      <p>Supporters of SV2 (Supporting Victims of Sexual Violence Ltd) in Derbyshire teamed up with the White Horse, Morledge for a charity fundraiser.</p>
      <p>Raising funds to support Springfields Primary School and SV2, a host of volunteers, staff, performers, friends and family joined forces to raise awareness and celebrate. Among the attractions were performances from The Village, Mae Monypenny, Inanna Street, Rex Portillano-Barr, Angela Martin and Pippa Nayer. All of whom were supported by the White Horse's DJ MINTY.</p>
      <p>SV2 service users and volunteers put on a spectacular homemade cake display, including the very first SV2 signature cake. There was hot food available and tabletop sales throughout the day. SV2 organised raffles and tombola with prizes gratefully donated from many local businesses.</p>
      <p>SV2’s chief executive officer said “We are extremely grateful to the hardworking supporters and volunteers who worked really hard to pull this event together and to those who so generously donated, we really appreciate it."</p>
      <p>Mark Walsh (landlord of the White Horse) said: "It was a well run charity event and considering the bad weather there was a great turnout and a fantastic atmosphere.</p>
      <p>"We would like to thank the fundraisers, performers, volunteers and customers for all the hard work and monies raised for worthy causes."</p>
      <p>Cindy Carter-Foster (events organiser) said: "Throughout the process we were supported by many local businesses, volunteers and performers who gratefully donated their time, services and products. It would be impossible to list them all.</p>
      <p>"The White Horse donated the space, technicians, Dj and equipment, without which it wouldn't have been possible. Myself and the dance troup (Inanna Street) extend our sincere gratitude to everyone involved and hope the charities benefit from the proceeds. We work extremely hard for local charities but it all relies on good will. Once again, I am overwhelmed by the power of people."</p>
