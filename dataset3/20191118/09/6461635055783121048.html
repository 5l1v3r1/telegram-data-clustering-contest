      <h3>Spain’s Dani Olmo wants to keep an option to return to Barcelona open due to the youngster’s desire to play in La Liga in the future.</h3>
      <p>The 21-year-old was a student of Barcelona’s famous academy- La Masia= before leaving for the Croatian side, Dinamo Zagreb, in 2014. The youngster currently plays a crucial role in the midfield of the Croatian club.</p>
      <p>Olmo has expressed his desires for playing in the Spanish League, stating “I hope i can come back” [Source: <a href="https://www.sport-english.com/en/news/barca/spains-dani-olmo-barcelona-return-i-am-not-closing-any-door-7738601"><b>Sport</b></a>]</p>
      <p>This has raised speculations about his return to Barcelona, having previously played in La Masia, to which the midfielder said, “he does not close the door to any club.”</p>
      <p>Dani spent seven years in La Masia before departing the club. He recalled what stayed with him after spending all those years in the youth academy,</p>
      <blockquote>With what you learn, the values you are taught. Also Barcelona’s style: touch, movement. That’s added to what I have learned in Croatia, they’ve made me the player I am now.</blockquote>
      <p>The Spaniard has been linked to plenty of teams, including Real Madrid and Manchester United, and would most likely make his move out of Croatia in the upcoming transfer window or the following summer. Even the Dinamo Zagreb’s coach, Nenad Bjelica, has <a href="https://www.goal.com/en-bh/news/hes-ready-man-utd-and-barcelona-linked-olmo-tipped-to-join/hrd0sr2nvbh31ktqrwcait0wj"><b>confirmed</b></a> offers from many European clubs and also stated that Olmo is ready to play in the big leagues.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard is in fantastic form and recently scored for the national team in their 7-0 win over Malta. He will look to continue this as long as possible in order to attract many European giants.</p>
      <p>Do you think Dani Olma is a good fit for Barcelona?</p>
