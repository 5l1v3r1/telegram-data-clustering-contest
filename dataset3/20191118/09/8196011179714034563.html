      <p>Four people have been killed and six more wounded after “unknown suspects” sneaked into a garden party in California and fired into a crowd.</p>
      <p>The shooting took place about 6pm local time as people were gathered to watch a football game, Fresno Police Lieutenant Bill Dooley said.</p>

      <p>Deputy Chief Michael Reid told the Fresno Bee and local TV stations that a total of 10 people were shot, with three found dead in the backyard. A fourth person died in hospital. Six others are expected to survive and are recovering at the hospital.</p>
      <p>All the victims were Asian men ranging from 25 to 35 years old.</p>
      <p>Mr Dooley said: “What we do know is that this was a gathering, a family and friend gathering in the backyard. Everyone was watching football this evening when unknown suspects approached the residence, snuck into the backyard and opened fire.”</p>
      <p>The victims were taken to Community Regional Medical Centre in critical condition, and some are now stable, the TV stations reported.</p>
      <p>About 35 people were at the party when the shooting began.</p>

      <p>No one is in custody in connection with the shooting. Police said there was no immediate indication that the victims knew the perpetrators.</p>
      <p>Police are going door-to-door in search of surveillance video that might help them track down the suspects. The shooting took place about half a mile from the city’s airport.</p>
      <p>Agents from the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives field office in San Francisco were responding to the shooting, the Bee reported.</p>
      <p>It was at least the second fatal gun attack on Sunday in southeast Fresno, the Bee reported. A man in his 20s was shot to death at a home in another part of the city. Police have not said whether the incidents could be connected.</p>

      <p>Sunday’s shootings in Fresno also come on the heels of at least two mass shootings in California. On Thursday, a 16-year-old student at a Southern California high school shot and killed two classmates and wounded three other teenagers before shooting himself in the head. He died the next day.</p>
      <p>And on Saturday, police in San Diego said a husband shot and killed his wife and three of their sons before killing himself. A fourth son wounded in the shooting was on life support on Sunday, family members said.</p>
