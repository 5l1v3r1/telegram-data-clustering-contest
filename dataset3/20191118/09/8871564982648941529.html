      <h1>Kuta Police arrest Mauritanian woman for allegedly stealing credit card and spending IDR400 million in Bali</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T09:42:37+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 09:42</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Bali" target="_blank">Coconuts Bali</a></address>
      <p>Police in Kuta said they recently arrested a Mauritanian woman after she allegedly stole a British tourist’s credit card and used it to purchase more than IDR400 million worth of goods in Bali.</p>
      <p>According to local media reports, police said that the British tourist, identified as Holly Jemima Hartley, lost her credit card on Oct. 21, not long after checking in at a hostel in Seminyak.</p>
      <p>Hartley didn’t notice that she had lost her belongings, until she received a call from her father about a large transaction amounting to £22,765 (IDR414 million) on her credit card. Upon realizing that she had lost her credit card and driver’s license, she proceeded to file a report to the Kuta Police.</p>
      <p>“Based on a print-out of bank transaction that the victim provided us, a team from the Kuta Police immediately headed to one of the places where the transaction took place,” Ika Prabawa from the Kuta Police told reporters earlier today.</p>
      <p>Authorities were able to confirm with surveillance cameras that two women were there to make the transaction. One of them was identified as a foreigner, while the other an Indonesian.</p>

      <p>Police alleged that the women went shopping around Mal Bali Galeria in Kuta, including at a mobile phone and jewellery store. The women were then tracked down, and a Mauritanian woman identified as Roughaya Abeidi was arrested on Oct. 31 at a villa in Seminyak.</p>
      <p>Though Abeidi is suspected to have committed the crime along with an Indonesian woman, the latter has yet to be identified and is still considered a witness in the case.</p>
      <p>“Based on our initial interrogation, the suspect admitted to have done several transactions at MBG [Mal Bali Galeria]. She said she’s only done this once, and had found the credit card on the side of the street,” Ika said, as quoted by Detik.</p>
      <p>Under Indonesia’s criminal code, Abeidi faces a maximum of five years’ imprisonment if convicted.</p>
