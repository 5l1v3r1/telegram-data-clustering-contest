      <h1>Stonebwoy jabs Kelvyn Boy on stage at the 4Syte Music Video Awards ’19</h1>

      <p>It seems Stonebwoy is still pissed about his brouhaha with his former signee, Kelvyn Boy and how they parted ways.</p>
      <p>Stonebwoy has sent another jab directed at Kelvyn Boy whiles performing at the 2019 4Syte Music Video Awards.</p>

      <p>Stonebwoy paused in the middle of his performance and encouraged Ghanaians to protect him, Shatta Wale and Sarkodie because they are national assets.</p>
      <p>He added that it will take 40 years for Ghana to get such perfect artists like themselves in this country so Ghanaians can choose to protect them or ignore but they are national assets.</p>
      <p>He also sent a shout out to his godfather, Samini who was in the auditorium and showed his maximum respect to him.</p>

      <p>He then sent a fresh jab to upcoming artists like Kelvyn Boy who does not show respect to their bosses.</p>
      <p>Although Stonebwoy did not directly name the owner of the shade, it’s not far fetched to know it was for his former artist, Kelvyn Boy who left his label to sign under Blakk Cedis’ label when Blakk still managed Stonebwoy and Kelvyn Boy was still signed under Burniton Music Group</p>
      <p>Stonebwoy said: <i>“Big up to Samini, my godfather, and the upcoming wey dem no dey respect, dem for sit well.”</i></p>
