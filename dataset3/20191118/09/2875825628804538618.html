      <h1>Swedish referee Martin Hansson who missed Thierry Henry handball speaks out ten years after Ireland's agony</h1>
      <h2>Ireland's World Cup dreams were dashed in the most controversial circumstances</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T09:35:40+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 09:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/eamon-doggett/" target="_blank">Eamon Doggett</a></address>
      <p>Tens years on and Swedish referee who failed to spot Thierry Henry's handball has admitted he will never speak to the Frenchman again.</p>
      <p>On 18 November 2009, <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/republic-of-ireland-soccer">Ireland's World Cup dreams </a>were dashed in the most controversial circumstances when Henry twice handled the ball before setting up William Gallas to score.</p>
      <p>The extra-time scenes in the Stade de France made <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/thierry-henry">Henry</a> a public enemy in Ireland and saw the officiating team subject to widespread criticism.</p>
      <p>And on the tenth anniversary of the famous incident, the man in the middle Martin Hansson has admitted he would not talk to Henry if given the chance.</p>

      <p>"I won't speak with him," he told The Athletic who tracked him down to a farmhouse in the Swedish town of Holmsjo.</p>
      <p>Hansson also revealed he and his fellow officials hugged and high-fived after game in the belief that they done well.</p>
      <p>Hansson said: "It was something we did before, and after, every game.</p>
      <p>"When I went into that room I really thought it was one of the best games of my career. It's not so often, as a referee, you look forward to extra-time but, for this game, that was how I felt.</p>
      <p>"I was in a good point of my career. I had refereed the Confederations Cup final earlier in the year. I really thought I had had a good game."</p>
      <p>Things changed quickly though when an official from the FAI entered the referee's dressing room.</p>
      <p>Hansson and his officiating team quickly became aware that they had made a terrible mistake.</p>
      <p>"We knew by that stage, of course. We knew what it meant for Ireland and we also knew that, for us (his refereeing team), the World Cup in South Africa didn't exist any more.</p>
      <p>"He wanted to shake our hands. 'Gentlemen,' he said, 'of course it is a mistake but we blame the player, we don't blame you. It's big, big cheating from the player'. That was unbelievably good of him."</p>
      <p>Hansson added: "It was the worst performance of my career.</p>
      <p>"I'm just grateful that I had very good friends during that time. I had a lot of support. Referees from all over Europe were texting me. Many more than I would ever have thought.</p>
      <p>"It was a catastrophe for Ireland. They were so close to the World Cup, and it's such a big thing. Fantastic people, too."</p>
