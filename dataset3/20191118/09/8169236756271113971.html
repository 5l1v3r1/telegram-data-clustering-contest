        <b>Liverpool have reportedly begun talks over sealing the transfer of RB Leipzig striker and Manchester United target Timo Werner.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Germany international has been a big hit in the Bundesliga in recent times and looks like he could be a great fit for most bigger clubs around Europe.</p>
      <h3>MORE: <a href="https://www.caughtoffside.com/2019/11/17/18m-liverpool-target-drops-transfer-hint-after-anfield-comments/">£18m Liverpool target drops transfer hint after Anfield comments</a></h3>
      <p>It remains to be seen where Werner will end up when he does inevitably move on, but it currently looks like Liverpool could be his most likely destination.</p>
      <p>That’s according to the <a href="https://play.acast.com/s/thetransferwindow/12809eec-fcde-465c-a709-b2cf6e61274f">Transfer Window Podcast</a>, as they explain the Reds have opened talks over a deal for Werner, leaving rivals Man Utd in their wake.</p>
      <p>Liverpool will now hope to get this deal wrapped up in the near future, and it seems United are meanwhile dithering over a number of potential options up front.</p>

      <p>The Red Devils have also been linked with Erling Haaland, Mario Mandzukic and Moussa Dembele, so may not be making Werner as much of a priority.</p>

      <p>However, the Transfer Window Podcast do claim they’ve been scouting the 23-year-old heavily in recent times, so it could still be that they’ll do their best to get back into pole position over this transfer.</p>
      <p>Werner seems an ideal fit for LFC, however, with fellow German Jurgen Klopp showing he can work wonders with talented young players, particularly in attack.</p>
