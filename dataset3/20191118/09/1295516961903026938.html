      <p>It appears award season cinematic fare is already dominating the domestic box office as <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/ford-v-ferrari/">Ford v. Ferrari</a> has significantly outpaced the latest <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/charlies-angels/">Charlie's Angels</a> reboot, as both films opened in theaters everywhere this past weekend.</p>
      <p>The historical sports film starring Matt Damon and Christian Bale surpassed initial industry analyst estimates, earning $31 million at the domestic box office its opening weekend. Predictions going into the weekend had predicted the film would <a href="https://www.cbr.com/ford-v-ferrari-expected-to-speed-past-charlies-angels-at-box-office/">earn $20-30 million</a>, with the sports drama boosted by strong critical reviews and positive word-of-mouth from audiences.</p>

      <p>In comparison, <i>Charlie's Angels</i> underperformed against initial projections, earning $8.6 million domestically, with early predictions putting it on pace for $10-12 million. The film has earned $19 million from overseas markets but still has a ways to go before it recoups its $48 million production budget -- before factoring in marketing and distribution expenses.</p>
      <p>The reboot is the latest high-profile film to stumble at the box office, following on the heels of <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/terminator-6/">Terminator: Dark Fate</a> currently sitting on a disappointing $233.7 million worldwide total against a production budget of $196 million, and <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/doctor-sleep/">Doctor Sleep</a> earning $53.8 million against a budget of $55 million.</p>

      <p>In the meantime, <a href="https://www.cbr.com/tag/joker-film/">Joker</a> continues to be a consistently strong performer, over a month into its wide theatrical release. Going into the weekend, the DC Comics film became the first R-rated movie to earn <a href="https://www.cbr.com/joker-movie-1-billion-box-office/">over $1 billion</a> at the worldwide box office, continuing its momentum.</p>
      <p>Directed by James Mangold and written by Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth and Jason Keller, <i>Ford v Ferrari </i>stars Matt Damon, Christian Bale, Jon Bernthal, Caitriona Balfe, Tracy Letts, Josh Lucas, Noah Jupe, Remo Girone and Ray McKinnon. It opens in theaters on Nov. 15.</p>
