      <p>Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray has postponed his visit to Ayodhya, considering the ongoing political deadlock in Maharashtra and the farmer distress in the state following incessant rains. Thackeray's first visit to Ayodhya since the historic verdict pronounced on November 9, was likely to be scheduled on November 24. </p>
      <blockquote>Currently, Shiv Sena has been in logjams with ideologically differing Congress and NCP to form a government in the state. Pertaining to the political situation, the chiefs of NCP and Congress-- Sharad Pawar and Sonia Gandhi will be holding a meeting on Monday to further ponder over a probable alliance with Shiv Sena and to chalk out a common minimum program. </blockquote>
      <p>Sources in the Congress and NCP said the draft common minimum program and allocation of portfolios between the three parties will be discussed in the meeting. On Saturday, Shiv Sena spokesperson <a href="https://www.republicworld.com/india-news/politics/sanjay-raut-takes-power-hungry-jibe-at-former-cm-fadnavis.html">Sanjay Raut</a> claimed that Uddhav Thackeray would be the Chief Minister of Maharashtra. Union Minister and Republican Party of India (A) chief Ramdas Athawle on Sunday <a href="https://www.republicworld.com/india-news/politics/bjp-needs-to-think-of-offering-cm-post-to-sena-says-ramdas-athawale.html">suggested </a>that the BJP needs to think of sharing the post of Chief Minister with Shiv Sena for the sake of government formation in Maharashtra. Athawale was speaking to ANI after attending the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) meeting at the Parliament House in New Delhi. </p>

      <blockquote>"They should sit together and find a solution. BJP needs to think of offering CM post to Sena for a few years if it can bring a solution," said Ramdas asserting that the two parties must compromise and get back together as allies.</blockquote>
      <h3>Shiv Sena's Ayodhya pitch </h3>
      <p>In November 2018, Uddhav Thackeray had launched the 'Chalo Ayodhya' movement chanting the slogan Pehle Mandir Fir Sarkar (First construct the temple, then form the government) ahead of the Lok Sabha 2019 polls. Propelling a movement for the construction of a temple on Ayodhya land, hundreds of Shiv Sena workers, filled trains and flights to reach the location. </p>

      <blockquote>Thackeray on November 9 said the BJP-led government cannot take the "credit" for the Supreme Court's verdict on Ayodhya. Even last year in October, prior to Thackeray's Ayodhya visit, the Shiv Sena chief had attacked ex-ally, the BJP over the Ram Mandir issue, saying, "The BJP said that work on the Ram Temple will start soon, but nobody really knows when… This means the ‘Ram Temple card’ will be played again during elections." </blockquote>
