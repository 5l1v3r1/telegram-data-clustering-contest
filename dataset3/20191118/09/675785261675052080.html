      <h1>Harry Redknapp makes Premier League top four prediction</h1>
      <h2>Tottenham, Arsenal and Man Utd are all facing a battle to qualify for next season's Champions League but Liverpool, Man City and Chelsea are sitting pretty in the Premier League</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T09:06:46+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 09:06</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Smith</a></address>
      <p>Harry Redknapp reckons Tottenham, Arsenal and Manchester United are all facing an up-hill battle to qualify for next season's Champions League.</p>
      <p>At least three of the traditional top six Premier League sides look set to miss out on a top four spot this year.</p>
      <p>Runaway leaders Liverpool and reigning champions <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> are seen as almost dead certs to qualify for the premium European competition, with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/chelsea-fc">Chelsea</a> and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/leicester-city-fc">Leicester</a> enjoying good starts to the season.</p>
      <p>That could mean Spurs, the Gunners and United - who are 14th, sixth and seventh respectively - could be forced to play in the Europa League, or miss out on travelling the continent at all.</p>

      <p>Mauricio Pochettino's men are in the biggest danger of failing to qualify, despite reaching the final last season, having only won three times in the league this campaign.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a> , who are facing a crisis with fans furious at manager Unai Emery, and United have also suffered indifferent opening three months and sit just off the pace.</p>

      <p>" <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a> have it all on now to get in the top four this year," Redknapp told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10364282/harry-redknapp-dele-alli-tottenham-top-four/"><i>The Sun</i> </a>.</p>
      <p>"The only thing now in their favour is that Arsenal look so poor. Chelsea are doing great, they’re going to be challenging. Leicester are going to be bang in there.</p>
      <p>"But you’re looking at Arsenal — and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> — and wondering if they are going to make it this year. I can see both of those two not making the top four unless there is a big improvement.</p>
      <p>"It’s been a disappointing season so far for Spurs. I really thought they would be close to Manchester City and <a href="https://www.goal.com/en/team/liverpool/c8h9bw1l82s06h77xxrelzhur">Liverpool</a> and challenging.</p>
      <p>"It’s difficult. The players haven’t hit the form they did last year. I’m a big fan of the manager and hopefully they can turn it around."</p>
