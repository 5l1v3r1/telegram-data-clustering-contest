      <p>OZARK, Ala. (AP) — Jury selection is beginning in the murder trial of an Alabama police officer charged with killing an unarmed black man.</p>
      <p>Montgomery police Officer Aaron Cody Smith is charged in the 2016 shooting death of 58-year-old Gregory Gunn. Potential jurors reported Monday.</p>
      <p>Smith maintains he shot Gunn in self-defense.</p>
      <p>The shooting happened as Gunn was walking in a neighborhood and Smith asked him to submit to a frisk.</p>
      <p>News outlets report Smith testified in a 2018 hearing that Gunn fled.</p>
      <p>Smith said he used a stun gun and baton, and then pulled his gun because he thought Gunn was arming himself with a painter’s pole from a porch. Gunn was shot five times.</p>
      <p>The trial was moved to Ozark after defense lawyers argued Smith couldn’t get a fair trial in Montgomery.</p>
