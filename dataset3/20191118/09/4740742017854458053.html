      <h1>Salmon on song as Bristol City claim point in six-goal WSL thriller against Reading FC</h1>
      <h2>The Robins came back from 3-1 down</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T09:20:55+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 09:20</time> by <a rel="author">Jake Russell</a></address>
      <p>Ebony Salmon fired in a dramatic late leveller as the points where shared in a six-goal thriller at the Madjeski Stadium.</p>
      <p>Reading made the early inroads in this crunch WSL clash, Remi Allen and Brooke Chaplen scoring inside the opening 20 minutes.</p>
      <p>But they were pegged back before the break by Charlie Wellings’ strike before restoring a two-goal lead when Angharad James netted at the start of the second period.</p>
      <p>But Yana Daniels summoned an immediate response before Salmon’s late leveller.</p>
      <h3>Key moments</h3>
      <p>Chaplen was at her creative best in the early exchanges for the home side, and Fara Williams twice came close to opening the scoring.</p>
      <p>But it was Allen who got on the scoresheet first, getting on the end of James’ flick-on and slotting home.</p>
      <p>One became two soon after, Chaplen capitalising on a poor clearance to round the keeper and double the lead.</p>
      <p>Bristol needed a response before the break and Wellings provided it with a fine turn and finish into the bottom corner.</p>

      <p>Kristine Leine missed a fine chance on the stroke of half-time, but the Royals’ third arrived soon after the resumption, James rising high to head home Williams’ corner for her first goal for the club.</p>
      <p>But when Salmon got clear down the left and pulled back for Daniels, the replacement scrambled it home and Bristol were back in it.</p>
      <p>The Royals then spurned chances to put the game to bed, and it came back to haunt them when Salmon burst clear and kept her cool.</p>
      <h3>Goal of the match</h3>
      <p>This was a match Reading had more than enough chances to win. But their profligacy came back to haunt them late on when the industrious Salmon broke free, rounded Grace Moloney and slotted home.</p>

      <h3>What they said</h3>
      <p><b>Bristol manager Tanya Oxtoby: </b>“The application and execution of what we asked of the girls away from home was exceptional and we showed unbelievable character.</p>
      <p>“That just shows what this group have in their locker. There have been some good performances and they have been a bit unlucky, so I am really pleased for them that they got a point today.”</p>
      <p><b>Reading's Charlie Wellings: </b>That was a team performance, we dug it out. We were down two goals earls and it’s always tough to come back from that.</p>
      <p>It just shows the character in the team and the fight to come and get a point in a place like this.”</p>
