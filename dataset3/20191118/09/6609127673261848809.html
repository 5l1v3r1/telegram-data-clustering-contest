        <b>SCOTT SINCLAIR may be out of the picture at Celtic but he says he's focused and ready - and his missus Helen Flanagan has joked she's ready too.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/sport/football/team/14914/celtic/">Hoops</a> star uploaded a snap to Instagram looking ripped as he continues to work hard to force his way into Neil Lennon's side.</p>

      <p>Sinclair has only featured in six times this campaign from the bench and has hit two goals.</p>
      <p>The 30-year-old attacker is currently in Dubai as the domestic action takes a short-break due to the international break.</p>
      <p>And he's showed he is in peak physical condition.</p>
      <p>He wrote: "No matter what the situation, I'm focused and ready...!"</p>

      <p>His partner Helen Flanagan was clearly excited and joked: "I'm ready too ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜œ xxx"</p>
      <p>Aston Villa assistant boss John Terry, who knows the attacker from their time at Chelsea together joked that his legs needed some work.</p>
      <p>He added: "ðŸ’ª Don't forget the legs geezÂ  ðŸ˜‚"</p>
      <p>Sinclair has found squad time difficult to come by after falling behind Mohamed Elyounoussi and Mikey Johnston in the pecking order.</p>
      <p>Since his arrival in 2016, he's played over 160 times for the Scottish champions netting 62 times.</p>
      <p>He was the subject of English Championship interest on deadline day in the summer, but ended up staying at Parkhead.</p>
