        <b>Coronation Street legend Beverley Callard has confirmed her decision to quit the soap after 30 years in the role of Liz McDonald, with show bosses promising that she will ‘exit with a bang’. An icon of Weatherfield, Liz has been central to some huge storylines in the show, not least of all her explosive marriage to husband Jim.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Having spent many a year behind the bar of the Rovers, she has been a staple of the show for decades – but now Beverley is calling time and has shared her excitement at a gripping final storyline for the character.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.ok.co.uk/celebrity-news/beverly-callard-leaves-coronation-street-20890424">Speaking to OK Magazine</a>, she said of her decision: ‘I was in shock, I felt totally numb. I’ve been told that Liz is going to go with one hell of a bang! I can’t wait!’</p>
      <p>The actress admitted that she had had many sleepless nights before she announced her decision to show bosses earlier this year. Her final storyline will air next year and <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/25/who-is-leaving-eastenders-coronation-street-emmerdale-and-all-of-the-soaps-in-2019-10823794/">comes amid upcoming exits for Kym Marsh (Michelle Connor), Tristan Gemmill (Robert Preston) and </a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/lucy-fallon/">Lucy Fallon</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/25/who-is-leaving-eastenders-coronation-street-emmerdale-and-all-of-the-soaps-in-2019-10823794/"> (</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/bethany-platt/">Bethany Platt</a><a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/10/25/who-is-leaving-eastenders-coronation-street-emmerdale-and-all-of-the-soaps-in-2019-10823794/">).</a></p>

      <p>While discussing her decision, Bev praised Coronation Street for providing roles for older women, something she says is seriously lacking elsewhere in the industry.</p>

      <p>She said: ‘There’s very little work in our industry for women over 50, but I’m 62 and recently I was doing three jobs at once. It made me realise how I was privileged to have the opportunity to do so when so many women my age no longer get the chance.’</p>

      <p>She will soon tour with Thunder Girls, alongside Emmerdale’s Sandra Marvin, and added: ‘I’m sick of ageism in the industry. Although I’ve had to leave the safety net of being in Coronation Street to do this, I’m hoping that ageist bosses, of which there are many, take note of how successful this show is and it starts the ball rolling on helping other women my age, get the roles they still deserve.’</p>
      <p>It has yet to be confirmed whether the door will be left open for Liz to return.</p>
