      <h1>Horner: 2019 Brazilian GP was "redemption for Max" after crash 12 months ago</h1>

        <b>12 months ago, Esteban Ocon collided with race-leader <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/max-verstappen">Max Verstappen</a>. This time around the Dutchman completed the job to climb the top step of the podium for the third time in 2019. <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/red-bull-racing">Aston Martin Red Bull Racing</a> described the feat as "redemption" following the troubles last year. </b>
      </p>
      <p><i>“That was redemption for Max. We went into the race with one objective today and that was to win. From the moment the lights went out, Max stormed into the lead and controlled the race brilliantly,"</i> Horner said. </p>
      <p>Despite starting from pole and spending much of the race in P1, Verstappen had to work for his victory. He was forced to overtake <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lewis-hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a> twice and had to survive two safety car restarts at the end of the race. Horner describes the reasoning behind the pitstops and thanks his pit crew for yet another world record pit-stop. </p>

      <p><i>"Lewis pitted just before us and committed to a two-stop, then an unsafe release with the Williams cost Max the lead, but taking full advantage of his new tyres he immediately repassed Lewis. Thereafter Max controlled the race and the mechanics did a phenomenal job to turn the car around in 1.9s at the final pit stop,"</i> Horner added. </p>
      <p>
        <i>"When the Safety Car came out we had the horrible decision of whether to pit from the lead, knowing the car behind would stay out. Our strategist Hannah made the recommendation to pit so we did and Max was once again able to repass Lewis."</i>

      <p>It looked like Red Bull Racing would pick up their first one-two since 2016, but it wasn't to be when <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/alexander-albon">Alex Albon</a> collided with Hamilton. However, the result didn't change for Honda as <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/pierre-gasly">Pierre Gasly</a> took over second place in his Honda-powered<a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/scuderia-toro-rosso"> Toro Rosso</a>. Horner left some time at the end of his report to congratulate Honda and his former driver Gasly. </p>
      <p><i>"Finally, congratulations to Pierre who delivered a very strong weekend and it’s great to see him on the podium for the first time. Overall, it’s been a really positive weekend for both Red Bull teams and Honda,"</i> Horner concluded. </p>
