      <p><i><a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/tv/a29761782/katie-morton-chris-bukowski-breakup-rumors-bachelor-in-paradise/">Bachelor in Paradise</a></i> is long gone but <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a29252525/hannah-godwin-personality-cut-from-bachelor-in-paradise/">Hannah Godwin and Dylan Barbour’s</a> relationship is still going strong, which is way, way more than you can say about the other couples who left Paradise together. Naturally, since Hannah and Dylan have made it this long without any breakup rumors, people are wondering when they’re getting married.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/bips-hannah-g-dylan-arent-wedding-planning-or-living-together-yet/">Talking to </a><i><a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/bips-hannah-g-dylan-arent-wedding-planning-or-living-together-yet/">Us Weekly</a></i>, the happily engaged couple said they’re nowhere near ready to exchange their wedding vows. Dylan explained, “We talk loosely about it. It’s fun to talk about, but we haven’t set anything.”</p>
      <p>And while Hannah agreed that talking about a wedding is better than planning one, she said she has started shopping for wedding gowns. She shared, “I’ve been looking around but I’m not making any specific choices right now. I know I want it to be a surprise for him.”</p>
      <p>As for what look she’s going for, the model/influencer/<a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/tv/a29772055/hannah-godwin-instagram-how-to-pronounce-gnocchi-pasta-bachelor/">gnocchi chef</a> isn’t concerned with keeping up with the latest bridal trends and will decide based on the vibe she gets from the dress. She explained, “I think for me, I love fashion but a big part of fashion for me is how I feel in it, so whichever one I get all the emotional feels in, that’s what I’ll go for—not the trendiest one or whatever I think looks coolest on the model in the picture. I think I’m going to go for what makes me feel feminine and bridal and myself.”</p>

      <p>While their wedding plans aren’t set in stone yet, in a separate interview with <i><a href="https://www.eonline.com/news/1094182/bachelor-in-paradise-s-hannah-godwin-and-dylan-barbour-plan-to-have-a-super-small-wedding">E! News</a></i>, Hannah said that they do, however, have an engagement party in the works. But again, they don’t have very many details to share right now.</p>
      <p>And if you were hoping that this would be televised, I regret to inform you they’re keeping this event private. Hannah said, “We want it to be private and the most raw version of us and I like things and certain parts of ourselves being broadcast, we love sharing those moments. But for something so big...we want it to be family and friends.”</p>
      <p>So I guess just keep an eye on their Instagrams!</p>
