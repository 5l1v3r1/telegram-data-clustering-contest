      <h1>Metronomy return to their 'spiritual home' to play Rock City</h1>
      <h2>Nottingham is also the birthplace of keyboardist Oscar Cash</h2>

      <p>I wasn’t sure which way Metronomy would go tonight. Their new album, as fantastic as it is, has just as many ambient soundscapes and experimental doodles as perfect electro-pop songs. Would they stick to the bangers or risk confusion on the dancefloor?</p>
      <p>As it turned out, they played some of the less ‘live friendly’ tracks through the PA before they came on stage.</p>
      <p>Clever that.</p>
      <p>They open with Lately from the new record followed by The Bay from their 2011 breakthrough album The English Riviera, a magnificent pair that could easily have been their encore.</p>
      <p>This is a band that knows they have quality in depth.</p>
      <p>Half way through the hour and a half set they have an instrumental interlude, involving a coming together of keyboards in a Kraftwerk-style tableau, then return for a beautifully stripped back version of Aquarius and have the confidence to slow things down with the funny and touching acoustic Upset My Girlfriend.</p>
      <p>And they look as stylish as they sound, visions in white jumpsuits, clearly enjoying delivering old favourites like The Look alongside the irresistible Salted Caramel Ice Cream.</p>
      <p>If they ever release a greatest hits album (is that still a thing?) it really would be the definition of all killer, no filler, though that sounds far too crass for this quintessentially British band – polite, wildly creative and a delicious mix of genders, ethnicities and sexualities.</p>
      <p>Makes you proud.</p>
      <p>“Nottingham is our spiritual home,” says singer Joseph Mount, explaining his parents met in our city and it’s the birthplace of keyboardist Oscar Cash. “We’ll be visiting you again soon.”</p>
      <p>Promises, promises.</p>
