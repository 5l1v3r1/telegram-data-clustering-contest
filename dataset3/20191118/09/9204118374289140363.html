      <h1>Axens and CORYS enter into a joint collaboration for digital solutions for process industries</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T09:32:50+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 09:32</time> by <a rel="author">Gerald Ondrey</a></address>
      <p>Axens (Rueil Malmaison, France; <a href="http://www.axens.net/">www.axens.net</a>) and CORYS (Grenoble, France; <a href="http://www.corys.com/">www.corys.com</a>) have entered into a global exclusive collaboration agreement to develop and commercialize advanced simulation and training solutions for Axens process technologies based on CORYS’ INDISS PLUS dynamic simulation software.</p>
      <p>The CORYS INDISS PLUS dynamic simulator gives access to CORYS in-house high-fidelity models. The dynamic simulator provides an accurate representation of the dynamic behavior of Axens process units for training, troubleshooting, and transient operations support during start-up, shutdown, and unexpected operations.</p>
      <p>This framework agreement formalizes a successful and close business relationship between the two companies since many years.</p>
      <p>Axens’ exclusive cooperation with CORYS, a leading OTS software supplier, consolidates Axens’ refining and petrochemical expertise and CORYS’ know-how in dynamic simulation and software development into one software suite. This strategic cooperation provides Axens’ refining and petrochemical licensees access to proprietary kinetic reactor models, training scenarios, and services</p>
