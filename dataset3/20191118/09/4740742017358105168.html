      <h1>Alan Sugar criticises The Apprentice contestant Lewis Ellis over 'horrific' tattoos</h1>
      <h2>But Lewis has hit back and now viewers are convinced he is not the winner of this year's show</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T09:09:47+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 09:09</time> by <a rel="author">Jessica Sansome, Jasper King</a></address>
      <p>Lord Sugar has entered into a social media Twitter spat with one of The Apprentice's candidates over the choice of his tattoo's.</p>
      <p>It all started last Wednesday (November 13) during the show when he called Lewis Ellis' chest tattoos 'horrific' on Twitter as he watched the BBC show live, the <a href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/tv/apprentices-alan-sugar-twitter-spat-17268163">Manchester Evening News</a> reports.</p>
      <p>Last weeks' episode featured The Apprentice contestants trying to sell a summer holiday to Finland by creating an advertising campaign.</p>
      <p>Lewis, who is a digital marketer from Manchester, featured in his group's ad campaign, which saw him strip his shirt off, showcasing his tattooed arms and chest.</p>
      <p>However, Lord Sugar expressed his extreme distaste to his potential business partners body art tweeting: "Lewis your tattoos are horrific. Tell me where I am missing the point. What does he look like?"</p>

      <p>It didn't take Lewis long to respond.</p>
      <p>He tweeted, "Wow LAS how could you do me like this @Lord_Sugar."</p>

      <p>Lewis then went on to tweet about the importance of body positivity and tweeted a picture of himself.</p>
      <p>He tweeted back: "Back to rule #1 f*** what people think about you!</p>
      <p>"Thank you to everyone that took the time to show some support for my 'horrific' tattoos and pointing out no one has the right to judge you or your body."</p>

      <p>However, Lord Sugar did not take too kindly to this message, telling Lewis he will be "an embarrassment" to his future children.</p>
      <p>The Apprentice boss said: "Lewis your tattoos tell your story. What are you a kindle.</p>
      <p>"You have the right to do what you want with your body. I have the right of an opinion. I say they are horrible.</p>
      <p>"When you're 50 on the beach you'll wear a T shirt. You will be an embarrassment to your kids."</p>
      <p>Apprentice fans believe their exchange has revealed a crucial series spoiler.</p>
      <p>One replied: "I take it Lewis doesn't win then."</p>
      <p>Another joked: "Brb, just off to put a bet on Lewis winning."</p>
      <p>Lord Sugar's aide Claude Littner came under fire for his own tweeting.</p>
      <p>The 70-year-old was scolded on Twitter after sparking a flurry of furious responses to a suggestion that struggling nurses should work more.</p>
      <p>He said that if nurses "could not make ends meet" why do they not 'extend their hours' or 'find part time work'.</p>
