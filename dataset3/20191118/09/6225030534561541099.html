      <p><b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/horse/Chance_It">Chance It</a></b>, a speedy Florida-bred colt who went 2-for-3 in Gulfstream Park’s Florida Sire series, will see his shift to the <b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/p/c/Kentucky_Derby_2020_Contenders">2020 Kentucky Derby</a></b> trail pushed back a couple of weeks.</p>
      <p>Owner Shooting Star Thoroughbreds announced that the son of Currency Swap will miss Churchill Downs’ Nov. 30 Kentucky Jockey Club Stakes (G2) having come down with “a slight temperature.” The new target is the Dec. 15 <b><a href="https://www.horseracingnation.com/race/2019_Remington_Springboard_Mile">Springboard Mile</a></b> at Remington Park.</p>
      <p>Both races run around two turns and award Derby qualifying points on a 10-4-2-1 basis to the Top 4 finishers.</p>
      <p>Chance It registered three straight 91 Beyer Speed Figures — the sixth-best number for the current 2-year-old cop — heading into his most-recent start. The Saffie Joseph Jr. then passed a major test when winning over a route of ground in the Florida Sire In Reality Stakes.</p>
      <p>In the In Reality, he distanced to beat Smash Factor by 7 1/4 lengths. Liam’s Lucky Charm hit the wire 10 3/4 lengths behind one race after upsetting Chance It with a head in going seven furlongs in the Florida Sire Affirmed Stakes.</p>
      <p>“There was pressure because he got beat last time and I know how good he is,” Joseph Jr. said afterward. “You want to prove it. It was special to see him win. There was a lot of pressure and he delivered.</p>
      <p>“Visually, he did it the way you’d want him to do it. He was near the lead and on the bridle and when he asked him to go, he ran away. He put his ears up, like there’s more there.”</p>
      <p>Chance It has made all five of his starts at Gulfstream, where he hasn’t finished outside of the exacta. In the Springboard Mile he’s likely to meet, among others, last out stakes winners from the Steve Asmussen barn in Rowdy Yates and Jungle Runner. Asmussen took the 2018 Springboard Mile with eventual graded winner Long Range Toddy.</p>
