      <p>In-The-News is a roundup of stories from The Canadian Press designed to kickstart your day. Here is what's on the radar of our editors for the morning of Nov. 18.</p>

      <p>The Weather Network has released its winter forecast, and it's not great, unless you like your winter on hard side.</p>
      <p>Chief meteorgolist Chris Scott says the season will be long, cold and messy across much of Canada.</p>
      <p>He says the early start to winter in southern Ontario has set a bit of a trend across the country — except in B-C, that is.</p>
      <p>On the West Coast, it'll be a little warmer than usual with a little less precipitation, but in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, it will be frigid.</p>
      <p>The same is true for Ontario and Quebec, where Scott says winter weather will continue into late March or early April.</p>
      <p>Scott says it won't be bitterly cold in Atlantic Canada, but it will be a very stormy season.</p>
      <p>He says there will likely be lots of snow in New Brunswick and P-E-I, while in Nova Scotia it wilt be a mix of snow, ice and rain.</p>
      <p>Snowfall in Newfoundland and Labrador will be right around the average.</p>

      <p>OTTAWA — Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will be meeting in Ottawa today meets with the king of Jordan.</p>
      <p>It is King Abdullah II's fifth visit to Canada in his twenty years on the throne of the Middle Eastern country.</p>
      <p>The Prime Minister's Office says the two will discuss the partnership between Canada and Jordan and efforts to promote diversity and counter violent extremism.</p>
      <p>They'll also discuss ongoing regional security concerns, exacerbated in recent weeks by the repeated violation of a ceasefire in the Syrian civil war.</p>
      <p>Upwards of 660,000 Syrians have sought shelter from the conflict in neighbouring Jordan, and thousands of them have since been resettled to Canada under a marquee Liberal program that originated in a campaign promise during the 2015 election.</p>
      <p>That year, Trudeau promised to bring 25,000 Syrians to Canada and it is four years ago this month in Jordan that the Liberal government kicked off a multi-billion-dollar program that would eventually see nearly 40,000 Syrians arrive.</p>

      <p>TORONTO — Canada's literary cognoscenti is getting ready to walk the red carpet at tonight's Scotiabank Giller Prize gala.</p>
      <p>A mix of familiar names and newcomers are in the running for the $100,000 honour to be awarded at a ceremony at the Four Seasons Hotel Toronto.</p>
      <p>Newfoundland chronicler Michael Crummey is hoping to clinch a win for "The Innocents" after receiving nods from the Writers' Trust and Governor General's Literary Awards this season.</p>
      <p>Latvian-Canadian writer and filmmaker David Bezmozgis will have his third shot at the Giller with the short-story collection "Immigrant City." Another returning nominee is Montreal-raised Alix Ohlin with "Dual Citizens."</p>
      <p>Victoria-based Steven Price made the final cut for the first time for "Lampedusa," while Vancouver-based Ian Williams vying for the prize with his debut novel "Reproduction."</p>
      <p>And fellow first-time novelist Megan Gail Coles, raised in Savage Cove on Newfoundland's Great Northern Peninsula, rounds out the short list with "Small Game Hunting at the Local Coward Gun Club."</p>

      <p>WASHINGTON — Impeachment hearings are entering a crucial second week as Democrats are set to hear from eight witnesses about U.S. President Donald Trump’s dealings with Ukraine.</p>
      <p>Three State Department officials have already testified about their concerns as Trump pushed Ukraine to investigate Democrats and withheld military aid.</p>
      <p>In an interview aired on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Trump would be welcome to appear before investigators or answer questions in writing.</p>
      <p>Trump has said the impeachment process is stacked against him and is nothing more than a “witch hunt.”</p>
      <p>The week’s most anticipated witness may be Ambassador Gordon Sondland, who is set to appear on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Sondland spoke multiple times to Trump about Ukraine policy, and other witnesses have said the two discussed efforts to push for the investigations of Democrats.</p>

      <p>Hu wrote on his Weibo social media account: “If the rioters are killed, the police should not have to bear legal responsibility.”</p>
      <p>Hu is an outspoken commentator who leads the Global Times, a tabloid under the People’s Daily, the official paper of the ruling Communist Party.</p>
      <p>He made similar remarks on Twitter, which is banned in mainland China.</p>
