        <b><a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/lewis-hamilton">Lewis Hamilton</a> took a surprise pit-stop after the two <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/scuderia-ferrari">Ferrari</a> drivers collided. At the time, it pushed him off the podium. He fought hard to get back into the podium places, but the stewards deemed contact with <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/alexander-albon">Alex Albon</a> worthy enough of a penalty which pushed the F1 world champion back to seventh. </b>
      </p>
      <p>Without the pit-stop, Hamilton would have had a one-on-one fight with race winner <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/max-verstappen">Max Verstappen</a>. It seems as if <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/teams/mercedes-amg-f1-team">Mercedes</a> made the wrong choice but the British driver stands up for his team. </p>

      <p><i>“The team did very well with the strategy. It was not their decision at the end. It was rather an opportunity that they offered me. I thought I could take the chance and that losing a place on the track wouldn't be so bad. I could catch up on Albon again. Obviously, that was not how things went,"</i> Hamilton told the press after the Brazilian Grand Prix. </p>
      <p>Meanwhile, his teammate <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/drivers/valtteri-bottas">Valtteri Bottas</a> recorded his first DNF since the chaotic 2019 <a href="https://www.gpblog.com/en/grandsprix/german-grand-prix">German Grand Prix</a>. It wasn't a good weekend for Mercedes who were without Toto Wolff for the first time since 2013. </p>
