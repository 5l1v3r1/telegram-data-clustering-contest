      <p>Two people were attacked and robbed at gunpoint in a car as it parked in a driveway after being followed from OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg at the weekend.</p>
      <p>Police spokesperson Brig Mathapelo Peters said an e-hailing taxi service was transporting a man from the airport to Morningside in Sandton on Sunday evening.</p>
      <p>He had reportedly arrived from the United Kingdom and was being dropped off at a hotel.</p>
      <p>“When the security opened the gate, they were attacked and robbed of their belongings,” said Peters.</p>
      <p>The gang opened the car's doors and rifled through the boot, stealing goods worth more than R100,000.</p>
      <p>The suspects fled the scene in a waiting car. No arrests were made.</p>
      <p>By 4.30pm Monday afternoon, police spokeswoman Colonel Brenda Muridili said no arrests were made. A task team was investigating the matter.</p>
