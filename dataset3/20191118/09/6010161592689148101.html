      <h1>Google ups Stadia launch line-up to 22 games</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T09:33:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 09:33</time> by <a rel="author">Sherif Saed</a></address>
      <p>Just hours from the launch of Stadia, Google has expanded the service’s launch line-up of games.</p>
      <p>Google announced that 22 games will be available for purchase to <b>Stadia</b> players at today’s launch, nearly doubling the <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/11/11/google-stadia-launch-lineup-games/">initially announced 12</a>.</p>
      <p>Google is also giving Samurai Shodown away to Stadia Pro members on day one, alongside the previously announced Destiny 2: The Collection. Stadia Pro is the only way to access the service at launch – through a Premiere or Founders Edition purchase, meaning all players will own both games at launch.</p>
      <p>The updated list includes Grid, Metro Exodus, Rage 2, Final Fantasy 15, Wolfenstein: Youngblood and other titles previously pegged for a later release. Tequila Works’ Gylt remains the platform’s sole exclusive at launch.</p>
      <p>This follows a disappointing round of Stadia news that several of its most interesting, and in some cases basic features <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2019/11/14/google-stadia-all-missing-features-at-launch/">won’t be there at launch</a>. Things like a web store, achievement UI, family sharing and more are coming at some point later.</p>
      <p>Google also revealed a couple of limitations for supported devices, and the Buddy Pass.</p>
