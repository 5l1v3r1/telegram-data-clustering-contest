      <p>UnionPay has officially announced its partnership with <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2019/10/30/boost-ewallet-unionpay-qr-merchants-malaysia/">Boost</a> and <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2019/11/01/u-mobile-gopayz-ewallet-launch-free-card-skg/">U Mobile</a> which will enable more cashless touchpoints for eWallet users in Malaysia. The UnionPay QR payment feature is now available on both Boost and GoPayz eWallet.</p>
      <h3>Boost eWallet</h3>

      <p>GoPayz, the eWallet by U Mobile went live a few weeks ago and it comes with a UnionPay virtual card for every user. By default, GoPayz users can already start making payments at UnionPay QR touchpoints by using the built-in Scan &amp; Pay feature that’s linked to the Virtual Card number.</p>
      <p>GoPayz is also looking at enabling NFC payments on the app and this will allow users to make local and international transactions via their smartphones at over 19 million UnionPay mobile contactless merchants in 38 countries and regions.</p>
      <p>As part of their current promo, GoPayz users that top up a minimum of RM30 will be able to request for a <a href="https://www.soyacincau.com/2019/11/01/u-mobile-gopayz-ewallet-launch-free-card-skg/">physical GoPayz card</a> worth RM16 for free. UPI claims that over 90% of merchants in Malaysia are now accepting UnionPay cards and the number of UnionPay cards issued in Malaysia has more than doubled in 2019. They added that mobile transactions have increased rapidly in 2019 due to wide-scale deployment of QR code terminals in the market which covers retail, airport duty-free, F&amp;B, convenience stores and more.</p>
