        <i>Dean’s photographs capture unintended poetry in rural Britain’s abandoned water towers, brickworks and wartime defences</i>
      </p>
      <p>Some of the best architecture happens when its creators are looking the other way – side elevations rather than imposing facades, kitchens and stables in great palaces, chimneys and roof trusses and other functional items. Something good happens when the anxiety to impress is removed, and an architect or builder can just get on with solving a practical problem with a degree of grace.</p>
      <p>So it is with most of the structures in <i><a href="https://www.arca-projects.com/">Slacklands 2</a></i> in which the architectural curator and teacher Corinna Dean follows up her 2014 book <i>Slacklands</i> with further images of what she calls “rural contemporary architecture of the 20th century”. Her examples are such things as the ancillary structures of dams, military installations, water towers, mine headframes. What makes them striking is that they follow logic outside the usual run of houses and farm buildings, as often as not made inscrutable by the passage of time – whatever considerations once guided them tends to be forgotten.</p>
      <p>Most of them come into the category of things that wouldn’t normally be allowed. Thus the medieval ruin of Leiston chapel in Suffolk has a 1940s concrete pillbox inserted into its fabric, a sacrilege against heritage only permissible in the emergency of war, which is nonetheless wonderful. Like a benign parasite in a large animal, the pillbox and its host set up a mutually supportive relationship. A hybrid being, more arresting than either pillbox or relic on its own, is created out of different layers of history.</p>

      <p>Most of Dean’s examples (though there is nothing in the book’s concept that says this must be so) are in varying degrees of abandonment and decay. This adds another level of unintended poetry, as with the geodesic dome of a cold war listening station in Balado, Scotland, the white fibreglass panels of which have aged to look like alabaster, or with the weeds and lichen that tend to adorn old concrete.</p>
      <p>The countryside (especially in Britain) is so fussed over, so subject to aesthetic agonies as to what is and is not appropriate, so conditioned by picturesque considerations of what it should be like, that there is something bracing and compelling about, for example, the 70m chimneys of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/mar/01/manufacturing.britishidentity">Stewartby brickworks</a> in Bedfordshire, or the serried concrete walls of the former Curtis’s and Harvey explosives factory in north Kent. Not, it should be noted, that everything is the result of purely functional, unreflective design: the butterfly-roofed pavilions that rise out of the Backwater reservoir in Angus, particularly, were part of a considered attempt to harmonise them with the landscape.</p>
      <p><i>Slacklands 2</i> has some eccentricities. The choice of subjects is governed by Dean’s ability to get to them, for which reason structures from Albania, Sri Lanka, France, Spain and Italy are, a touch arbitrarily, added to a mostly British collection. Some locations – the Venice Lido, Crystal Palace in London – are not precisely rural. While Dean’s photographs are crisp and evocative, her prose can be a bit lumpy.</p>
      <p>She has also invited the illustrator <a href="http://www.peternencini.co.uk/">Peter Nencini</a> to contribute abstract compositions of building materials that appear in between the constructions. These are handsome, and give a different perception of the subject, but I’d prefer fewer of them and more of Dean’s photographs. For it is the photographs – haunting, surprising, the outcome of a dedicated search for subjects – that make <i>Slacklands 2</i> into the arresting book it is.</p>
