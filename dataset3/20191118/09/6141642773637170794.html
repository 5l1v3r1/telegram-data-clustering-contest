      <p>The bird’s epic but ultimately tragic adventure began when it was struck by Martin Stacey’s vehicle on a road in Gloucestershire while he was on his way to the island.</p>
      <p>Despite being injured and undoubtedly mentally traumatised to find itself under a car bonnet, the plucky pigeon successfully evaded Customs officials during a border check and saw out a crossing on the Commodore Clipper.</p>
      <p>Describing the story of the unusual stowaway, Mr Stacey said: ‘I was coming down a country road travelling about 50 to 55mph and I could see this low-hanging branch in the distance.</p>
      <p>‘As I got closer I noticed a pigeon in it and as I met the branch it quite suddenly dropped out of the tree and I hit it.</p>
      <p>‘There were feathers and I thought I must have killed it.’</p>

      <p>Mr Stacey continued on to his overnight stop in Southampton before making his way to the Portsmouth ferry early the following day.</p>
      <p>‘I arrived at the terminal and Customs did a routine check on my car. I opened the boot and bonnet and explained I had hit a pigeon the day before.</p>
      <p>‘The officers shone their torch around, found nothing and sent me on my way,’ he said.</p>
      <p>‘I then had the car on the ferry for eight or so hours before arriving in Guernsey and going out for a bite to eat with family.’</p>
      <p>The next morning Mr Stacey visited his daughter and when he returned to his car he found a note on the windscreen.</p>
      <p>‘Someone had a left a note after maybe hearing or seeing the pigeon making some commotion to tell me I had a bird under my bonnet.</p>
      <p>‘Sure enough, me and my daughter could see it but couldn’t see a way out for it either.’</p>
      <p>They took the car to a garage and staff managed to free the bird.</p>
      <p>‘I was very surprised it hadn’t been cut to pieces coming through the plastic grill, which was partly smashed,’ added Mr Stacey.</p>
      <p>The bird showed no desire to fly away and staff from the GSPCA were called.</p>
      <p>Although the persevering pigeon survived the 150-mile ordeal without food or water for nearly two days, it was left badly shaken by the incident, and a vet decided the best course of action was to put the bird down.</p>
