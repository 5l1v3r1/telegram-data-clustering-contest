        <b>A Fine Gael by-election candidate has apologised for her "very poor choice of words" when speaking about asylum seekers and direct provision.</b>
      </p>
      <p>Verona Murphy is contesting this month's by-election in Wexford.</p>
      <p><b><a href="https://www.rte.ie/news/politics/2019/1117/1092465-by-election/">In an interview with <i>RTÉ</i> over the weekend</a></b>, the businesswoman said there were issues with the direct provision system.</p>
      <p>She suggested that people <b><a href="https://www.newstalk.com/news/oughterard-hotel-withdraws-direct-provision-process-protests-910044">protesting about a proposed centre</a></b> in Oughterard, Co Galway were "absolutely justified because they hadn't been given enough information".</p>
      <p>She argued: "These people are coming from such war-torn countries that they have to be deprogrammed, for the want of a better word, but through support services.</p>
      <p>"They carry angst that you wouldn't ordinarily see, possibly infiltrated by ISIS and we have to protect ourselves against that."</p>
      <p>The comments drew criticism, including from the Irish Refugee Council:</p>

      <p>In a statement issued by Fine Gael, Ms Murphy apologised for the comments.</p>
      <p>She said: “This was a very poor choice of words and I am very sorry to anyone who was offended by them.</p>
      <blockquote>“People coming here fleeing persecution deserve to be treated with compassion and respect.</blockquote>
      <p>"They need to be given opportunities to forge a new start for themselves and their families.</p>
      <p>"That is why we have direct provision: to provide board and lodging to people seeking asylum."</p>
      <p>She added: “The point I was trying to make was that some people coming to this country do so from very difficult circumstances and the support services they need here have a vital role in helping them.”</p>
      <p>A spokesperson for Fine Gael added that immigration "enriches our country socially, culturally and economically".</p>
      <p>They suggested that 'some form of incentive' is currently being considered to encourage parties to run more candidates from ethnic minorities.</p>
