      <p>It’s only been a few weeks since Eva Marcille welcomed her baby boy, Maverick and she looks as great as ever! The Real Housewives of Atlanta star is definitely not struggling to lose any pregnancy weight!</p>
      <p>The whole latest season of the show documented her third pregnancy since she was already a mother of two and it’s safe to say that she glowed the entire time!</p>
      <p>Now that the bundle of joy is here, Eva is looking forward to the day she can return to the gym so that she can once again focus on her fitness.</p>
      <p>While at BravoCon, she chatted with HollywoodLife, telling the site about her weight gain and plans to work out as soon as she is allowed to.</p>
      <p>‘I think in the end it was like 40 something [pounds]. First day of BravoCon started my five weeks and it takes six weeks before you even go back to the doctor or workout or do anything. So I go see [Married To Medicine’s] Dr. Jackie [Walters], my doctor. Hopefully, she clears me to work out,’ the reality TV star dished.</p>
      <p>At the end of the day, carrying and having a baby, especially all the while caring for two other young kids is not easy at all!</p>
      <p>That is the main reason why Eva is very proud of her and her body for going through it so successfully.</p>
      <p>About the weight gain, she joked that ‘I mean, hey, it was a whole baby. We are and however you do it, if it’s a C-section if is natural. I had an epidural for sure.’</p>
      <p>The celeb revealed that she is determined to go back to her pre-pregnancy body before the reunion ‘So that I can slay with like a proper side-eye and snatchedness, yes.’</p>
