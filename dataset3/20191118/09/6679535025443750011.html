      <p>CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury has strongly condemned the police action against JNU students who were marching to Parliament in protest against the recent fee hike proposed by the university administration.</p>
      <p>“This is not the way to deal with a democratic protest. The police deployment is much larger than deployment during Emergency days. This is Modi’s emergency. We strongly condemn it,” Mr Yechury said at a press conference here on Monday. He was the JNU students’ union president during the Emergency days.</p>
      <p>“Peaceful demonstration is an elementary right in a democratic society. This shows extreme authoritarianism by Modi government,” he added.</p>
      <p>He said that on many occasions during his tenure as JNUSU president, student marches had gone till Parliament gates. There was no violence. Not even a single stone was thrown, he said. “Police is in fact trying to provoke. The students have shown restraint in the face of such provocation,” he added.</p>
