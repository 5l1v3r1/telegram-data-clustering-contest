      <p>A scuffle broke out between former <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/geordie-shore">Geordie Shore</a> stars Sam Gowland and Marty McKenna at a press conference ahead of their fight at a as part of a celebrity MMA event.</p>
      <p>The reality stars will go head-to-head on Saturday, December 14 at the Utilita Arena.</p>
      <p>But fans almost didn't have to wait that long as the pair squared up to each other at a press conference at Northumbria University Students Union on Sunday night.</p>
      <p>Security stepped in to separate the two lads, as Marty continued to throw water and a chair at his opponent.</p>
      <p>The fight will hold extra significance, as both are ex-boyfriends of Chloe Ferry - Marty isn't a huge fan of ex-Love Islander Sam either, who only split from Chloe a few months ago.</p>
      <p>But Marty told the press conference: "I just want to get it across that it's not about Chloe. It couldn't be further from Chloe.</p>
      <p>"The opportunity arose to me. I was getting 20 grand for this straightener. Why wouldn't I take it?"</p>
      <p>Host Charlie Sloth said: "It feels like there's some tension around that situation though."</p>
      <p>Marty replied: "We're going for a fight with each other, in a cage, we're not going to be nice to each other."</p>
      <p>He added: "I have got respect for the kid because we're going into a cage to have a straightener but at the end of the day we're going in there to f****** destroy each other.</p>
      <p>"After the fight we'll shake hands. We'll have a straighterner, we'll get it over with, and we'll be pals afterwards.</p>
      <p>Marty had previously posted "I’m coming for that win, can’t wait to smash up this opponent. It’s been a long time coming," before adding "This is a fight I’ve been wanting to have for a long time. I have so much motivation. December 14th it’s going down in my city Newcastle and he won’t be welcome back after. Come and see me smash this muppet on  <a href="https://www.instagram.com/famemmauk/">@famemmauk</a> ."</p>
      <p>The night will be headlined by  <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/sam-gowland-marty-mckenna-fight-17157928">Scotty T and Stephen Bear.</a></p>
