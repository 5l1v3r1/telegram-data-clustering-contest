      <h2>Rennes midfielder Eduardo Camavinga is on the radar of Man Utd, Barcelona, Real Madrid, Man City, Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund and Atletico Madrid</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T09:39:13+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 09:39</time> by <a rel="author">Alex Smith</a></address>
      <p>Rennes president Olivier Letang has revealed that he is preparing for talks with in demand star Eduardo Camavinga at the end of the season.</p>
      <p>Angolan-born Frenchman Camavinga has been linked with a move to <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-united-fc">Manchester United</a> - with a £26million price tag stuck on him.</p>
      <p>Camavinga only turned 17 earlier this month but is seen as one of Europe's hottest properties - with <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/fc-barcelona">Barcelona</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/real-madrid-cf">Real Madrid</a> , <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/manchester-city-fc">Manchester City</a> , Bayern Munich, Borussia Dortmund and Atletico Madrid also tracking the teenager.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/tottenham-hotspur-fc">Tottenham</a>  and  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/arsenal-fc">Arsenal</a>  also had  <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsenal-tottenham-failed-bids-rennes-18999588">bids turned down</a> , according to L'Equipe, which would have seen him return to Rennes on a two-year loan.</p>

      <p>But Letang has admitted that the French club will find it difficult to keep hold of Camavinga in the long term despite being desperate to hold him for more than a decade.</p>
      <p>“If it only depended on me, I would like to keep him for another 10 years. Aside from that, there are approaches, a market and the desires of the player.</p>
      <p>"We will meet to discuss it a little later on. Probably at the end of the season."</p>

      <p>Camavinga is a highly rated defensive midfielder who became the youngest ever assist maker when he setup a goal against Paris Saint-Germain earlier this season.</p>
      <p>Rennes boss Julien Stephan said of Camavinga's performance against PSG back in August: "He played a very interesting match, indeed, like the whole team.</p>
      <p>"We are talking to him. He is someone who is also very intellectually gifted, who knows how to question himself, who knows how to ask the right questions."</p>
      <p>Camavinga, who currently plays in the French Under 21 side, was born in Angola and moved to France aged two and so can represent either country, as well as the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
