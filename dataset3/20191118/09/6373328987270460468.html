      <p>The 70-year-old writer and socialite made the shocking claims during a discussion about convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein who had hired underage girls for sex work.</p>
      <p>Causing host Piers Morgan to react with outrage, Lady Campbell appeared to suggest there was a difference between paedophilia and soliciting underage girls for sex work.</p>

        <b>Speaking on the subject of Epstein and his convictions, Lady Campbell said:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>You all seem to have forgotten that Jeffrey Epstein, the offence for which he was charged and for which he was imprisoned, was for soliciting prostitution from minors.<br/><br/>That is not the same thing as paedophilia.</blockquote>
      <p>A visibly horrified Piers Morgan then asked Lady Campbell what she would describe it as, to which she simply responded, ‘prostitution’.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Piers replied:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Advertisements</p>
      <blockquote>If you solicited a 14-year-old for prostitution, you’re a paedophile.</blockquote>

      <p>It was at this point that Lady Campbell said, ‘It doesn’t matter,’ sparking further anger.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Morgan exploded:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>It does matter. You’re procuring an underage girl for sex! That’s what he was convicted of! I’m sorry, I’m sorry, with respect, that is nonsense.</blockquote>
      <p>
        <b>Lady Campbell then went on to claim there was a difference between a child and a minor, causing outrage amongst viewers, responding:</b>
      </p>
      <p>Advertisements</p>
      <blockquote>Was he? 14? Well, I’m not justifying Jeffrey Epstein, Paedophilia, I suspect there’s a difference between a minor and a child.</blockquote>

      <p>
        <b>One viewer said:</b>
      </p>
      <blockquote>A 14 year old is not a child? I wonder what her reaction would have been if the 14 year old had been a member of her family? Also it’s never paedophilia, it’s child sexual abuse.</blockquote>

        <b>Another commented:</b>

      <blockquote>#LadyColinCampbell can’t believe what’s coming out of her mouth! First person I’ve heard sticking up for #pedoprince hang your head in shame!!</blockquote>
