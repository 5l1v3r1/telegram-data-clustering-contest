      <p>Cape Town - <b>Heyneke Meyer </b>quit as <b>Stade Francais</b> coach because his relationship with the players broke down.</p>
      <p>According to Afrikaans newspaper <b><a href="https://www.netwerk24.com/Sport/Rugby/so-is-heyneke-gelem-20191116">Rapport</a></b>, sources close to the former Springbok coach said he felt "stripped of his humanity" because of the soured relationship with the players.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/Rugby/heyneke-meyer-stade-francais-part-ways-20191112">Meyer quit as Stade coach last week</a> after the Paris-based club lost seven of their opening nine matches to sit bottom of the French Top 14 standings.</p>
      <p>Just the week before, Stade's billionaire owner <b>Hans-Peter Wild</b> gave his full support for Meyer.</p>
      <p>In an interview with French sports daily <b><a href="https://www.lequipe.fr/Rugby/Article/Hans-peter-wild-proprietaire-et-president-du-stade-francais-les-joueurs-n-ont-plus-d-excuse/1080561">Lequipe</a></b>, Wild said he did not regret appointing Meyer as head coach last year.</p>
      <p>"Heyneke realised he couldn't succeed at Stade Francais. He assured me that, thanked me and said: 'My staff and I are facing a wall. Communication with the players has broken down'.</p>
      <p>"Heyneke instructed the players to play a certain game plan against Racing, but the players did not respect it. They did the opposite," Wild said after of <a href="https://www.sport24.co.za/Rugby/terrific-thomas-claims-racing-bragging-rights-over-struggling-stade-francais-20191110">25-9 home loss to Racing 92</a>.</p>
      <p>Wild added that the Stade players were not fit for top-level rugby.</p>
      <p>Meyer's assistants - ex-France prop Pieter de Villiers, South Africans Dewald Senekal, Ricardo Loubscher and English defence coach John McFarland - have also left the club.</p>
