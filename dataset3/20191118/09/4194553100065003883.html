      <h1>Xabi Alonso’s words on Fabinho perfectly sum up his world-class ability</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T09:08:45+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 09:08</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.empireofthekop.com/author/mattaddison/" target="_blank">Matt Addison</a></address>
      <p>Former Liverpool, Real Madrid and Spain midfielder Xabi Alonso has heaped praise onto Reds number three Fabinho, who has been in exceptional form this season.</p>
      <p>There is an argument that the holding midfielder, who scored a sensational goal to open the scoring against Manchester City, has been the Reds’ best player so far this year.</p>
      <p>Alonso told <a href="https://athletique.com/1355420/2019/11/16/xabi-alonso-exclusive-i-dont-want-to-be-known-for-what-i-have-done-i-want-to-be-known-for-what-i-am-doing/">The Athletic</a> in a rare interview: <b>“He is connected to the game, always. His anticipation is his greatest asset.</b></p>
      <p>
        <b>“Sometimes you only have to take one or two steps to change the movements of your teammates and that can determine the whole outcome of the game without anyone really realising because spectators tend to follow the ball rather than the player.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>“He’s not reacting one second later, he’s anticipating what is going to happen one second before.”</b>
      </p>
      <p>Fabinho is criminally overlooked by his country, Brazil, where Real Madrid’s Casemiro often plays ahead of him, but that is to the Reds’ advantage, as it keeps him fresh.</p>
      <p>Having Fabinho fit and on fire over the next few months will be crucial to progressing in the Champions League and maintaining their place at the summit of the Premier League table.</p>
      <p>Jurgen Klopp has made some truly incredible acquisitions over the last few years, but the Brazilian has to be right up there among the very best in terms of value for money and what he brings to the table – he’s now one of the first names on the team-sheet.</p>
