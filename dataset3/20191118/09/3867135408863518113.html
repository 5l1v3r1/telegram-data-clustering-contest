        <b>Risks of vaping</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Mukilteo Police Department is hosting a community forum Tuesday about the risks of vaping. Health educator Mary O’Leary, of the Snohomish County Health District, is the speaker.</p>
      <p>The subject has been in the spotlight recently, with <a href="https://www.heraldnet.com/news/second-case-of-vaping-related-lung-injury-reported-in-county/">two reported cases</a> of people becoming ill from vaping in Snohomish County. And in October, Gov. Jay Inslee issued an executive order to have flavored vape products banned.</p>
      <p>“It is important that teens and community members learn factual information about vaping and e-cigarettes so responsible health-related decisions can be made. Too many times these devices can encourage the use of more dangerous substances,” said Mukilteo Police Chief Cheol Kang.</p>

        <b>Meet an astronaut</b>
      </p>
      <p>South Korea’s first and only astronaut will share her story at Stanwood High School on Saturday.</p>
      <p>Yi So-yeon left Earth in 2008 to spend nine days at the International Space Station, where she conducted experiments and medical tests for the Korea Aerospace Research Institute.</p>
      <p>She almost died on her way back, when her spacecraft’s equipment went awry. She and two other astronauts experienced nearly 16Gs of force and a rough landing 260 miles from their intended destination.</p>
      <p>Yi left the South Korean space program in 2014, and had a stint as a physics teacher at Everett Community College in 2016. She now lives in Puyallup.</p>
      <p>A limited number of free tickets are available at Sno-Isle Libraries branches in Stanwood, Camano Island, Lakewood/Smokey Point and Arlington.</p>
      <p>The event will take place from 4 to 6 p.m. Saturday at the Stanwood High School Performing Arts Center, 7400 272nd St. NW, Stanwood. Doors open at 3 p.m.</p>
