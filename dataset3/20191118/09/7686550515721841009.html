      <h1>Ross Moriarty being chased by host of English and French clubs targeting deal that would end Wales career</h1>
      <h2>Moriarty is being linked with a host of clubs but would have to give up his Wales career as things stand</h2>

      <p>Exeter Chiefs are among a host of English and French clubs attempting to lure Ross Moriarty away from the Dragons in the summer, according to reports.</p>
      <p>The 25-year-old is coming to the end of his two-year deal with the Welsh region having joined for the start of the 2018-19 season from Gloucester.</p>
      <p>The abrasive back-rower, who helped Wales finish fourth in the Rugby World Cup this month, spent six seasons at Kingsholm and <a href="https://www.therugbypaper.co.uk/">The Rugby Paper report their</a> west country Gallagher Premiership rivals Exeter are heading the queue for his signature next term.</p>
      <p>Any move back to English rugby would mean an end to Moriarty's Test career as the St Helens-born star has only accrued 41 caps, since his debut against Ireland in the 2015 Rugby World Cup warm-up clash with Ireland in Cardiff.</p>
      <p>That leaves him 19 short of the 60-cap threshold set by the WRU for international players plying their trade outside of this country.</p>
      <p>The policy is currently being reviewed, with <a href="https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-news/rugby-morning-headlines-wales-60-17272225">players to be consulted over it.</a> It would be a big surprise if Moriarty was prepared to put his international career in jeopardy, and he is likely to interest the other three Welsh regions if he does opt to depart the Dragons.</p>
      <p>The Paper report Exeter boss Rob Baxter was keen on securing the services of Moriarty when his Gloucester contract was up in the summer of 2018 and has already sounded out the player on his future plans.</p>
      <p>Exeter, who have Welsh internationals Tomas Francis and Alex Cuthbert among their Sandy Park squad, have also reportedly made a play to add Toulon-based scrum-half Rhys Webb to their playing ranks in the summer.</p>
      <p>Northampton Saints were also reportedly interested in Moriarty two years ago and were ready to offer him a bumper offer to move to Franklin's Gardens.</p>
      <p>And with Saints coach Chris Boyd putting a big ball-carrier top of his shopping list, the east Midlands outfit are thought to be keen to renew their interest in Moriarty.</p>
      <p>Toulon, who are also thought to be keen on signing Wales and Lions full-back Liam Williams for next season, are among a clutch of French clubs monitoring the Moriarty situation.</p>
      <p>They too could face a fight if Moriarty decides his future lies in French fields Lyon and Montpellier among the other clubs reportedly showing an interest.</p>
