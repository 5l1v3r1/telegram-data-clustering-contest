      <h1>Worldwide public cloud revenue to grow 17% in 2020: Gartner</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T09:31:56+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 09:31</time> by <a rel="author">PTI</a></address>
      <p>The worldwide public cloud services market is forecast to grow 17 per cent in 2020 to total $266.4 billion, up from $227.8 billion in the previous calendar year, according to Gartner, Inc.</p>
      <p>“At this point, cloud adoption is mainstream,” Sid Nag, research Vice-President at Gartner, said in a statement.</p>
      <p>“The expectations of the outcomes associated with cloud investments therefore are also higher. Adoption of next-generation solutions are almost always ‘cloud-enhanced’ solutions, meaning they build on the strengths of a cloud platform to deliver digital business capabilities,” he said.</p>
      <h3>SaaS</h3>
      <p>Software as a service (SaaS) will remain the largest market segment, which is forecast to grow to $116 billion next year due to the scalability of subscription-based software, the research firm said.</p>
      <p>The second-largest market segment is cloud system infrastructure services, or infrastructure as a service (IaaS), which will reach $50 billion in 2020.</p>
      <p>IaaS is forecast to grow 24 per cent year over year, which is the highest growth rate across all market segments.</p>
      <p>This growth is attributed to the demands of modern applications and workloads which require infrastructure that traditional data centres cannot meet, Gartner said in the statement.</p>
