      <h1>Danny Mills discusses whether Leeds star Kalvin Phillips should be in the England squad</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T09:45:28+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 09:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://tbrfootball.com/author/will-butcher/" target="_blank">Will Butcher</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://talksport.com/topic/sports-breakfast/">Danny Mills has told Alan Brazil’s Sports Breakfast Show on TalkSPORT</a> (Monday, 7:13am) that Kalvin Phillips will be on Gareth Southgate’s radar for the England squad, but reckons it is too soon for the Leeds United ace.</p>
      <p>Phillips, 23, has once again been in superb form for Leeds this season – starting all 18 league and cup matches this season and only being substituted once. Sitting at the base of the Leeds midfield, he has once again impressed many under Marcelo Bielsa.</p>
      <p>Many Leeds fans are of the opinion that Phillips should be in the England squad, especially with a lack of talent at the base of the midfield.Harry Winks impressed on Sunday night, but Declan Rice is lacking in form.</p>
      <p>Former Leeds star Mills was asked if Phillips should be in the squad and although the ex-England defender gave a glowing verdict on Phillips, he feels that without Premier League experience, it is too far a step up for the Leeds ace.</p>

      <p><span dir="auto">“I’d love it. I think he’s a fabulous player,” <a href="https://talksport.com/topic/sports-breakfast/">Mills said</a>. “But the step up to the Premier League is huge, and then the step up to international football is absolutely massive. <br/></span> <span dir="auto">“It is too much to take them from the Championship and drop them in and be fabulous. The mental pressure, everything comes with it. He’ll be on the radar without a shadow of doubt.<span dir="ltr">“<br/></span></span></p>
      <h3>TBR’s view – Should Phillips be in the England squad?</h3>
      <p>Mills makes an excellent point, but the belief that the Championship should be ignored for England selection is a myth. Phillips is already of the standard of a Premier League player – he does not need top-tier football to prove that.</p>
      <p>It is a big step up, as Mills explains and it probably too soon for Phillips. Indeed, if the midfielder was to get a chance for England, he should have been given such a chance in matches prior to the Euro 2020 warm-ups that come in March.</p>
