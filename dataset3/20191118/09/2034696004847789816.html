      </p>
      <p>A new trailer has been released for Armando Iannucci’s new space comedy, <i>Avenue 5</i>. You can watch it below.</p>
      <p>According to HBO, the show from the <i>Veep</i> and <i>Thick of It </i>creator is “a space tourism comedy set 40 years in the future when the solar system is everyone’s oyster.”</p>
      <p>The show, <a href="https://www.nme.com/news/tv/hugh-laurie-armando-iannucci-new-space-comedy-2370582">which was initially announced in August of last year</a>, is due to hit Sky Atlantic and NOWTV in January.</p>
      <p>Starring Hugh Laurie as the captain of a luxurious space ship, the trailer shows the ensuing chaos when the ship runs into trouble. Also appearing in the comedy are Josh Gad, Zach Woods, Nikki Amuka-Bird, Rebecca Front, Lenora Crichlow, Suzy Nakamura and Ethan Phillips.</p>

It’s not flying cars and stuff, it’s about what really happens when a lot of people just have to get on with each other in space.”</p>
      <p>On deciding to set the show in the future, he added: “If I look at the present, I lose my sense of humour, so I’m looking to take stories from other periods and show how the present is reflected in them.”</p>

      <p>The director also revealed that he has been influenced by Charlie Brooker’s <i><a href="https://www.nme.com/tag/black-mirror">Black Mirror</a>. </i>“I like it a lot. I try and ration my viewing of it because I don’t want to be even subliminally affected by it. It’s really well done.”</p>
      <p>“I watched the ‘Star Trek’ one recently. That was a fantastic story, really well performed and shot. I ration myself to one every few months so I’m not too depressed by its general brilliance.”</p>
      <p>Iannucci has worked with Laurie previously on <i>Veep</i> during season 4 where he had a recurring role in the award-winning series.</p>
