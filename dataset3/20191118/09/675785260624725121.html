      <h1>Liverpool's 'signing of the season' opens up on working alongside Jurgen Klopp</h1>
      <h2>Vitor Matos has made a major impression behind the scenes at Liverpool and has now opened up on his working relationship with Jurgen Klopp</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T09:23:16+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 09:23</time> by <a rel="author">Rich Jones, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/rich-jones/</a></address>
      <p>Former Porto coach Vitor Matos was recently labelled as Liverpool's "signing of the season" by assistant manager Pep Ljinders.</p>
      <p>Matos has been branded Liverpool's "connector" since being brought in as an elite development coach by Jurgen Klopp over the summer.</p>
      <p>He has largely gone under the radar to the wider world but behind the scenes his impact has clearly not gone unnoticed.</p>
      <p>In his first in-depth interview since arriving at Anfield, Matos has opened up on life working underneath German boss Klopp.</p>
      <p>“Working with Jürgen is like having a masterclass!” Matos told <a href="https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/features/373570-vitor-matos-liverpool-connector-interview">Liverpoolfc.com</a> .</p>
      <p>“I am very pleased and happy for the opportunity to work with the best. Really, Jürgen is not only about understanding football, a player or a youth player, he is more than that, it is how he understands life and its values.</p>

      <p>“For me, this fascinating way of seeing things is unbelievable, it’s really unbelievable.</p>
      <p>“Normally we say that the character of the team is the character of the coach and we can see Jürgen’s impact on everything in the club. The way he is as a person makes an influence on the training sessions, in the pre-match meetings, on the environment at Melwood.</p>
      <p>“There is a famous doctor in Portugal who says, ‘They who only know about medicine, don’t know anything about medicine’ and I say that a coach who only knows about football doesn’t know anything about football. Jürgen is the perfect example of that.</p>
      <p>“The way he fills all the game ideas, all the tactical principles, all the team organisation with passion and with love is amazing because that is what gives you the way of playing. It’s been really amazing to work with him.”</p>

      <p>Matos has also outlined exactly what his role is within the club.</p>
      <p>“My biggest goal is to create development. You can create development in different ways but the most important thing is that you understand football as a collective game,” he explained.</p>
      <p>“It’s something that is built on the interactions between the players and these interactions that you have are related to your way of playing, to your identity, so you can see: ‘OK, this is <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/liverpool-fc">Liverpool</a> ’s way of playing.’</p>
      <p>“Development or individual development is also connected with this: these game ideas and this way of playing will force the individual development of the players.</p>

      <p>“My role is to say: ‘OK, we have these Academy players. How can we help them learn the game ideas of the first team, and how can we use those game ideas to continue their individual development?’</p>
      <p>“My first idea when I arrived was that I needed to know every one of the U18 and U23 players and discuss, ‘What’s the big idea for him?’</p>
      <p>“I needed to know which person I need to speak to and work with to achieve this. It’s about knowing the club, knowing what the expectation is for a youth player to come and train here [at Melwood].”</p>
