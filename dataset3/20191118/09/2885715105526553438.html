      <p>Actor TJ Miller has said he would like Disney-Marvel to not make the third part in Ryan Reynolds-fronted Deadpool series.</p>
      <p>The future of the beloved franchise is in doldrums after Disney acquired 20th Century Fox, which produced the first two parts, both of which were R-rated.</p>
      <p>A certain section of fans fear under Marvel, owned by Disney, the content of the threequel might be sanitised so as to suit the PG-13 audience of the Mouse House.</p>
      <p>Miller, who portrays Deadpool’s confidante Weasel, recently appeared on The Adam Carolla Show, where he gave an update about the franchise’s direction.</p>
      <p>The actor said the studio is more focused on developing X-Force, a spin-off of Deadpool.</p>
      <p>“You know they don’t have — they are doing X-Force, so Deadpool, the character and Cable, I think, and some of the other characters went in there in X-Force and there are just now so many characters in that world that there wasn’t really room for me to do X-Force,” Miller said.</p>
      <p>He claimed since Disney is planning to develop X-Force, he believes it is good that they are not working on the third Deadpool film.</p>
      <p>“Because they’re doing X-Force, they haven’t decided if they want to do Deadpool 3. And to be honest, I almost would rather they didn’t.”</p>
      <p>The actor gave the example of Hangover films to support his argument.</p>
      <p>“The Hangover II was a lot of fun. The Hangover III felt like a cash grab… I think (with) Deadpool 2, we knocked it out of the park. I really think it ended up being great, and I was worried about that.</p>
      <p>“So what if Deadpool 3 is eh? Then you just kind of look at the whole thing and that’s the one (that ruins it)?” Miller added.</p>
      <p>Last month, Deadpool 2 writers Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese said they hoped that Merc with a Mouth will continue to live in the R-rated universe they created, along with a possible crossover with the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).</p>
      <p>The writer duo, who are in for the potential third part, had said the project was still up in the air.</p>
