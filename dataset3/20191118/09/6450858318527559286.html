      </p>
      <p>If you can't afford the high-end RTX cards, then perhaps the GTX 1660 Ti with 6GB of GDDR6 memory will do the job for under £260.</p>
      <h3>Which graphics card should I buy?</h3>
      <p>Nvidia's RTX range of graphics cards is the obvious choice for a current gen card. However, if you can't afford one then there are still decent GTX GPUs on offer. Take a look at our <a href="https://www.techadvisor.co.uk/review/graphics-cards-pc-upgrades/nvidia-geforce-gtx-1080-founders-edition-review-3642306/">review of the GTX 1080</a> and the 1060 Ti is a good choice, too.</p>
      <p>Thanks to the influx of cryptocurrency mining and the increased production price of RAM along with Nvidia’s market dominance in this particular area, graphics cards have not been cheap over the past few years.</p>
      <h3>Things to consider</h3>
      <p>There are a couple of important factors to consider when purchasing a graphics card. First, you’ll need to think about what exactly you’re going to be using the card for. If you’re mainly playing World of Warcraft, League of Legends or Dota 2 then you’re not going to need a 1080 Ti to run those games on high settings at a decent frame rate.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, if you’re determined to play the latest and greatest games at the very highest settings then you’ll want a more powerful card.</p>
      <p>The resolution that you play your games at is very important when selecting a card. If you’re playing on a 1080p display then you’re not going to have much trouble getting solid performance, but if you’re using a 2k or 4k screen then you’ll need a faster card to cope with the demand from the monitor.</p>
      <p>The same goes with the refresh rate on your monitor. If you’ve gone out of your way to purchase a 120Hz or 144Hz monitor then you’ll need a machine that can reach those frame rates on your desired graphics settings, so it’s worth it to keep that in mind.</p>
      <p>Lastly, thinking about roughly how long you’ll be keeping your system is important too. You may think a 1080 Ti is more expensive but if it’s going to give you better performance and last longer in your rig before you replace it, in reality, it may be the better value purchase.</p>
      <p>A graphics card is not exactly an inexpensive purchase, so make sure you’re getting the most bang for your buck with the offers below.</p>
