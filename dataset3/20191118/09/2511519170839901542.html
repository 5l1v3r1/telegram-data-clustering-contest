      <h1>Why Gareth Bale’s Wales return will raise plenty of questions at Real Madrid this week</h1>
      <h2>Bale returned to action in Wales' Euro 2020 qualifier victory in Azerbaijan on Saturday – but has not played for Real Madrid in the month between the last two international breaks</h2>

      <p><a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/GarethBale">Gareth Bale</a> has made more headlines while not playing for <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/RealMadrid">Real Madrid</a> over the last month than ever during his six previous seasons in Spain, with his return to action in Wales’ <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Euro_2020">Euro 2020</a> qualifier victory in Azerbaijan on Saturday now setting up more drama next week.</p>
      <p>Bale did not play at all for Madrid in the month between the last two international breaks, following another injury during Wales defeat to Croatia on October 13. But the space was filled with a torrent of coverage – almost all of it negative – which has once again threatened the 30-year-old’s long term future at the Estadio Santiago Bernabeu.</p>
      <p>The exact fitness problem was never confirmed, leading to much questioning of Bale’s commitment to his club, especially when Spanish TV cameras ‘captured’ him visiting his agents offices in London on a day when his teammates were training. 11 of the 14 questions asked during Madrid coach <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/ZinedineZidane">Zinedine Zidane</a>’s news conference the following day concerned a player fit enough anyway to play in the team’s next game.</p>
      <p>“This is all old news,” Zidane said then. “We want him back in the team, nothing else. He’s training, and improving, but he’s not ready yet. We should bring him out to speak to you and tell you what he thinks. But he looks fine to me.”</p>
      <p>Bale of course was not presented to the Spanish media, and the attempts to quell the negative coverage did not work. That week also saw a ‘Bale-xit’ cover on Madrid-backing sports daily AS, based on the Welshman displaying a lack of knowledge [or interest] in British politics when speaking to the <i>Telegraph</i>. Even though in the same interview he emphasised how much he liked living in Madrid. Another low-point was AS’ own staff doctor speculating that Bale was not making himself available to play merely due to a ‘low pain threshold’.</p>
      <p>When Madrid drew 0-0 at home to Real Betis the following weekend, much of the post-game coverage fixated on Bale leaving the stadium just before full-time, even after Blancos defender Dani Carvajal told reporters that “Nobody should doubt Bale’s commitment. If I’m not in the squad, and it makes sense to leave 10 mins early, I do so.”</p>
      <p>A need to include some kind of Bale angle into all football coverage continued last week with Spain and Atletico Madrid midfielder Saul Niguez asked on <i>El Larguero</i> radio show if it was true that Bale was “super-introverted and never talks to anybody”. “The truth is we got on very well when we met, even speaking in Spanish!” Saul responded. “He’s a really nice guy.”</p>
      <p>That did not fit the established narrative, so the reporters quickly moved on to making a predictable joke about golf. “The first thing Bale thinks about is Wales, then golf and after that, Real Madrid,” said ex-Madrid player and sporting director Predrag Mijatovic on the same show. Mijatovic went on to admit that: “I’ve never spoken to him, but that’s how he comes across.”</p>
      <p>When it became clear last week that Bale had regained fitness in time to play for his country, <i>Marca </i>described it as the ‘Miracle in Wales’.  The man himself just laughed it all off when asked at a press conference ahead of Saturday’s game in Baku.</p>
      <p>“I’ve heard some stories but I don’t really take notice,” he said. “My friends send me some funny pictures or whatever they write. I find it hilarious to be honest. One said ‘triple bogey’. I’ve never had a triple bogey! At least give me an albatross! It’s funny.”</p>
      <p>Missing Madrid’s last six games either side of playing for Wales had just been a “kind of a coincidence”, he maintained. “I’ve tried to get back [to fitness] as quick as I can. Maybe to [the Spanish media] it doesn’t look great. But if I’m fit, no matter where I am, I’m going to try and play, whether for Wales or Madrid.”</p>
      <p>The numbers do show that Bale has missed plenty of games through recent years. Since joining Madrid in summer 2013, he has played 17,162 of possible 33,120 minutes for them [51%]. For Wales, it’s 3,358 of 5130, or 65%. Over that time, he has scored a goal every 165 minutes for club, and one every 152 minutes for country.</p>

      <p>These slightly better averages are taken in Spain as evidence he ‘cares less’ for Madrid, but another possibility is the set-up with Wales makes him feel more comfortable and play better.</p>
      <p>“With Wales, I’m speaking my own language and feeling more comfortable,” he admitted last week. “I definitely have a bit more excitement playing for Wales. I’ve been with most of the players since we were in the Under-17s. But it still doesn’t change what I give on the pitch. I always give 100% wherever I am.”</p>
      <p>An irony is that before his most recent injury, and despite all the confusion over his future last summer, Bale had actually been one of Madrid’s best players through the start of 2019/20. Two goals and two assists in six appearances were rewarded with supportive applause at the Bernabeu, while even Zidane praised his work off the ball and general attitude in games. He certainly made more of an impact than teammates Isco and James Rodriguez, who both receive much more favourable treatment from the local press.</p>
      <p>All the recent negative coverage has forced Zidane, perhaps despite himself, into defending a player he tried to force out of the club last summer. Meanwhile, there has been a noticeable lack support for Bale from reporters and pundits close to club president Florentino Perez. Sources at both the club and around the player deny that he might leave in January, with a decision to be made next summer. Everyone knows that that his high wages, age and injury record make an exit really difficult to manage.</p>

      <p>As it happened, Bale managed just 60 minutes in Baku on Friday evening, and did not look close to his best. Although he presumably enjoyed fans chanting: ‘Wales, Golf, Madrid’, and a flag at the stadium with the same message for Mijatovic.</p>
      <p>Wales’ 2-0 victory does mean that a win over Hungary in Cardiff on Tuesday will bring automatic qualification for Euro 2020. “Gareth was blowing a little bit which you can expect,” national manager Ryan Giggs said afterwards. “But hopefully he’ll start again on Tuesday, all being well.”</p>
      <p>Assuming he does come through the 90 minutes against Hungary, and the potential celebrations afterwards, Bale will be back in Madrid next week to prepare for high flying Real Sociedad at the Bernabeu on Saturday, and then Paris Saint Germain in the Champions League the following Tuesday.</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen whether Zidane immediately returns him to the XI, especially with Brazilian youngster Rodrygo Goes has emerged as a realistic option in attack, and new galactico Eden Hazard finally finding some form. The workrate and intensity during the 4-0 win at Eibar before the international break – without Bale or James – was easily Madrid’s best 90 minutes of the season.</p>
      <p>How the Bernabeu responds when Bale does eventually play there again will also be fascinating to see. Many in the Spanish capital seem determined to force him away from the club. It seems unlikely that Bale will ever again have full ‘excitement’ in a Blancos shirt. But the lack of support in and around the club just seems counter-productive.</p>
