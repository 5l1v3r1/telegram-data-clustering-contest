      <h1>A cryptic meme splashes the usually benign rock of Snohomish</h1>
      <h2>“Epstein didn’t kill himself” was a far cry from the usual fare of high-school pep and community spirit.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T09:30:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 09:30</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.heraldnet.com/author/andrea-brown/" target="_blank">Andrea Brown</a></address>
      <p>SNOHOMISH — The rock of Snohomish went rogue.</p>
      <p>For decades, the 7-foot-high boulder off Highway 9 and Bickford Avenue was painted with pleasantries — tributes to graduating classes or town heroes, maybe a bold invite to the prom. Nice, small-townish stuff like that.</p>
      <p>The messages recently deviated from the norm.</p>
      <p>For more than a week, “Epstein didn’t kill himself” was in bright red letters at the busy intersection. On a visit Monday the rock was tagged with NATO graffiti using the anarchy sign for the letter A.</p>
      <p>What’s up with that?</p>
      <p>The hot-button phrase refers to financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein’s hanging death in prison in August while he was awaiting trial on charges for trafficking minors.</p>
      <p>The trending hashtag #EpsteinDidntKillHimself is a meme on social networks.</p>
      <p>For some, it’s a joke. For others, it’s no joke.</p>
      <p>It’s a rallying cry, with polar motives depending on your political leanings.</p>
      <p>The slogan is showing up everywhere — sprayed on highway overpasses, branded on beer cans, written in snow and depicted in cartoons, such as the one depicting Bart Simpson writing it over and over on a chalkboard. A T-shirt reads, “Christmas lights are a lot like Epstein, they don’t hang themselves.”</p>

      <p>But on the precious rock of Snohomish?</p>
      <p>The quaint river town of 10,000 is known for antique shops, craft beer and wedding venues. It’s home of the <a href="https://www.heraldnet.com/news/one-heartbeat-is-the-mantra-for-panther-football/">Snohomish High School Panthers football team</a>. Kids grow up here, move away, and then come back to raise their children.</p>
      <p>The big rock is in a field near the park-and-ride on Bickford. A lot of people pass by and look to see what the latest message is.</p>
      <p>“This is the first time I’ve seen it not promote something relating to Snohomish High School teen spirit and things like that,” Mayor John Kartak said.</p>
      <p>He said the rock is not on city-owned property.</p>
      <p>“It’s our collective billboard,” resident Erin Gualco said. “It is a load-bearing wall in the structural integrity of our town.”</p>
      <p>Thirty years ago, she decorated the rock with other members of her Snohomish High Class of ’89.</p>
      <p>Messages often are “congratulating somebody who has accomplished or achieved something or passed on,” she said.</p>
      <p>She mentioned how the rock’s RIP to longtime <a href="https://www.heraldnet.com/news/snohomish-high-teacher-coach-tuck-gionet-led-by-example/">beloved Snohomish teacher and coach Charles “Tuck” Gionet in 2015</a> helped heal the community. “He was huge,” she said.</p>
      <p>She called The Daily Herald last week when she saw the Epstein phrase.</p>
      <p>“I think it’s brilliant,” Gualco said. “Everyone is talking about it and it’s valid. This is a big thing.”</p>
      <p>
        <anchor name="pd_a_10462548"/>
      </p>
      <p>She sees it as a means to keep the conversation going about the Epstein case.</p>
      <p>“He would have had the ability to implicate many people,” Gualco said. “People in the position of power are hoping they can sweep it under the rug and forget about it.”</p>
      <p>The meaning behind the Epstein message depends on the viewpoint.</p>
      <p>It could be a #MeToo shout-out or a statement for Trump 2020 and rant against the impeachment. It’s used by people of both political stripes with multiple conspiracy theories lurking behind the phrase about Epstein, <a href="https://www.heraldnet.com/nation-world/prince-andrew-says-he-let-down-the-royal-family/">whose old boys’ network included the likes of Bill Clinton, Donald Trump and Prince Andrew</a>.</p>
      <p>Rep. Paul Gosar, a Republican Arizona congressman, used the first letter of 23 tweets to spell out “Epstein Didn’t Kill Himself.”</p>
      <p>It’s a whodunnit — who wrote the Epstein message on the Snohomish rock, as well as who painted over it. Not that it matters. Other than a red lid and empty can of high-performance enamel tossed on the ground, the trail is cold.</p>
      <p>Facebook posts about the town’s rock got more than 1,000 shares and hundreds of comments.</p>
      <p>“We are going to end up on Tosh.0 again,” one remark read, referring to pop culture comedian Daniel Tosh’s coverage in September of the Snohomish woman who held a garage sale to sell all her husband’s stuff after she caught him cheating.</p>
      <p>The division between commenters was apparent, as this back-and-forth exchange illustrates:</p>
      <p>“The memes are usually hilarious, but leave the rock out of politics and conspiracies.”</p>
      <p>“The rock is a palette for public speech. Many have spoken through the rock. We cannot censure the rock’s artists nor their content.”</p>
      <p>“I’m not arguing either direction on the circumstances, I’m just here about the rock.”</p>
