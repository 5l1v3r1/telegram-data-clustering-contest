      <p>On Sunday afternoon, Prince Harry headed to Royal Albert Hall to take part in the OnSide Awards.</p>
      <p>The inaugural Onside Awards are set up by OnSide Youth Zones and honour youth making a difference in a number of categories.</p>
      <p>The Duke of Sussex was asked to attend where he gave a speech and presented the Health and Wellbeing Award.</p>
      <p>“I’ve been to lots of events in this building but the energy here tonight truly is something special,” Prince Harry said as he took the stage to thousands of screaming supporters. ” I feel privileged to be part of this community, so thanks for having me.”</p>

      <p>Harry then spoke about the influence that youth can have using environmental activist Greta Thunberg as an example.</p>

      <p>“When Greta started her climate change protest she was just 15 years old – one voice, with just one placard, sitting on her own outside the Swedish parliament. Many people (actually, I should say, many adults) dismissed her. Yet today, millions upon millions of young people have joined her fight,” the prince said.</p>
      <p>He then added, “She may have been just one person at the beginning, but she had a belief, a mission, and a desire to do something not just for herself but for everyone, and now – the whole world is paying attention.”</p>
      <p>While he was talking to the youth in the building, his speech could apply to anyone. “I know there are times when it feels like just putting one foot in front of the other is a victory. I know there will be weeks when you have to confront challenges, tackle demons, and face up to individuals who wish you harm. And I know there will be times when the only horizon you can see, is tomorrow,” the prince said before reminding them that there will always be people that will have their backs.</p>

      <p>As the Duke finished his speech he presented the Health and Wellbeing Award to the Strong Sisters’ project Blackburn Youth Zone that “allowed inspiration and empowerment of young girls from diverse backgrounds to challenge stereotypes and prejudice.”</p>
