      <p>Posting on social media, she said: “At 15 I was diagnosed with endometriosis.</p>
      <p>"One laparoscopy, many consultations and 8 years down the line, pain was back (more mild this time!) and my skin was THE WORST."</p>
      <p>After trying countless products and antibiotics, Daisy went on to discover she also has polycycstic ovaries.</p>
      <p>She went on to say she had cut down on diary and tried to get rid of sugar in her diet to help with her health.</p>

      <p>Singer-songwriter Emma was diagnosed with endometriosis aged 25 and was warned she only had a 50:50 chance of becoming a mum.</p>
      <p>Luckily, she did Strictly Come Dancing - in 2006, finishing in third place - where she was the "fittest she'd ever been and fell pregnant naturally".</p>
      <p>The Spice Girl star added: "I was so pleased, because obviously it's a scary time and you're not sure how it's going to end."</p>
      <p>Mum of two Emma, aka Baby Spice, said the condition disappeared after she had children.</p>

      <p>The Without Me hitmaker has spoken openly about her endometriosis and shared the “reality” of living with the condition with her fans.</p>
      <p>The American singer has been battling the medical condition for some time and even opted to have her eggs frozen aged 23.</p>
      <p>She said: “I can’t pretend any more. I can’t pretend that just because I’m a pop artist and I’m touring, that everything’s perfect and everything’s all good and my skin’s always great and I’m always fit and my outfits are always perfect.</p>
      <h3>What are the symptoms of endometriosis?</h3>
      <p>
        <b>There are many different symptoms of endometriosis and they can vary in intensity. Some women with endometriosis will have no symptoms at all.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The most common symptoms are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Painful periods</li>
        <li>Painful sex</li>
        <li>Infertility</li>
        <li>Painful bowel movements</li>
        <li>Fatigue</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Other symptoms include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lethargy</li>
        <li>Nausea</li>
        <li>Extreme tiredness</li>
        <li>Depression</li>
        <li>Frequent infections such as thrush</li>
        <li>Feeling faint/fainting during periods</li>
      </ul>
      <p>“Sometimes I’m bloated, I’m on an I.V., I’m sick, I’m on medicine, and I’m backstage, terrified that I’m going to bleed through my clothes in the middle of my show. That’s the reality of it.”</p>
      <p>The singer later described her endo diagnosis as a "bittersweet moment" - because she wasn't going crazy, and her pain was real.</p>
      <h3>Lena Dunham</h3>

      <p>The creator and star of hit HBO series Girls once described her endometriosis pain as "a fire slashing through her uterus".</p>
      <p>Lena, 33, has battled the condition for more than a decade and had eight surgeries before undergoing a total hysterectomy.</p>
      <p>Last year, the actress discussed her decision to undergo the radical surgery in a personal essay for Vogue.</p>
      <h3>Louise Redknapp</h3>

      <p>Louise, 45, struggled to conceive in her 20s before being diagnosed with endometriosis, which can cause infertility in severe cases.</p>
      <p>She had to go through laser surgery to have Charley, and during pregnancy developed chloasma, a facial pigmentation.</p>
      <p>It took the Strictly Come Dancing star four years to conceive hereldest son, Charley, now 15.</p>
      <p>But after the heartache of those fertility problems, second son Beau, now 11, came along surprisingly easily.</p>
      <p>Louise, who split from ex-footballer turned pundit Jamie Redknapp in 2017 - said: "It's hard having kids. It took me a long time to have Charley and, when he was born, it was a massive shock to the system.</p>
      <h3>Sacha Parkinson</h3>

      <p>Sacha also revealed her mum is an endo warrior - being forced to have a hysterectomy aged 24.</p>
      <p>In a parting message to others suffering from the condition, she said: "Listen to your body. Help others listen to theirs.</p>
      <p>"And help create a wider awareness. It's an invisible condition but very much a real one."</p>

      <p>Loose Women star Saira was diagnosed with the chronic condition in 2009 after four years of trying to have a baby.</p>
      <p>The mum-of-two was told her chances of conceiving naturally were less than five per cent because of the scarring on her fallopian tubes.</p>
      <p>Saira and her husband Steve decided to have IVF and fortunately fell pregnant with her son Zak the first tine.</p>
      <p>But the second time round the treatment failed and she decided to adopt her daughter Amara from an orphanage in Pakistan.</p>
      <p>Saira opened up about her experience with the condition on Instagram in March, as part of endometriosis awareness month, with a picture of her gorgeous family.</p>
      <p>The 49-year-old said: "I wanted to share this photo to support all the ladies out there who have endometriosis and want to become a mum.</p>
      <p>"Please don’t give up. Infertility does not automatically mean no children - adoption is a beautiful way to start and complete your family."</p>
      <h3>Sarah Hyland</h3>

      <p>Modern Family star Sarah Hyland has been very candid about her endometriosis struggles in the past.</p>
      <p>The American actress has bravely battled the condition while also undergoing two kidney transplants and a hernioa op.</p>
      <p>At the end of 2018, she revealed to <a href="https://www.self.com/story/sarah-hyland">SELF Magazine</a> that she struggles to work when she has a flare-up.</p>
      <p>She said: “It affects so many women, and so many women go undiagnosed and just think that they’re having horrible cramps and they’re being dramatic because that’s what they’re told.</p>
      <h3>#endoperiodstigma</h3>
      <p>The Scottish Sun Online has teamed up with Endometriosis UK to raise awareness of endometriosis.</p>
      <p>From now until March 2020, Endometriosis Awareness Month, we’ll be telling stories from women who are living with endometriosis plus provide original research and analysis.</p>
      <p>News Scotland, which includes The Scottush Sun, The Times Scotland and Sunday Times Scotland, has also joined the Endometriosis-Friendly Employer Scheme to show we are committed to supporting our employees.</p>
      <p>By March we hope to have signed up 100 new businesses - read how easy it is to do so <a href="https://www.endometriosis-uk.org/endometriosis-friendly-employer-scheme">here</a> and join us!</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>“[This week] I've had a flare-up with my endo. It has been hard to stand up straight, let alone work.”</p>
      <p>"But the fetal position helps a lot.”</p>
      <p>After an outpouring of support from fans, she added: "Hopefully those that are lucky enough not to experience this will learn about something new and take a moment to appreciate their health.</p>
      <p>"Thank you so much to all the love and light I have received today. I love you all."</p>

      <p>The Oscar-winning actress delivered a withering put-down to medics when talking about her "half-assed diagnosis".</p>
      <p>The 73-year-old also urged women not to let the condition rob them of a good life but admitted she was "one of the lucky ones" after going on to have three kids.</p>
      <p>She had the biggest impact on endo warriors when she challenged men to step up and make a difference during a speech.</p>
      <p>Speaking at an <a href="http://endometriosis.org/news/congress-highlights/susan-sarandon-speaks-up-about-endometriosis/">Endometriosis Foundation event</a> in 2011, she said: “Suffering should not define you as a woman. And just because you’re a man it doesn’t mean that it doesn’t affect you.</p>
      <p>"Help her to remove the taboos and the loneliness surrounding this disease; be understanding, show empathy, and don’t accuse her of being sensitive, delicate, or overly dramatic – this is a big opportunity for you guys to show that you care and to be a real man."</p>
      <p>In other endometriosis news, these are the symptoms to look out for.</p>
      <p>Here's how you can get your employer officially signed up as an endo friendly workplace.</p>
