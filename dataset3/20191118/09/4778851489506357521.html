      <p>After Kelly said: "That was crazy wasn't it? What's the point? Coming on and not answering any questions."</p>
      <p>When Morgan asked Ms Arcuri to respond to the comments, Kelly demanded: "What's the point you coming on the TV to clear the air and then you don't say anything?"</p>
      <p>Arcuri said: "I think I said a few things... what is it that you were looking for that I say?"</p>
      <p>Ms Kelly responded: "You didn't answer any of the questions that were put to you and I just don't see the point in you coming on, to be honest."</p>
      <p>On Twitter, Lorraine was trending, with one person writing: "Jesus, Lorraine is an actual savage."</p>
      <p>@MarkDiStef wrote: "Unbelievably savagery from Lorraine, the artist formerly known as Lorraine Kelly."</p>
      <p>Journalist @camillalong added: "I LOVE sassy Lorraine!"</p>
