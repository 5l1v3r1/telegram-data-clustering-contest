        <b>Denis Zakaria will not be leaving Borussia Monchengladbach in January, despite interest from a number of clubs across Europe, according to his agent.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Swiss midfielder has caught the eye during Gladbach’s surprise run to the top of the Bundesliga, scoring two goals in 11 league appearances.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old has been linked with <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/arsenal-fc/">Arsenal</a>, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/tottenham-hotspur-fc/">Tottenham</a>, <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/manchester-united-fc/">Manchester United</a> and Inter Milan thanks to his impressive performances, but it appears that all his suitors will at least have to wait until next summer to make a move.</p>
      <p>Zakaria’s agent, Mathieu Beda, has confirmed that his client will definitely not be leaving Gladbach during the next transfer window.</p>
      <p>‘Denis will not leave Borussia in the winter, a change is 100 per cent excluded,’ Beda told <a href="https://sportbild.bild.de/">Sport BILD</a> .</p>
      <p>‘Denis is in very good shape in Gladbach and has been playing really well for weeks, but he still has more potential and he wants to show that in Gladbach now instead of dealing with a change.’</p>

      <p>Zakaria plays in midfield for Switzerland alongside Arsenal’s Granit Xhaka, but with uncertainty still surrounding his future at the Emirates, there has been suggestion that <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2019/11/16/arsenal-hope-use-granit-xhaka-transfer-sign-rising-star-denis-zakaria-11169029/">a swap deal could be done for the two Swiss stars.</a></p>
      <p>Xhaka has not played for Arsenal since being stripped of the captaincy for his spat with fans while being substituted against Crystal Palace in October and could be offloaded either in January or next summer.</p>
      <p>The former Gunners captain moved to north London from Gladbach in 2016 and could be tempted by a return to his former club.</p>
      <p>Whether they play together at Arsenal, back at Gladbach or just with their national team, Xhaka has been thoroughly impressed with Zakaria.</p>
      <p>‘His development is outstanding’ said Xhaka. ‘Having Denis in the national team next to me makes me feel better. But he has to stay tuned – now comes a very crucial phase for him.’</p>
