      <p>The ex-Ivory Coast international spent many years at the top, mainly at the Citizens in England, where he became one of the most dominant midfielders in world football.</p>
      <p>Prior to taking to the field, however, Toure believed his game was influenced by what he was doing in the dressing room, with something as simple as lacing up his footwear.  </p>
      <p>Asked on a recent talk show if he had any specific pre-match traditions that he followed on, the 36-year-old revealed he always put his left boot on first.  </p>
