      <h1>Indonesia arrests dozens after IS-linked suicide bombing</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T09:50:23+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 09:50</time> by <a rel="author">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Dozens of suspected Indonesian militants have been rounded up after a suicide bomber linked to the Islamic State group killed himself and wounded six others in a police station attack last week, police said Monday.</p>
      <p>Some 45 suspects have been arrested since the Wednesday bombing in Medan on Sumatra island, while two bombmakers were shot dead during a raid, according to authorities.</p>
      <p>"The pair resisted arrest and tried to attack police with sharp weapons and an air gun," National Police spokesman Dedi Prasetyo told reporters in Jakarta on Monday.</p>
      <p>They had built a low-intensity bomb that the 24-year-old attacker strapped around his body, Prasetyo added.</p>
      <p>Authorities had earlier said they suspected the bomber was a "lone wolf", following the blast that wounded four police officers and two civilians.</p>
      <p>Police stations are frequent targets for radicals in the world's biggest Muslim-majority nation, which has long struggled with Islamist militancy.</p>

      <p>About 20 other suspects arrested since the bombing -- including the bomber's wife and the couple's religious mentor -- played what police described as direct roles in the attack and had links to Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD).</p>
      <p>The outfit is a local extremist group that has pledged allegiance to IS and carried out previous attacks, including suicide bombings at several churches last year that killed a dozen congregants.</p>
      <p>"The wife together with her husband (the bomber) were members of the JAD network," Prasetyo said.</p>
      <p>"They had also attended military camp training... and were taught how to buy guns and sharp weapons," he added.</p>
      <p>On Monday, some residents in Medan protested plans to bury the bomber's body in their city.</p>
      <p>The police station attack was revenge for earlier militant arrests by Indonesia's elite anti-terror squad Densus 88, Prasetyo said.</p>
      <p>Last month, President Joko Widodo ordered beefed-up security after two JAD-linked militants stabbed his chief security minister, who survived the attack.</p>
      <p>The Southeast Asian nation of some 260 million has significant numbers of religious minorities -- including Christians, Hindus and Buddhists -- who have been targeted by radical Islamist groups amid concerns about rising intolerance.</p>
