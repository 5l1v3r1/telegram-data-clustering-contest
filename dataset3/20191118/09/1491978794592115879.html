        <i>New Zealand PM says she’s disappointed her immigration minister was aware of the arrival but had not passed information on</i>
      </p>
      <p>Jacinda Ardern said she did not know that former Manus Island detainee <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/behrouz-boochani">Behrouz Boochani</a> was coming to New Zealand before his arrival, saying she was disappointed she was not given a “heads up” by her immigration minister.</p>
      <p>Speaking in Wellington on Monday, Ardern said she would have “preferred” it if the minister, Iain Lees-Galloway, had told her in advance about Boochani’s arrival.</p>
      <p>“Having said that, of course it is still a matter that ultimately the result would not have changed as a result of me knowing, but yes I would have preferred to have a heads up,” Ardern said.</p>

He is in New Zealand on a one-month visitor’s visa.</p>

      <p>When pressed on why she was kept in the dark about Boochani’s arrival, Ardern said it was an “operation decision” made by Immigration <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/newzealand">New Zealand</a>, “as you would expect for a visa decision”.</p>
      <p>Since landing in Christchurch, Boochani has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/15/no-special-treatment-for-behrouz-boochani-says-new-zealand">stated he would like to extend his visa to stay another month.</a> Ardern declined to speculate on those comments, saying that scenario was “totally hypothetical”.</p>
      <p>“He [Boochani] has the legal ability to be here for one month,” Ardern said. “It demonstrates that the system where he has already been identified as a refugee, he has travel documents, he has had the ability to apply to be legally here in New Zealand for the purposes of speaking at a conference.</p>
      <p>“He also, of course, is in the process of gaining approval; to be able to resident in the United States and anything beyond that is really speculative.”</p>
      <p>When it came to asylum claims in New Zealand, Ardern said, those matters are dealt with “totally independently” of politicians.</p>
      <p>“But, for now, of course he is legally here.”</p>
      <p>For six years New Zealand has had a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jul/22/manus-island-governor-urges-australia-to-help-resettle-refugees-urgently">standing offer to resettle 150 refugees a year from the offshore processing islands of Manus and Nauru</a>, but Australia has consistently rejected the offer.</p>
      <p>Arden said she had not spoken to Australia about Boochani.</p>
      <p>“I can’t speak for officials but certainly I haven’t nor would I expect to,” she said.</p>
      <p>“I see no need for me to engage personally with Australia on that matter.”</p>
      <p>While the prime minister did not know in advance about Boochani’s arrival, at least one other member of parliament other than the immigration minister had been kept in the loop.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/15/behrouz-boochani-today-aotearoa-new-zealand-stands-as-a-counterpoint-to-the-politics-of-hate">Golriz Ghahraman, an Iranian-born former refugee and Greens MP</a>, was at the airport to greet Boochani.</p>
      <p>When Ardern was asked if she would have gone to the airport herself had she had known Boochani was arriving, the answer was “no”.</p>
      <p>Lees-Galloways told the Guardian that he had not informed the prime minister of Boochani’s impending arrival because he himself did not know he had been granted his visa.</p>
      <p>“I was told [by Immigration New Zealand] he [Boochani] was applying to come and speak at the WORD conference [in Christchurch],” Lees-Galloways said.</p>
      <p>“I asked Immigration New Zealand to inform me when they had made their decision. Unfortunately, they did not follow up and let me know that his application had been approved.”</p>
      <p>“I was disappointed about this and would have liked to have been able to provide a heads up for the prime minister.”</p>
      <p>Lees-Galloways said he had spoken with Immigration New Zealand about the matter and that ICNZ had apologised.</p>
