      <h1>Exclusive: Confidence Man Share Spooky Video for New Single "Does It Make You Feel Good"</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T09:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 09:00</time> by <a rel="author">Lizzie Manno  </a></address>
      <p>Australian electro-pop four-piece Confidence Man released their debut album, <i>Confident Music for Confident People</i>, last year to critical acclaim, and now they’re sharing their first taste of new music. Today (Nov. 18), they’ve unveiled a new single, “Does It Make You Feel Good,” with an accompanying video premiering exclusively at <i>Paste</i>.</p>
      <p>“Does It Make You Feel Good” is invigorating dance-pop with the kind of pumping grooves that blur the line between the physical and spiritual. You can try your best to escape the clutches of their tantalizing rhythms, but paired with vibrant vocals and hypnotizing keyboards, they’re especially lethal. Led by Janet Planet and Sugar Bones, Confidence Man take listeners down a neon wormhole of house, pop and disco, posing questions as if they’re licensed dance music therapists.</p>
      <p>The “Does It Make You Feel Good” music video was shot in Berlin with long-time visual collaborators Schall and Schnabel, and it sees Confidence Man take part in a number of spooky religious rituals—there are sheep, lasers, candles, levitation and creepy black-cloaked figures who confusingly know how to boogie.</p>
      <p>Watch their new video for “Does It Make You Feel Good,” exclusively via <i>Paste</i>. Scroll down to view their upcoming tour dates.</p>
