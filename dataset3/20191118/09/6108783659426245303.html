      <h1>Simpsons widescreen issue will be fixed on Disney+ in 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T09:04:46+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 09:04</time> by <a rel="author">Steve Wright</a></address>
      <h3>Disney+ heads to Australia tomorrow... with slightly broken episodes of The Simpsons.</h3>
      <p>A <i><a href="https://stevivor.com/tag/the-simpsons/">Simpsons</a> </i>widescreen issue currently experienced on <a href="https://stevivor.com/news/disney-explained-availability-pricing-shows/">Disney+</a> will be fixed next year, Disney has confirmed.</p>
      <p>The issue comes after classic episodes of <i>The Simpsons</i>‘ were cropped and zoomed to fit a widescreen format. The change means a number of visual gags are not displayed as intended.</p>
      <p>Disney has confirmed the episodes will be viewable in their original 4:3 format next year.</p>
      <p>“We presented <i>The Simpsons</i> in 16:9 aspect ratio at launch in order to guarantee visual quality and consistency across all 30 seasons,” Disney said in a statement. “Over time, Disney+ will roll out new features and additional viewing options. As part of this, in early 2020, Disney+ will make the first 19 seasons (and some episodes from Season 20) of <i>The Simpsons</i> available in their original 4:3 aspect ratio, giving subscribers a choice of how they prefer to view the popular series.”</p>
      <p>We’ll let you know when the fix is in place. <a href="https://stevivor.com/news/disney-explained-availability-pricing-shows/">Disney+</a> is available now in the USA, Canada and other regions and <a href="https://stevivor.com/news/disney-heads-australia-november-90-aud-per-year/">heads to Australia tomorrow, 19 November</a>.</p>
