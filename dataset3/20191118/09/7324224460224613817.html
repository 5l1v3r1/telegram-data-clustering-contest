      <h2>Former Wolves physio Paul Darby expects Raul Jimenez to be in contention for Bournemouth after his Mexican exploits.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T09:35:16+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 09:35</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.expressandstar.com/news/authors/rosie-swarbrick/" target="_blank">Rosie Swarbrick</a></address>
      <p>Jimenez scored twice in Mexico's 3-0 CONCACAF clash at Panama on Saturday, and is expected to feature in Wednesday’s home clash with Bermuda.</p>
      <p>He is due to be back in the UK on Thursday and Darby believes it will take 48 hours for the forward to recover, just in time for Saturday’s Premier League trip.</p>
      <p>Speaking about international duty, he said: “It certainly affected players when I was in the game full-time because the travelling arrangements were somewhat archaic to the travel arrangements we have now.</p>
      <p>“I would be amazed if he did not come back on a private jet for one or at least at the very front end of a commercial aircraft.</p>
      <p>“As long as he has his body clock in the right schedules.</p>
      <p>“In other words when he is on the plane he will put himself into Mexican time or whenever he is playing.</p>
      <p>“Then when he comes out of that and comes back into English time he will hydrate himself correctly.</p>
      <p>“Really it should not take him more than 48 hours to feel that he is back at it.”</p>
      <p>Defender Romain Saiss faces a 14-hour flight home from Morocco’s Tuesday night clash at Burundi in central Africa.</p>
      <p>But he has an advantage of an extra day’s recovery, with Jimenez’s Mexican clash with Bermuda taking place at Estadio Nemesio Díez in Toluca on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>It takes approximately 12 hours to fly from Mexico City to Birmingham international.</p>
      <p>And Darby pointed to Wolves’ current successful Europa League recovery protocol as an example to what Jimenez and company will be doing as they rush back.</p>
      <p>He said: “Clubs invest money to make sure that once they have stopped playing wherever they are in the world that they don’t then have a 10 or 12 hour flight where they are just sitting or not looking after themselves.</p>
      <p>“They will have a protocol in place that means even when they are flying rehabilitation or recovery is taking place.</p>
      <p>“It is important to understand the recovery.</p>
      <p>“People say to me ‘oh they don’t work that hard, they don’t train that long’.</p>
      <p>“I say to people it is not in the exercising that you are getting the benefit it is in the recovery phase.</p>
      <p>“Therefore recovery is really important.</p>
      <p>“If the club have not quite got the recovery status right then it can affect performance.</p>
      <p>“That is why historically over the last few years Thursday night’s Europa League seems to have had an affect where Wednesday-Saturday Champions League has not.</p>
      <p>“It would look like Wolves have the Europa League recovery well under control.”</p>
