      <p>SEOUL: North Korea has responded to a tweet by US President Donald Trump that hinted at another summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, saying it has no interest in giving Trump further meetings to brag about unless it gets something substantial in return.</p>
      <p>The statement on Monday by Foreign Ministry adviser Kim Kye Gwan is the latest call by North Korea for US concessions ahead of an end-of-year deadline set by Kim<br/>Jong Un for the Trump administration to offer mutually acceptable terms for a deal to salvage nuclear diplomacy.</p>
      <p>Kim Kye Gwan says Washington must discard what North Korea sees as its “hostile” policies to keep the negotiations alive.</p>
