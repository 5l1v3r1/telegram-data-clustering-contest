      <p>A slight profit from the last round of international fixtures after we correctly called a big win for England against Montenegro. The international break just keeps on going, though, with some more crucial fixtures in the next few days, including Wales' must-win clash against Hungary.</p>

      <h3>The Banker</h3>
      <p>It's do-or-die for Wales on Tuesday evening. Slovakia's loss in Croatia means any win for Ryan Giggs' side against Hungary will be enough for them to qualify for Euro 2020. Wales cruised into Tuesday's decisive clash with a mature performance as they beat Azerbaijan 2-0 with minimal fuss in Baku.</p>
      <p>Anything other than three points here, though, and the Welsh will be forced to endure the lottery of the playoffs. It really is all to play for too. Hungary can go through with a win or indeed a draw in Cardiff, so the atmosphere should be crackling in the Welsh capital.</p>
      <p>Hungary are a decent side but Euro 2016 semifinalists Wales have a formidable recent record on home soil in qualifying (they are unbeaten in 10 matches) and a raucous Cardiff crowd can help drag the 8/11 shots over the line here.</p>

      <h3>The First-Goal Flutter</h3>
      <p>Republic of Ireland have been usurped by Denmark at the top of Group D so Monday night's clash in Dublin is a big one. The Danes are unbeaten in their last 14 matches and it could be worth a small punt on 'No Goalscorer' at a tidy 13/2. Ireland have only scored six goals in this qualifying campaign, and two of them came at home to Gibraltar. It could be cagey, and if the Irish can keep the shackles on talisman Christian Eriksen there's a good chance this finishes in a stalemate.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Selection: <a href="http://www.bet365.com/home/FlashGen4/WebConsoleApp.asp?affiliate=365_307577&amp;cb=%27s%27s%27s%27s">£2 on No Goalscorer at 13/2 with bet365</a>.</b>
      </p>
      <h3>The Tasty Treble</h3>
      <p>Spain have scored 16 goals and conceded just once in four home qualifiers so far and look a punt at 6/4 to cover a two-goal handicap against a very mediocre Romania side.</p>
      <p>Elsewhere, we also like Italy to cover a two-goal handicap against Armenia at 21/20. The Italians have recovered from their failure to qualify for Russia 2018 by sauntering to nine wins out of nine in qualifying for Euro 2020. They should make that 10 wins out of 10 and have enough quality to win this by at least a couple.</p>
      <p>Finally add in Scotland at 8/15 to beat Kazakhstan. From a betting perspective Scotland are often tough to trust but should be good enough on home soil and will be confident after that win in Cyprus. The Euro 2020 treble comes in at better than 13/2 with bet365 and should go close.</p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <h3>The Wildcard Tip</h3>
      <p>Germany are red-hot betting favourites when they host Northern Ireland on Tuesday. A record of six wins from seven matches has left Germany top of Group C heading into their final match, and they can finish with a flourish in Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>A 3-0 win for Joachim Low's side is available at 6/1 with bet365 and they should be motivated as anything less than a win opens the door for Netherlands to snatch top spot in the group.</p>
