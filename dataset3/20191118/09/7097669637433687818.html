      <h1>China's H-20 and JH-XX Stealth Bombers: Beijing's Very Own Deadly B-2 Bombers?</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T09:49:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 09:49</time> by <a rel="author" href="http://nationalinterest.org/" target="_blank">David Axe</a></address>
      <p><b>Key Problem:</b> China’s aircraft industry remains reliant on foreign-sourced components for dependable, proven, high-performance aircraft engines.</p>
      <p>China is developing not one but two new stealth bombers, the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency claimed in <a href="http://www.dia.mil/Portals/27/Documents/News/Military%20Power%20Publications/China_Military_Power_FINAL_5MB_20190103.pdf?utm_source=Daily%20on%20Defense%20(Template)_01/16/2019&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=WEX_Daily%20on%20Defense">a January 2019 report</a>.</p>
      <p>While the People's Liberation Army has not been shy about discussing <a href="https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/chinas-h-20-strategic-stealth-bomber-everything-we-know-right-now-38922">the H-20 strategic bomber</a> that the Xian Aircraft Industrial Corporation is developing for the PLA Air Force, there are many fewer public references to the other stealth bomber, which apparently carries the designation JH-XX.</p>
      <p>If the report is accurate and China completes development of the JH-XX, the Chinese air force could become the first air arm in the world to deploy a radar-evading fighter-bomber whose main mission is long-range ground-attack.</p>
      <p>Other stealth fighter types, including the U.S. military's F-22 and F-35, the Russian air force's Su-57 and the PLAAF's J-20 and J-31 either primarily are air-to-air fighters or combine air-combat capability with the ability to strike ground targets.</p>
      <p>Beijing’s goal of eventu­ally forcing Taiwan to unify with China has driven the new bombers' development. "Beijing’s anticipation that foreign forces would intervene in a Taiwan scenario led the PLA to develop a range of systems to deter and deny foreign regional force projec­tion," the DIA reported.</p>
      <p>The Pentagon's air base at Guam, a key staging area for U.S. warplanes operating over the Western Pacific, is a major potential target of China's new bombers.</p>
      <p>"The PLAAF is developing new medium- and long-range stealth bombers to strike regional and global targets," the DIA continued in its report. "Stealth technology contin­ues to play a key role in the development of these new bombers, which probably will reach initial operational capability no sooner than 2025.</p>
      <p>"These new bombers will have additional capabilities, with full-spectrum upgrades com­pared with current operational bomber fleets, and will employ many fifth-generation fighter technologies in their design."</p>
