      <p>Chevrolet has resurrected its memorable Blazer for 2019 in a manner befitting contemporary times. The new Blazer is a midsize crossover SUV with Camaro-inspired styling, street smarts, up-to-the-minute technology, comfort and convenience features everywhere, and decent fuel economy.</p>
      <p>The 2020 Blazer is available now, adding a 230-horsepower turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine to the existing 193-horsepower 2.5-liter four-cylinder and 308-horsepower V6. Take note that the new turbo engine is scheduled for late model year 2020 availability.</p>
      <p>Trim levels are modified for 2020 due to the new turbo engine and are now L, LT, 2LT, 3LT, RS, and Premier.</p>
      <p>2020 L and LT trims have the 2.5-liter engine and are front-wheel-drive only. The 2LT and 3LT get the new turbo engine, and offer the options of all-wheel drive and the V6 engine. RS and Premier versions come standard with all-wheel drive and the V6.</p>
      <p>All versions have a nine-speed automatic transmission.</p>
      <p>Pricing starts at $29,995 (including a $1,195 destination charge) for the L model.</p>
      <p>The 2020 Chevrolet Blazer has two rows of seats, accommodating up to five passengers, and a rear cargo area measuring about 31 cubic feet with rear seats upright. It’s a roomy interior with comfortable seating. There’s a Chevy-first cargo management system that keeps items in place with rails and a cargo fence.</p>

      <p>My tester was a 2020 Blazer Premier, richly adorned with beautiful Midnight Blue Metallic paint and a Jet Black/Maple Sugar two-toned interior with sueded microfiber accents. It was equipped with an optional ($2,265) Driver Confidence II Package adding such things as forward collision alert, enhanced automatic emergency braking, lane keeping assist with lane departure warning, and advanced adaptive cruise control. Also included in the package are wireless charging, LED headlamps with automatic high-beam control, rear camera mirror, and HD surround vision.</p>
      <p>As expected for the top-tier Premier model, standard features are indulgent. A sampling: heated steering wheel, heated and ventilated front seats with eight-way power adjustment for the driver and four-way for the front passenger, an eight-speaker Bose audio system, and Chevy’s Infotainment 3 Premium system with eight-inch display, navigation, and Android Auto and Apple CarPlay capability.</p>
      <p>Fuel economy ratings for the tester are 18 mpg city, 25 mpg highway, and 21 mpg combined. Maximum towing capacity for the V6 engine is 4,500 pounds, and trailer-hitch guidance with hitch view is standard on the 2020 Blazer Premier.</p>
      <p>The Blazer Premier’s acceleration, steering response, and braking are right on the mark. Its ride is forgiving of bumpy road conditions, and noise is suppressed at highway speeds thanks to generous insulation measures as well as active noise cancellation.</p>
      <p>Infotainment operations are simple and straightforward, and the touchscreen’s response is quick and precise. There are Camaro-inspired center vents for the climate control system, and twisting their large rings is how temperature adjustments are made. They’re fun to use.</p>
      <p>Diehard fans of the old Blazer might stubbornly refuse to accept this new one. I get it. I used to own one of those old Blazers, one of the earliest two-door versions, and I loved it. But its fuel economy could be measured in inches, terribly noxious stuff came out of the tailpipe, and it rode like a stagecoach. Let’s face it, the new Blazer is infinitely better. OK, boomers?</p>
