      <p>Over the next two days, Athens is hosting a United Nations conference that aims to discuss the effects of climate change on transport infrastructures in Europe.</p>
      <p>‘Raising awareness on adaptation of transport infrastructure to climate change impacts’ is jointly hosted by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and Hellenic Logistics Association.</p>
      <p>Experts warn that extreme weather events, some of which are increasing in intensity and frequency, as well as slower onset climate changes and cumulative effects can result in transportation infrastructure damages, operational disruptions and pressures on supply chain capacity and efficiency.</p>
      <p>The conference was opened by Infrastructure &amp; Transport Minister Kostas Karamanlis and is attended by researchers and experts from the UN, the European Union, academia and the World Meteorological Organisation, and from related ministries in Canada, France, Germany, Iceland, the Netherlands, Poland, and Turkey.</p>
      <p>The conference aims to disseminate information, including the report, and to alert countries to the need for future planning and measures implemented at sections of roads, railways, waterways or at terminals or ports.</p>
      <p>UNECE official Martin Dagan on Tuesday will present a report on the impact of climate change on European transportation networks and nodes, which he has been researching alongside others since 2010.</p>
