      <h3>With there being no backup or replacement for Sergio Busquets at Barcelona, the Catalans need to start planning for life after the Spaniard.</h3>
      <p>Barcelona midfielder Sergio Busquets is the last one remaining from the trio of midfielders from the Catalans’ golden era. Pep Guardiola established the Spain international into the fold, but all the subsequent managers put their faith in the defensive midfielder for the right reasons and Busquets never let the team down. However, he has changed recently.</p>
      <p>Sergio Busquets’ commitment to the club is unquestionable, but his inconsistent displays have come into scrutiny of late. The player is no more indispensable from the Barca squad and has shown signs of slowing down lately. Most of it is down to the reason that there is no replacement for him, but that needs to change soon as he is now in his last few years at the top.</p>
      <p>Here is a look at the five likely replacements that the Blaugrana could sign for Busquets.</p>
      <h4>FRENKIE DE JONG</h4>
      <p>Frenkie de Jong has been amazing since arriving from Ajax Amsterdam and has settled into the Barcelona squad really well. The Netherlands international’s gameplay does not make him look like a newcomer and it is only upwards for him from hereon without a doubt. Currently, de Jong has been employed in an attacking role.</p>
      <p>However, the 22 year old is capable of playing as a defensive midfielder in an impeded role and has been deployed as one by Erik ten Hag in some of the matches last season. Frenkie de Jong could be used in a similar position by the Blaugrana as well and would make an ideal replacement to Sergio Busquets in the longer run.</p>

      <h4>RODRIGO BENTANCUR</h4>
      <p>Juventus midfielder Rodrigo Bentancur has been linked with a move to the Camp Nou recently after falling down the pecking order under Maurizio Sarri. The Uruguay international is a player of great intricacy and it is absurd to understand why the former Chelsea boss has not been using him in his roster as a regular player.</p>
      <p>Barca could sign him for a reported transfer fee of 35 million euros from the Old Lady of Turin and even the South American midfielder himself would be keen on a transfer. Given his quality and regularity with playing for Uruguay, Bentancur would be a great signing for the Catalans and even the player would benefit by signing for a bigger outfit than his current one.</p>
      <h4>LUCAS TORREIRA</h4>
      <p>After a brilliant few outings at the FIFA World Cup 2018 in Russia, Uruguay international Lucas Torreira completed a move from Serie A club Sampdoria to Premier League giants Arsenal. Torreira’s first season was a great one with the Gunners, but his second season has been a let down and his agent has confirmed that the player is unhappy with first-team boss Unai Emery using him in an advanced role.</p>
      <p>Arsenal don’t seem to be going on an upward run and winning big anytime soon, so this would probably be the best time for the Blaugrana to sign Lucas Torreira. Napoli have lately shown interest in his services, but should a bigger club needing a regular defensive midfielder come knocking then the player turning down a return to the Serie A is practically a no-brainer.</p>

      <h4>N’GOLO KANTE</h4>
      <p>Chelsea superstar N’Golo Kante was unhappy with his role under Maurizio Sarri but has gone back to playing well and in his original role since Frank Lampard took over.</p>
      <p>The Frenchman is inarguably among the world’s best defensive midfielders and at just 28, he still has a few more years of football left in him at the very top level.</p>
      <p>Barcelona may look to sign the former Leicester City superstar after his exploits in England have won him every domestic trophy apart from the Carabao Cup as well as the Europa League in his previous season with Chelsea. Kante would certainly dream of winning the Champions League, so a hungry club like Barca could be on the same page with his ambition. Should the Catalans look to sign him, they will need to pay a big transfer fee.</p>
      <h4>JULIAN WEIGL</h4>
      <p>Borussia Dortmund superstar Julian Weigl is an indispensable player under Lucien Favre over the last season or so. Since checking in from 1860 Munich, the Bundesliga giants have employed the defensive midfielder frequently and Weigl has gone on to create a name for himself in the recent months, especially after Dortmund’s domestic run in 2018/19.</p>
      <p>Real Madrid have already shown interest in signing Weigl, but they cannot guarantee him a place in their first-choice eleven because Casemiro is still going strong. That is where Barca could turn the balance in their favour and since Weigl is just 24 years old, he is possibly a right man for the Blaugrana with a fair amount of experience under his belt as well.</p>
      <p>Who do you think Barca should sign as a long-term replacement for Busquets?</p>
