      <p>It is suspected the thieves used a digger in a bid to rip the cash machine from the wall of Carlisles filling station and convenience store in Belfast Road.</p>
      <p>The road was closed on Monday morning, causing major disruption to rush-hour traffic.</p>
      <p>The attack is the latest in a series of ATM raids in Northern Ireland this year.</p>
      <p>The latest ATM theft attempt follows a similar incident at the weekend when thieves <a href="http://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2019/11/18/news/thieves-tried-to-rip-atm-from-belfast-city-hospital-1767924/">tried to rip a cash machine from Belfast City Hospital</a> before ramming the shutters of a string of businesses in the city and Lisburn.</p>
      <p>Industry organisation Retail NI condemned the latest attacks.</p>

      <p>Chief executive Glyn Roberts said: "Words fail to describe my anger at this disgraceful attempted ATM robbery on one of our members.</p>
      <p>"This has caused extensive damage to one of Ballynahinch's largest retailers in the run-up to Christmas.</p>
      <p>"This is an independent retailer, who provides an invaluable service to the local community, awakened from his sleep to be told his business is smashed up.</p>
      <p>"It is also a new low for these robbers to attack health centres to steal ATMs.</p>
      <p>"We would urge all businesses and organisations who have external ATMs to be vigilant and urge members of the public with any information to contact the PSNI."</p>
