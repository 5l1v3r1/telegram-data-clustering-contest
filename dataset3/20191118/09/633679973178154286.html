      <p>It took 145 mm of rain over two days at Kareedouw last week, followed by some decent follow-up rain at the weekend, to raise the average level of Nelson Mandela Bay's main supply dams by a mere 2%</p>
      <p>That's the harsh reality of the latest figures for Nelson Mandela Bay's main supply dams, released by the municipality on Monday morning.</p>
      <p>The average level of the four main supply dams is currently 36.24%, up marginally from 34.72% last Thursday.</p>
      <p>The Kouga is at 33.90% and yesterday the Churchill was overflowing, albeit it very slightly, at 100%</p>
      <p>Garth Sampson at the PE Branch of the SA Weather Service said this run-off, or overflow, would eventually reach the Impofu which is currently at a mere 16.79% and so low that water cannot be extracted from it using conventional methods.</p>

      <p>Sampson warned residents that despite the good rains of last week, the drought situation is far from over and residents must continue using water sparingly.</p>
