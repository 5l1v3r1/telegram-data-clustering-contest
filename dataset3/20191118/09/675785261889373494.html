      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T09:21:38+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 09:21</time> by <a rel="author">Andy Rudd, Chris Kitching, Talia Shadwell, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/andy-rudd/, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/chris-kitching/, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/talia-shadwell/</a></address>
      <p>A heartbreaking photo shows the family of a <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/missing-persons">missing</a> woman holding her brother's hand "until the very last moment" as he died in hospital.</p>
      <p>Dad John Croucher confirmed the death of his son Haydon, 24, nine months after his daughter Leah vanished without a trace when she was 19.</p>
      <p>Mr Croucher, from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, told how the family's world is "broken" after Haydon died just days after he reassured him "that we all feel the same sadness" over Leah's disappearance.</p>
      <p>The family has posted a number of poignant tributes on <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/facebook">Facebook</a> , including a photo showing Haydon's hand being held by his dad, his mum Tracey Furness and sister Jade.</p>

      <p>Jade, who posted the photo, wrote: "Haydon, Me Mum and Dad held onto your hand until the very last moment but we will hold you in our hearts forever!</p>
      <p>"You will always be with us until the day we meet you again.</p>
      <p>"Mum and Dad might not be together but one thing that will never waver is the love they have for you their darling son!</p>
      <p>"We will all stick together as a unit and get through the pain with the love and support of both of our amazing stepparents Dave and Claire."</p>

      <p>Haydon had been involved in the search for his younger sister, who has turned 20 since she went missing in February in a case that has baffled detectives.</p>
      <p>Her family fear she was murdered.</p>
      <p>Heartbroken over the disappearance of his daughter and death of his son, Mr Croucher wrote: "What kind of life is it that you can speak to your son on Thursday evening to reassure him that we all feel the same sadness at Friday 15th, approaching nine months with no news about Leah is a terrible thing to face. </p>
      <p>"We promise to meet up the following day so we can face it together. Hours later police knock at the door and tell you that Haydon is fighting for his life.</p>

      <p>"The doctors say the prognosis is bad. You sit by his bedside and watch him deteriorate by the minute. You have to say your goodbyes. What do you say in that situation? </p>
      <p>"You tell him you love him. You reminisce about funnier times. You beg him to come back to us. Finally you have to tell him to go and be at peace. You hold him as he slips away. To say our hearts and minds are broken is an understatement."</p>
      <p>Paying tribute to his son, he added: "Haydon was a kind, generous, funny, witty and loving person and in his words an amazingly good looking bloke. He had a huge heart.</p>
      <p>"He was only 24. Too young to be gone forever. He has left behind two families and friends that loved him dearly. We will all miss him. Always. </p>

      <p>"Be at peace Haydon. If Leah is up there with you look after each other as always, until we get there. We love and miss you both terribly. Our world could not be more broken than it is now."</p>
      <p>Haydon's mother Tracey Furness told how she was "forever broken and forever lost".</p>
      <p>She wrote: "How do I express the pain that no mother should have to endure my son my darling son Haydon.</p>
      <p>"You mean the world to me and I cannot even begin to process the pain and heartache that I feel.</p>
      <p>"My world has fallen to pieces without you. You were the most loving boy and the bond we had will stay with me until eternity.</p>
      <p>"Giving life to you to see life go from you makes no sense. A mother should never have to bury their child!!</p>

      <p>"You loved with all your heart, family meant absolutely everything to you and you meant everything to us.</p>
      <p>"My son 24 years of life, 24 years of love, 24 years young but still my baby boy. I will NEVER be the same.</p>
      <p>"I am forever broken and forever lost. Rest in peace my beautiful boy. Mummy loves you."</p>
      <p>Leah disappeared while walking to work in Milton Keynes at about 8.15am on February 15. Her mobile phone and bank account have not been used since.</p>
      <p>Three witnesses reported that a young woman who could possibly have been Leah was seen by Furzton Lake between 9.30am and 11.15am.</p>
      <p>She was reported as being "angry, upset and crying". A search of the lake was carried out but nothing was found.</p>

      <p>The night before, Leah had lied to her parents about where she was on Valentine's Day, according to Thames Valley Police.</p>
      <p>Police have said she told her parents she was meeting a friend when she left the house at 6pm on 14 February, but that was not the case.</p>
      <p>The force appealed for information about where she was between 6pm and 7.15pm.</p>
      <p>In May, Haydon had appeared at Aylesbury Crown Court accused of threatening a man who had dated Leah.</p>
      <p>He accepted a restraining order from Judge Francis Sheridan and the prosecution was dropped.</p>
      <p>At the time the judge told him: "This is a real tragedy. You and your family are entitled to and deserve our utter sympathy."</p>

      <p>The judge continued: "I cannot go into the details of the police investigation but can tell you it is being controlled at a very high level. It is detailed and, if I respectfully say so, they really are trying desperately hard.</p>
      <p> "You must allow them, however strongly you feel, to do the investigating. You will jeopardise their investigation if you get it into your head that somebody is responsible for it.</p>
      <p>"The police have fully investigated the person that you suspected. There is, at this stage, nothing to support those suspicions.</p>
      <p>"Can I plead with you to behave so that police can complete this investigation, I would love to say 'with a happy ending,' but I simply do not know. She is missing."</p>
      <p>Despite emotional pleas from Leah's family, as well as a £5,000 reward offered for any information which could lead to her being found, police have not found any trace of her.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, in a tearful interview on This Morning, Mr Croucher and his wife Claire said they do not believe Leah vanished deliberately.</p>

      <p>They said they believe she was murdered.</p>
      <p>Mrs Croucher said: "If the worst has happened, I would like my daughter's body back so her family can have a burial and we can say goodbye - because everybody deserves that."</p>
      <p>Mr Croucher added: "Truthfully, I do not believe she has run away. She has got a fair amount of money in the bank and that has not been touched. If you are running away, surely you would take something?"</p>
      <p>Mrs Croucher also spoke publicly for the first time about her daughter's relationship with an older man - a 27-year-old who Leah's protective brother Haydon had accused of "grooming" her, before the restraining order was served.</p>
      <p>She said on the programme: "We were not aware of a relationship before she went missing. We've found out since that she was seeing somebody but that person has been spoken to."</p>
      <p>Police have previously confirmed there was no reason to suspect the man.</p>
