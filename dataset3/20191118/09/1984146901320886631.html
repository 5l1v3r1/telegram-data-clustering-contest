      <h1>Why Newcastle's game at Aston Villa will tell us where the Magpies really are</h1>
      <h2>With Manchester City to follow, a positive result at Villa Park could be vital to maintain a healthy Premier League position</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T09:30:36+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 09:30</time> by <a rel="author">John Gibson</a></address>
      <p>Newcastle United are always at the crossroads. It's in the DNA.</p>
      <p>I mean a few short weeks ago the Mags were doomed. They had lost 5-0 at Leicester, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/steve-bruce">Steve Bruce</a> had spectacularly blown the tactics, and relegation was the dreaded word on every Geordie's lips.</p>
      <p>Right now, however, back-to-back victories and a zoom up to 13th place with daylight between us and the relegation dwellers has brought a lightness of spirit. The sun has emerged from a leaden sky.</p>
      <p>So in reality where exactly are we?</p>
      <p>If your glass is half-full, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-united-fc">United</a> have a great opportunity to cement Premier League respectability with three of their next four matches against Aston Villa, Sheffield United, and Southampton. Opportunity knocks.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, if your particular glass is half-empty then United can be seen as still hovering on the cusp of disaster. Should they lose at Villa on Monday of next week then considering that champions Manchester City are next up it could be consecutive defeats which would bring everything crashing back to earth.</p>
      <p>See what I mean?</p>
      <p>Of course I wish to remain optimistic because it is much the better world in which to dwell, but what it all does tell us is how crucial the Villa match is. The result is of paramount importance.</p>
      <p>A game which brings together not just historic clubs but sets of fans who, shall we say, do not like each other too much. A lot remember Sob On The Tyne like a festering sore!</p>
      <p>It's also a match where Steve Bruce and <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/ciaran-clark">Ciaran Clark</a> return to their old residency of Villa Park.</p>
      <p>A match where Villa hope big-hitters Jack Grealish and Tom Heaton will return to help halt a run of bad results, where United hope any one of their front three break the habit of a lifetime and score but where defenders netting from set pieces yet again would be lauded to the skies.</p>
      <p>Grealish, who has missed Villa's last three games, is back in training and looks likely to return having been a big miss in recent defeats to good sides like Wolves, Liverpool, and Man City. He is a cult hero, the skipper, after having been seen as a loose cannon blowing his potentially soaring career.</p>
      <p>These are two clubs who once ruled England but now live on memories.</p>

      <p>Newcastle can boast winning the old First Division championship four times but three were at the turn of the 20th century and the last 1927. The FA Cup has been ours six times but again the last as long ago as 1955 and Europe has been conquered once with the Fairs Cup claimed 50 years ago.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile Villa have seven championships, five between 1894 and 1900 and the last in 1981. The FA Cup has also been theirs seven times but not since 1957. The League Cup won five times the last being 1996, 23 years ago. Their lone European success was the top trophy in 1982.</p>
      <p>These are giants who have become pygmies in terms of claiming meaningful silverware. They may be 207 miles apart but they are linked by years of under-achieving.</p>

      <p>Both Newcastle and Villa have but one aim this season - to avoid relegation. Villa have just come up having lost their play-off final under Steve Bruce the year before, while United have been kept up by Rafa Benitez for the last couple of seasons and are attempting to avoid their third relegation under <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/mike-ashley">Mike Ashley.</a></p>
      <p>Great, isn't it, while Bournemouth, Watford, and Burnley have comfortably survived in the PL, Leicester City have won the title, and Wigan Athletic (2013) and Portsmouth (2008) have lifted the FA Cup.</p>
      <p>Still, we could be Sunderland couldn't we?</p>
