      </p>

      <p>The pricing is as expected remembering that once you buy a game there is no monthly charge to stream it. Some of the titles are expensive compared to their console counterparts but given that you can play the game anywhere on basically any device (eventually) without having to fork out more money it is not such a bad deal.</p>
      <p>Of course it is not available here in Australia just yet but if you are interested in checking it out when it doesn’t come here head on over to the <a href="https://store.google.com/magazine/stadia_not_available?srp=/product/stadia_games">Stadia website</a> and sign up for updates.</p>
