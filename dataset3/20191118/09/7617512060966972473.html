      <p>Three years ago, leaders from local municipal and First Nations governments, businesses, post-secondary schools, non-profits, and industry associations took a leap forward to create a regional alliance to pursue economic development across the Greater Victoria region.</p>
      <p>The South Island Prosperity Partnership (SIPP) was first founded by 28 members who wanted to see a more vibrant, prosperous region. Today, SIPP stands united together with more than 55 members. SIPP’s collective belief is that through collaboration, incredible results can be achieved that would not be possible working alone.</p>
      <p>“We’re honored to work together with our members to boost prosperity in this incredible region we call home. Every day we aim to create a lasting and sustainable economy. Nothing could be more important than ensuring South Vancouver Island remains strong, resilient, and future proof for the next generation,” says SIPP CEO Bruce Williams.</p>
      <p>SIPP works toward boosting prosperity in the South Island through a number of approaches to economic development. One way is by increasing the amount of provincial, federal and private funds invested locally. SIPP also works to attract values-based companies who share a collective view of the future and prosperity on Southern Vancouver Island.</p>
      <p>“SIPP brings partners together through shared governance, special projects, dialogues and roundtables, citizen engagement activities, economic research, exploring big ideas through thought leadership, and by advocating on behalf of regionally significant issues,” says Board Chair Craig Norris.</p>
      <p>However, the region cannot be truly prosperous unless everyone is included. The South Island is home to ten First Nations and over 17,000 Indigenous people. SIPP strongly supports First Nation self-directed economic development activities by collaborating with communities, sharing leading practices, and creating an inclusive platform for broader collaboration.</p>
      <p>SIPP is continually growing and adding more members. Click <a href="https://adserver.pressboard.ca/c/link?c=234470&amp;w=100229&amp;l=234474">HERE</a>to visit our site.</p>
