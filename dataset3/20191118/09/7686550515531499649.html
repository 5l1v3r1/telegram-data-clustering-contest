      <p>Piers Morgan is normally the one asking the controversial questions on Good Morning Britain, but he was overshadowed by Lorraine Kelly who confronted American businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri on live television.</p>
      <p>The Scottish presenter, who is normally known for her more gentle line of questioning, asked the woman at the centre of a controversy involving Prime Minister Boris Johnson why she had bothered to come on the television when she had said "nothing".</p>
      <p>Ms Arcuri's links with Mr Johnson came under public scrutiny earlier this year over allegations she received favourable treatment for her business ventures during his eight-year stint as Mayor of London.</p>
      <p>Speaking to Piers Morgan and Susanna Reid about their relationship, she called it "very special" but she refused to say whether they had an affair.</p>

      <p>Asked directly on ITV's Good Morning Britain programme "was it an affair", Ms Arcuri said: "I'm not going to answer that question, but as you can tell there was a very special relationship there and when it did come out, half the people already assumed the affair and told me to admit. The other half just wanted me to deny, deny, deny."</p>
      <p>After the interview had finished, Lorraine came on as usual to tell viewers what was on her show, but said, "God, that was crazy wasn't it? What is the point of coming on and not answering any questions."</p>
      <p>Ms Arcuri, who was drinking a cup of the tea at the end of her interview, looked confused.</p>
      <p>Lorraine directly addressed her repeating, "What is the point you coming on and not saying anything?".</p>
      <p>Ms Arcuri, looking confused, said: "I'm sorry?"</p>
      <p>Lorraine said: "What is the point of you coming on the TV to clear the air and then you don't say anything?"</p>
      <p>Ms Arcuri replied: "I believe I said a few things. What is it that you are looking for that I say?"</p>
      <p>"You didn't answer any of the questions that were put to you and I don't see the point of you coming on to be honest," replied Lorraine. "Anway, let me tell you what is coming on after half past."</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Earlier, the American businesswoman had said he had asked Boris Johnson to acknowledge the fact that she has "been made the collateral damage of his quest for greatness".</p>
      <p>Pushed on how many children Mr Johnson may have, Ms Arcuri said: "I think I have a vague idea. I asked him once."</p>
      <p>She added: "I asked him once if he had as many kids as Ken Livingstone, and he said no."</p>
      <p>Asked for more detail, Ms Arcuri continued: "Well, he had the four, and one with another woman."</p>
      <p>Asked whether the public should know these details of Mr Johnson's life, Ms Arcuri replied: "Sure, sure, it's part of what I would say, you know, would be becoming of his character."</p>
      <p>In another interview with ITV Exposure, Ms Arcuri claimed Boris Johnson cast her aside as though she was a "gremlin" after she tried to contact him for advice on how to handle the media interest.</p>
      <p>The show alleged the pair were involved in an affair for more than four years.</p>
      <p>Ms Arcuri has refused to say whether one took place and again would not be drawn on the nature of their relationship on the programme, but did say she had come under pressure from friends to "admit the affair".</p>
      <p>She said: "When the story broke half the people that reached out told me to categorically deny, deny, deny the other half told me to, admit the, er, affair, fall on the sword get it over with."</p>

      <p>Addressing Mr Johnson directly, Ms Arcuri told ITV: "I've been nothing but loyal, faithful, supportive, and a true confidante of yours. I've kept your secrets, and I've been your friend.</p>
      <p>"And I don't understand why you've blocked me and ignored me as if I was some fleeting one-night stand or some girl that you picked up at a bar because I wasn't - and you know that.</p>
      <p>"And I'm terribly heartbroken by the way that you have cast me aside like I am some gremlin."</p>
      <p>Mr Johnson has said his dealings with Ms Acuri were "done with complete propriety".</p>
      <p>Asked by journalist John Ware if she wished Mr Johnson had declared their relationship as an interest, Ms Arcuri said: "I didn't know anything about having to declare me.</p>
      <p>"Now if you're asking if he had declared me, would I have preferred that to avoid all of this humiliation? Absolutely."</p>
      <p>Ms Arcuri said she became "collateral damage" from the controversy while Mr Johnson escaped "unaffected".</p>
      <p>She was reportedly given £126,000 in public money and privileged access to three foreign trade missions led by Mr Johnson while he was in City Hall.</p>
      <p>Earlier in October, a City Hall investigation into their relationship was paused following a request by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) while a Government review ruled a £100,000 grant she was given by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media &amp; Sport through a cyber skills fund was "appropriate".</p>
      <p>Ms Arcuri spoke of another earlier attempt to speak to Mr Johnson after he became Prime Minister.</p>
      <p>"When I expressed the interest to want to speak to him, I was told there are bigger things at stake and I was brushed off as if I was one of Kennedy's girlfriends showing up to his White House switchboard, you know, here to do my, you know, calling," Ms Arcuri said.</p>
      <p>"And I felt so disgusted and humiliated that I was told bigger things are at stake, never mind you, he's too busy for you."</p>
      <p>In response to the programme a Conservative Party spokesman said: "Any claims of impropriety in office are untrue and unfounded. We consider these are vexatious and politically motivated attacks from the Labour Party in City Hall.</p>
      <p>"Previous vexatious and unfounded allegations against the Prime Minister have been thrown out by the courts. An independent review by the Government Internal Audit Agency showed the claims made by the Labour Party about Ms Arcuri's company were false.</p>
      <p>"Given that City Hall has made an unfounded complaint to the IOPC, we will not be making detailed comments until that process has finished. Full assistance has been offered to the IOPC so the matter can be quickly resolved."</p>
