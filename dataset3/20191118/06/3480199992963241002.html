      <p>Experts have said the NHS is heading for one of its “bleakest” ever winters, and 100,000 people could end up stuck on trolleys waiting for hospital beds.</p>
      <p>One in six patients waited longer than four hours in A&amp;E in England during October – the worst-ever performance since the government's four-hour target was introduced in 2004.</p>
      <p>In Shropshire, NHS England figures show about one in three patients waited longer than four hours last month.</p>

      <p>The government says 95 per cent of patients attending A&amp;E should be admitted, transferred or discharged within four hours.</p>
      <p>Hospital bosses in Shropshire say there has been increasing demand on the emergency departments at Royal Shrewsbury Hospital and Telford's Princess Royal Hospital month after month.</p>
      <p>Kishan Devani, the Liberal Democrat parliamentary candidate for Montgomeryshire, says that despite healthcare being a devolved issue in Wales, the majority of Montgomeryshire residents receive urgent treatment on the English side of the border, meaning Montgomeryshire residents are still suffering.</p>
      <p>He said: “It is shameful that patients in Shropshire and Mid Wales are being abandoned, be it waiting for hours for treatment in A&amp;E or for months in pain for routine operations.</p>
      <p>“These figures reveal the Conservatives’ dismal record on the NHS.</p>
      <h3>'Extreme'</h3>
      <p>"For the past four years the Tories have utterly failed to invest properly in our health service, leaving local hospitals underfunded, overstretched and understaffed.</p>
      <p>“Their extreme Brexit would make a dismal situation worse by driving away the EU nurses the NHS desperately needs.</p>
      <p>“The Liberal Democrats will stop Brexit and build a brighter future.</p>
      <p>"We will invest an extra £35 billion in our NHS through a penny on income tax and develop a national recruitment strategy to ensure we never again suffer shortages of nurses, doctors and other health professionals and rely less on overseas workers going forward.”</p>
      <p>Nigel Lee, chief operating officer at The Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust, which runs RSH and PRH, said throughout the whole of October, the trust saw 12,399 emergency attendances – 1,135 more than in October 2018 – with 3,985 ambulance arrivals – 621 more than this time last year.</p>
      <p>It was the equivalent of 37 more people and 20 more ambulances every day.</p>
      <p>Mr Lee said the rise in emergency demand had continued into November.</p>
      <p>Across England, figures show some 83.6 per cent of patients arriving at A&amp;E were treated or admitted in four hours during October.</p>
      <p>The target of 95 per cent has not been met since July 2015.</p>
