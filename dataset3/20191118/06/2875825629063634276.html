      <h1>Glenn Whelan insists tonight won't his last Ireland game - regardless of result</h1>
      <h2>Until about a year ago, Whelan feared the game thrill was a thing of the past</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T06:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Paul O'Hehir</a></address>
      <p>Glenn Whelan's international career was prematurely written off once before. And whatever happens tonight, this won’t be his last game either.</p>
      <p>Beat Denmark and he will play at the Euros next summer. Any other result and he will be playoff bound in March.</p>
      <p>Mick McCarthy wouldn’t have it any other way for one of his most trusted lieutenants who is ringing every last drop out of his green shirt the second time around.</p>
      <p>But last night, Whelan still acknowledged: “With the young lads we have coming through and the talent we have, this is the be all and end all for me.</p>
      <p>“If I can qualify and go out on a high note in the summer that will be great, but I’m not looking anywhere other than Denmark.”</p>
      <p>Whelan, 35, has faced into these big November nights in the past, of course.</p>
      <p>He revelled in the highs of playoff wins over Estonia and Bosnia. He also shared in the despair of infamous playoff defeats to France and Denmark.</p>
      <p>And memories of those encounters have been a talking point amongst the players in the team hotel this week as they chance victory and reward tonight.</p>
      <p>Midfielder general Whelan said: “We’ve been talking about the good times, the nights we got the fans behind us and when the stadium was rocking.</p>
      <p>“A few of the lads have not been involved in nights like that, so this is the most important game they will have played for Ireland.</p>
      <p>“There have been a few shouts of ‘go and make a name for yourself’ and there are players in our squad who can do that tonight.</p>
      <p>“These are the nights you want to be involved in. Please God this will be another one. We don’t go into any game feeling scared, or thinking we can’t get a result.”</p>
      <p>But until McCarthy arrived back on the scene a year ago, Whelan feared the game thrill was a thing of the past.</p>

      <p>In the wake of the horrorshow to the Danes two years ago, he was frozen out of the international picture by Martin O’Neill.</p>
      <p>He was briefly brought in from the cold last November for a friendly against Northern Ireland in which he was made captain.</p>
      <p>It was billed as his farewell, although Whelan stressed throughout that particular week that he would never retire from international football.</p>
      <p>Clearly, retirement was being forced upon him. He certainly wasn’t consciously packing in a decade long love affair with the green shirt.</p>
      <p>Whelan said: “You think it's been taken away from you, that you're never going to wear the jersey again, to get a second chance, a second bite of the bullet.</p>
      <p>“There were two times where myself and Martin clashed, really clashed. But off the pitch he's the manager and he wins. We shook hands and got on with it.”</p>
      <p>That drab draw with the North just happened to be O’Neill’s penultimate game. Fast forward 12 months and Whelan is one of McCarthy’s most trusted lieutenants.</p>
      <p>Asked if McCarthy had repairs to carry out after the O’Neill-Roy Keane era, Wheland said: “We’re not children, no.</p>

      <p>“Martin had a go, Roy had a go, Mick has a go too. Martin and Roy had a way of doing things, discipline that hey were on top of.</p>
      <p>“But it’s down to performances and results. It didn’t happen for them in the Nations League and that’s why there was a change.</p>
      <p>“But confrontations happen all the time and Mick and his staff are no different. You only have to look at Mick on the sidelines, he’s a bit of a mad man!</p>
      <p>Whelan continued: “Black is black and white is white with him. The lads really appreciated him coming in and stripping everything back.</p>
      <p>“He has given the lads a lift. There were a few lads who were really low after the Nations League.</p>
      <p>“Not because of Martin, but because of the way results had gone and their own performances.</p>
      <p>“Mick has kept everything simple. He knows what he wants and it’s not rocket science.</p>
      <p>“We got a bit leaky at times come the end of the Nations League, conceding a lot of goals and he has steadied the ship.</p>
      <p>“We know we need to let the reins off a little to attack and score more goals but defensively he's come in and improved on that.”</p>
      <p>And Whelan added: “We’re one game away and Mick has given us something to fight for.”</p>
