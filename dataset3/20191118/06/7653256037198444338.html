      <p>SINGAPORE: Fund manager JP Morgan Asset Management upgraded its outlook on <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/global-stocks">global stocks</a> on Monday, pointing to hopes for a breakthrough in Sino-US trade talks, a reduced risk of a <a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/topic/US-recession">US recession</a> and a moderately positive earnings outlook.</p>
      <p>The call, from the manager of $1.8 trillion in assets, comes as US stock markets sit at a record high, but as a recent bond rally shows signs of unwinding.</p>
      <p>"We have held a cautious view on the outlook for equity markets for much of this year... however, the environment has shifted in recent weeks" said Patrik Schowitz, global multi-asset strategist at the fund manager in an emailed note.</p>
      <p>"That change likely reflects several factors, which we think has some more room to run," he added.</p>
      <p>Schowitz cited renewed optimism on China and the United States reaching a deal to end their damaging trade dispute, recession risk in the US dropping from an even chance to 20-30 per cent and the possibility of earnings growth as the main factors. He did not specify how the upgrade would affect asset allocation nor offer target levels for equity indicies.</p>
      <p>"Emerging market equities are now our most favoured region alongside US large cap equities, which we believe can do relatively well under a range of scenarios," he said. "Our least preferred markets are Australia and US small cap equities."</p>
      <p>Asian shares ticked higher on Monday after Beijing surprised markets by trimming a key interest rate for the first time since 2015, stirring speculation that further stimulus was on the way for the world's second-largest economy.</p>
