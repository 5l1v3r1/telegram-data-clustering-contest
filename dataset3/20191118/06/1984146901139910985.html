      <p>A thug attacked his ex partner when she told him she never wanted to see him again when he turned up drunk after a wake.</p>
      <p>David Groves was already on a suspended prison sentence for attacking another former partner when he lashed out again.</p>
      <p>A court heard the 34-year-old had been allowed to get showered and changed at the home of his recent ex that day as he had to attend the funeral of a close family member.</p>
      <p>But <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-crown-court">Newcastle Crown Court</a> heard he returned to the house "drunk" later that night and, after he smashed a glass over his own head, was asked to leave.</p>
      <p>Prosecutor Kevin Wardlaw said it was when victim told Groves she "never wanted to see him again" that he lashed out.</p>
      <p>Mr Wardlaw added: "This agitated the defendant, at which point he swung a blow with an open hand which collided with her nose, causing injury."</p>
      <p>The court heard the woman's nose was left cut and swollen from the attack. </p>
      <p>She said in a victim impact statement: "I have never seen this side of him. I am terrified of what he will do next."</p>
      <p>Mr Wardlaw said Groves was bleeding after the violence as a result of his own injury, which he caused with the glass.</p>
      <p>While at the police station he spat blood at an officer, who was left "disgusted" and worried about health implications for himself.</p>
      <p>Groves, of Maple Street, Ashington, admitted assault, assault on an emergency worker and possession of a small amount of cannabis.</p>
      <p>Recorder David Gordon sentenced him to a total of 14 months behind bars with a ten year restraining order to keep him away from the victim. </p>
      <p>The judge told him: "By committing these offences you are in breach of a suspended sentence order imposed in February for offences of criminal damage and battery, committed against a former partner. </p>
      <p>"There are features common between what you did to her and what you did in the present case."</p>
      <p>The judge said Groves poses a "high risk of serious harm" to people known to him.</p>
      <p>Andrew Walker, defending, said Groves had stayed away from alcohol for two months before the offence and added: "The funeral was that day. As is often the case, there was the presence of a lot of alcohol. </p>
      <p>"To his great regret, a single drink led to more and he finds himself back before the courts."</p>
      <p>Mr Walker said Groves has completed courses in custody in a bid to have a more positive future.</p>
