      <p>A mum left scarred for life in a doorstep <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/acid-attacks">acid attack</a> was targeted again just months later as thugs rammed into her car and attacked her partner.</p>
      <p>Theresa Townsley, 38, suffered serious burns to her face and neck when she was splashed with acid at her Edinburgh home in November 2018.</p>
      <p>It has now emerged that Ms Townsley feared she was going to die when her car was rammed repeatedly by a pick-up truck and a man battered the windows with a scythe, the <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/doorstep-acid-attack-mum-targeted-20900788">Daily Record</a> reports.</p>
      <p>Her partner, James Wilson, needed more than 40 stitches after being hit on the head with a spade in a row over a £13,000 car, a court heard.</p>

      <p>Last week, violent Alexander Burke and his son, Alexander Burke Jnr, were jailed at Hamilton Sheriff Court for assaulting Ms Townsley, Mr Wilson and her sister in Lanarkshire in May.</p>
      <p>There was no suggestion that incident was linked to the acid attack.</p>
      <p>Ms Townsley, who has moved away from Edinburgh since the acid attack, told the court that Burke, 48, owed her partner £13,000 for a Ford Transit truck, so they went to meet him in Strathclyde Park.</p>
      <p>But violence erupted when Burke, his son and other men arrived.</p>

      <p>Ms Townsley fled the scene with her sister, Mary Jean, but her vehicle was rammed by a pick-up at a motorway junction.</p>
      <p>Burke Jnr, 28, jumped out and hit the car windows with a scythe.</p>
      <p>Ms Townsley told the jury as she wept: “He put the scythe through the passenger side window and tried to cut me.</p>
      <p>“He was saying ‘You’re dead, you’re dead’. We thought we were going to die.</p>

      <p>Burke Jnr was jailed for three years after being found guilty of assaulting Mr Wilson, who was left with permanently disfigured.</p>
      <p>He was also found guilty of assaulting Ms Townsley and her sister.</p>
      <p>Burke Snr was found guilty of the attack on the sisters and jailed for two years.</p>

      <p>The court appearance came a year after Ms Townsley's was attacked on her doorstep in the Gracemount area of Edinburgh.</p>
      <p>A hooded man threw acid over her when she answered the door.</p>
      <p>No-one has been brought to justice over the attack.</p>
      <p>In a statement earlier this month, Ms Townsley said: "It was the worst day of my life and today (the one-year anniversary, on November 9) is the second worst as it brings it all back.</p>
      <p>“Day to day it is still hard, just to go out of the house, to look in the mirror.</p>
      <p>“Most of the time I am confined to the house.</p>
      <p>“I am scarred for life. People coming forward with information could prevent someone else suffering as I have.”</p>
