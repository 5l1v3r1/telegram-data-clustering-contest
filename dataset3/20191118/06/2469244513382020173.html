      <p>More than 45,000 properties in <a href="https://www.devonlive.com/news/devon-news/">Devon</a> are at medium or high risk of being flooded.</p>
      <p>That’s according to the latest figures from an Environment Agency database.</p>
      <p>The figures - updated last month - show that 18,203 properties in Devon postcodes are at a high long term risk - meaning there is a one in 30 chance or higher that they will be flooded within a year.</p>
      <p>Of those, 50% (9,155) are residential properties.</p>
      <p>A further 26,965 properties are considered to be at medium risk - meaning there is a chance of between one in 30 and one in 100 that they will experience flooding each year.</p>

      <p>The postcode unit with the highest proportion of high risk properties is EX8 1R in East Devon.</p>
      <p>Some 269 properties there have a high risk of flooding - 100% of the total.</p>
      <p>That was followed by EX34 8Q (16 of 16 properties at high risk), and EX8 1S (528 of 532 properties).</p>
      <p>That's looking at postcodes with 10 or more properties.</p>
      <p>Despite numbering in the thousands, medium and high flood risk only applies to 5% of all properties in Devon, and 5% of residential properties.</p>
      <p>You can check whether your property is among those at long term risk using the government's online tool here:  <a href="https://flood-warning-information.service.gov.uk/long-term-flood-risk">https://flood-warning-information.service.gov.uk/long-term-flood-risk</a></p>
      <h3>How many floods were there last year?</h3>

      </figure>
      <p>Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service attended 186 incidents of flooding in 2018/19.</p>
      <p>That compares to 344 the year before.</p>
      <p>Not all flooding incidents attended by fire crews are caused by the weather.</p>
      <p>While many will be due to storms and heavy rain, some might be caused by burst water mains and properties where people have accidentally left taps running.</p>
      <p>In England as a whole, the figure fell from 15,670 flooding incidents to 13,360 in 2018/19.</p>
      <h3>What is the current situation?</h3>

      <p>As of 2pm on Sunday (November 17) 59 flood warnings were in force - meaning flooding is expected - and there were 90 flood alerts in areas across the country.</p>
      <p>A flood alert means that people should be prepared for the possibility of flooding.</p>
