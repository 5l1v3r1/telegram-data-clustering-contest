      <h1>Ireland skipper Duffy not expecting to deliver inspirational speech ahead of Denmark clash</h1>
      <h2>It was yesterday morning that McCarthy took him aside and handed him the captaincy for the first time</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T06:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/michael-scully/" target="_blank">Michael Scully</a></address>
      <p>Shane Duffy doesn't expect to turn into Superman on the pitch tonight as Ireland's latest skipper - or that he'll have to deliver an inspirational dressing-room speech beforehand.</p>
      <p>It was yesterday morning, on his way to Abbotstown, that Mick McCarthy took him aside and handed him the captaincy for the first time for the crucial clash with Denmark.</p>
      <p>"It hasn’t really sunk in yet," said Duffy. "It’s a huge honour and something to be excited about.</p>
      <p>"I can’t let it really affect me - just come on, be the same and just take it in my stride, really.</p>
      <p>"If I didn’t have the armband on, I’d class myself as a leader anyway in the changing room.</p>
      <p>“It’s football, it’s part of it. I don’t think he would have given me it if I wasn’t ready for it.</p>
      <p>“He knows me and hopefully I can take it all in my stride. I’m excited, but probably my family are more excited than me.</p>
      <p>“It’s another game for me and if I didn’t have the armband I’d still be the same sort of leader - I’d throw my body on the line and hopefully try to get a goal for the lads, if we need it.</p>
      <p>"But I don’t think I can change much anyway - don’t expect me to run through 10 players!"</p>

      <p>Duffy finished the World Cup qualifying play-off against tonight's opponents as captain two years ago but this is the first time he'll wear the armband from the start.</p>
      <p>He previously skippered the Ireland under-21s, and, at club level, he led out  Blackurn Rovers and has led out Brighton.</p>
      <p>As for having to say something special before kick-off, Duffy believes that won't be necessary given what's at stake.</p>
      <p>“I don’t think so, no," he said. "If you look at the team, there is a lot of experience there now.</p>
      <p>“They don’t need me telling them that this is a big game. I think everyone knows.</p>
      <p>“It’s just maybe little details, making sure everyone is switched on, stuff like that, and making sure we're ready and we know what we're in for.</p>
      <p>“We stick together out there, no matter if someone is having a bad game or if someone is making a mistake - you just pick them up off the floor.</p>
      <p>“That’s what I do when I don’t have the armband".</p>
