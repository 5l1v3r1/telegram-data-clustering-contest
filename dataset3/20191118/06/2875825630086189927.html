      <h1>David McGoldrick makes Ireland a better team when he's involved says Mick McCarthy</h1>
      <h2>The Sheffield United forward missed last month’s games against Georgia and Switzerland with injury</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T06:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Paul O'Hehir</a></address>
      <p>David McGoldrick returns to lead the line tonight and Mick McCarthy is convinced Ireland are a better team with him involved.</p>
      <p>The Sheffield United forward, 31, missed last month’s games against Georgia and Switzerland because of a groin injury.</p>
      <p>James Collins started in Tbilisi and Geneva but was unable to make a serious impact in either game.</p>
      <p>Aaron Connolly caught the eye off the bench in Georgia and could have won it late on, but then struggled on his first start away to the Swiss days later.</p>
      <p>As it happens, Brighton starlet Connolly is injured for tonight’s Danish showdown and the spotlight returns to McGoldrick, who is a confirmed starter.</p>
      <p>He only has one international goal to his name - at home to the Swiss in September - but has arguably been Ireland’s most impressive performer in this campaign.</p>
      <p>‘Didsy’’ played under McCarthy at Ipswich, so little wonder the Ireland boss is such a fan but he believes the team functions better with him in it.</p>

      <p>"We play better - and I'm not being disrespectful to the lads we've got - but he's the best centre forward that we have at this moment in time,” said McCarthy.</p>
      <p>“He's playing well for his club and it's beneficial to us to have him in the team and we can play better off him."</p>
      <p>McCarthy continued: “There might be others who end up as good as him. Troy (Parrott) might end up as good as him. He’s not at the moment.</p>
      <p>“Didsy is a really good technical player and aligns that with hard work and determination.</p>
      <p>“All of a sudden he’s become one of the star performers. Having him back is a real boost. “</p>
      <p>McGoldrick has attributed his upturn in fortunes to a happier home life. He no longer has a 200-mile round trip between Ipswich and Nottingham to see his family.</p>
      <p>McCarthy continued: “He’s now living in Nottingham with his family and I can testify that when you’re around your kids all the time, you’re a lot happier.”</p>
