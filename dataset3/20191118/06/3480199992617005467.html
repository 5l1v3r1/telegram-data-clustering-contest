      <p>Neil Roberts, who is junior sous chef at Mercure Shrewsbury Albrighton Hall Hotel and Spa, said he had an "amazing experience" reaching the quarter finals of the hit TV show.</p>
      <p>The 20-year-old, who lives in Wales, said he entered the competition on a whim and thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience.</p>
      <p>His father and great-grandfather were both chefs, and he said: “It runs in my blood. Ever since I started school, being a chef was all I could ever see myself doing.</p>
      <p>He said about competing on the show: “It was the most pressure I have ever been under. I did not realise how much pressure it would be.</p>
      <p>“But the experience of working with different chefs and the feedback from such well-known judges has been absolutely incredible.</p>
      <h3>Amazing</h3>
      <p>“Doing something like this means putting your reputation on the line. Doing it so early in my career meant I had nothing to lose really, so there was no better time to do it.</p>
      <p>“It is a massive judge of character and was an amazing experience.”</p>
      <p>Neil finished school at 16 and started an apprenticeship. He worked in a small country house hotel in Wales, where the head chef had a big influence on him, and even went on to work in Melbourne, Australia for six months at a restaurant that is regularly named amongst the top ten in the country.</p>
      <p>Jennifer Sibbald-Wall, manager of the Albrighton Hall Hotel and Spa, said: “We are all extremely proud of Neil.</p>
      <p>“I think nerves may have got the better of him in the end, but he is only 20 and I have no doubt that he is definitely one to watch for the future."</p>
