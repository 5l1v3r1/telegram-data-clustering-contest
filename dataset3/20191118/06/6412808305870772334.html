      <p>In collaboration with <b>Incheon Tourism Organization</b> and <b>Gangwon Province Tourism</b>, we did some pretty cool activities during our stay. Lasting eight days, we traveled through the metropolitan city of Incheon and explored the vast natural beauty of Gangwon Province.<br/><br/>To say the trip was fun is a severe understatement. We got to experience seven full days of jam-packed excitement, thrill, and relaxation!</p>
      <h4>This was our 7D6N itinerary:</h4>
      <h4>Day 1 - Incheon, South Korea</h4>

      </figure>
      <p>After landing at Incheon International Airport, we headed straight to our first activity of the trip - <b>Mega Luge at Ganghwa Seaside Resort</b>! <br/><br/>Featuring the <b>largest luge circuit in Asia</b>, Mega Luge is definitely a stop to make when you fly to Incheon.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://images.says.com/uploads/story_source/source_image/736779/76f3.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>In order to reach Mega Luge, you've gotta take a short cable car ride up the hill. This won't break the bank, and you'll definitely get some super pretty views on your way up! The journey from Incheon International Airport will take you around two hours by bus, but the thrill you'll be experiencing at Mega Luge is totally worth it. <br/><br/>Even though you're not allowed to film or photograph your journey down the luge circuit (for safety reasons), there are multiple 'Photo Zones' along the track. Once you reach the bottom, you can choose to purchase a photo of your journey and forever immortalise whatever unglam face* you made as you raced toward the end! ;D<br/><br/><i>*I was so excited to purchase my photo, only to realise I looked like the Grinch.</i></p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://images.says.com/uploads/story_source/source_image/736770/c468.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>There are two tracks to choose from - fast (5-6 minute journey) and slow (9-10 minute journey). If you want to take it easy and enjoy the cool mountain air, it's highly suggested that you take the slow track. If you're looking for that insane adrenaline rush, we don't need to tell you which track to take. ;)<br/><br/><b><u>Here are the details:</u></b><br/><b>Opening hours:</b> Summer - 9am to 9pm, Winter - 9am - 6pm<br/><b>Address:</b> 4-15, Seondu-ri, Gilsang-myeon, Ganghwa-gun, Incheon<br/><b>Admission:</b> 12,000 Won (~RM43) for individuals &amp; 11,000 Won (~RM40) per person in a group of 20<br/><br/><a href="https://www.ganghwa-resort.co.kr/Reservation/Guide1.aspx">Click here</a> for more details.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Cotton was a ubiquitous material when it came to Korean clothing in the 50s and 60s. Sochang cotton as it's known, was hailed as the highest quality cotton one could get, due largely in part to its level of purity.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://images.says.com/uploads/story_source/source_image/736851/7ce4.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The Sochang Experience Center is a stop for those who want to gain an appreciation for the once-booming textile industry in Ganghwa. Since the development of newer, stronger materials, the Songcha cotton industry slowly declined, leaving only 10 factories still producing the pure cotton today. Not only is it rare, it's a specialised craft as well. <br/><br/>You can also come to the Sochang Experience Center for other relaxing activities, like taking part in a traditional tea ceremony and decorating your very own Sochang cotton handkerchief.</p>

          <b>Getting lost in Joyangbangjik Cafe, a former-textile-factory-turned-coffee-shop</b>
        </u>
      </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://images.says.com/uploads/story_source/source_image/736857/37b0.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Located in Ganghwa, Joyangbangjik Café was built in 1933 and served as one of the largest textile factories in the city. Following the decline of the textile industry, the factory closed down. <br/><br/>Earlier this year, it reopened as a café, gallery, and art space. You can even find old antiques of all kinds here, like pool tables, rotary telephones, vintage toys, leather barber chairs, and much more scattered throughout the premises.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://images.says.com/uploads/story_source/source_image/736860/7e3c.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>Other than the coffee (which was great, by the way), I tried out their famous carrot cake. It was so moist, with just the right amount of sugar. A damn good treat for sure.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://images.says.com/uploads/story_source/source_image/736862/35b7.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>You won't just find cool trinkets on the inside. Step outside of the café and you'll be greeted by a tonne of other old and rustic ephemera, like vintage table setups, telephone booths, and even an old tractor. </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://images.says.com/uploads/story_source/source_image/736864/9953.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>It truly is great to see an old, historical landmark given new life. The Joyangbangjik Café is one of the most unique places you'll ever come across, and is definitely a must-see. <br/><br/><b><u>Here are the details:</u></b><br/><b>Opening hours:</b> 11am to 9pm daily<br/><b>Address:</b> 12 Hyangnamu-gil 5 beon-gil, Ganghwa-eup, Ganghwa-gun, Incheon<br/><b>Admission:</b> Free, but you gotta pay for coffee of course!</p>
      <h4>Day 2 - Incheon, South Korea</h4>
      <p>
        <b>
          <u>Ditching a map in Chinatown</u>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>I bet you're wondering why the heck I'm telling you to visit Chinatown in Korea. It's simple, really - awesome photos and delicious food. <br/><br/>Lined with various eateries offering both Chinese and Korean fare, you're going to find it difficult to stop eating, seriously. To add to that, Incheon's Chinatown is the birthplace of jjajangmyeon<i>, </i>a hugely popular noodle dish. I can't stop drooling.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://images.says.com/uploads/story_source/source_image/736869/de92.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>The main entrance to Chinatown is an awesome photo opportunity in itself, especially when you have less people (usually in the morning) crowding up the shot. In addition to the traditional food stalls and restaurants, you'll find a lot of souvenir shops, places selling cute socks, and cozy little cafés strewn about the area. </p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://images.says.com/uploads/story_source/source_image/736871/a218.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>I recommend ditching a map and just going where your nose and eyes take you. It's pretty hard to get lost here, since the area is laid out in a grid system. You'll find cute surprises when you venture into tiny alleyways, like bright and colourful houses (pictured above) and even antique stores.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://images.says.com/uploads/story_source/source_image/736873/4c96.jpg"/>

      <p> </p>

        <figcaption>Tiny fishies!</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Just a four-minute bus ride from Chinatown, the Songwol-dong Fairy Tale Village is one of the hottest photo spots in Incheon, due to the amount of colourful houses there, along with mural depictions of various fairy tales.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://images.says.com/uploads/story_source/source_image/737184/b169.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>It was originally a booming neighbourhood back then, but as the residents grew older, and as the younger ones moved out, it slowly started to lose its appeal. <br/><br/>That is, until the government decided to give new life to the place by having artists decorate the entire neighbourhood with murals and quirky statues.﻿</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://images.says.com/uploads/story_source/source_image/737207/a1e4.jpg"/>

      </figure>
      <p>Though not technically an island, Wolmido is a super sweet tourist enclave lined with lots of restaurants serving up delicious, fresh-caught seafood. You can also catch the Wolmi Sea Train, which is a two-car train that runs on a 6.1km track. It's called a 'Sea Train' because the track itself straddles the coast line of Wolmido, with one side facing the sea.</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://images.says.com/uploads/story_source/source_image/736876/aa09.jpg"/>
        <figcaption>Corndogs, yum. :P</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>Wolmido is the perfect place to just sit back in a nice coffee shop and people-watch. With your typical carnival-type atmosphere, it's also a great place to bring the kids to. <br/><br/>I recommend having lunch at any of the seafood restaurants there, because the food is guaranteed fresh. If you're up for a snack, there are a ton of street food stalls scattered about just so you can satiate that craving of yours after watching a <i>mukbang</i> video (lol). </p>

          <u>Taking the Chuncheon Foreign Tourist Taxi</u>

        <figcaption>I was Group Leader, which means I had to pose with the driver for a photo. :D</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>The Chuncheon Foreign Tourist Taxi is a chartered taxi service which brings foreign tourists around to major hotspots in a hop-on/hop-off style. <br/><br/>The base fare is about 20,000 Korean Won, or roughly RM70. That'll last three hours, and the drivers will bring you to a different spot every hour. If you feel like you wanna spend a little more time, say, an hour more, you can just 'top up' and pay an extra 10,000 Korean Won (~RM36). :)</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="https://images.says.com/uploads/story_source/source_image/738348/6acf.jpg"/>
      </figure>
      <p>As the tag above says, the Foreign Tourist Taxi really is an easy way to enjoy Chuncheon. Not only do you get to enjoy the views while transiting to each hotspot, you'll also get to relax and enjoy the super-comfortable rides! <br/><br/>Unlike regular taxis, the Foreign Tourist Taxi lets you sit in a super-slick executive sedan. If you've got heavy bags that you won't necessarily be needing to bring to every single stop, you can just leave them in the taxi. The drivers are extremely friendly, approachable, and can understand English. </p>

      <p>The Soyanggang Skywalk is a glass walkway that allows visitors to 'walk over water' due to the transparent panels that make up its floor. Reaching 150 metres in length, you'll get amazing 360º views of Uiamho Lake with people on cute little paddle boats and even speedboats! </p>

      <p>Located in the Sinbuk area of Chuncheon, the Organic Farming Cafe is an ABSOLUTE MUST VISIT if you're ever around the area. The cafe itself serves homemade drinks made from local, organic produce, making it a great spot to just soak in the wonderful, expansive views of farmland.</p>

      </figure>
      <p>The best part about this cafe is perhaps what's next to it - a field of <b>pink muhly grass</b>!﻿ You'll only be able to see the pink muhly during Fall. When it's Spring, you'll get to see a field of canola flowers instead. Of course, if you want to have the best experience, the pink muhly season is the best time to come. Do make sure to plan strategically, though. It can get super crowded!</p>

      </figure>
      <p>Just further down the road from the dam is a jetty from which you can set off on a 10-minute ride to the foot of Obongsan Mountain. From there you'll be able to hike up to Cheongpyeongsa Temple. <br/><br/>Be careful, though. The hike features a lot of steep inclines, and some sections of the trail aren't paved. It's highly recommended to bring comfortable walking shoes, since the journey to the top by foot will take about an hour. </p>

      <p>After a long hike up Obongsan Mountain, we rewarded ourselves with a hearty portion of dakgalbi. To say it was delicious would be a severe understatement. It's dakgalbi done right! <br/><br/>It wouldn't be fair to say that this was the best dakgalbi in town, since there are so many places that serve the dish. But it was certainly the best dakgalbi I've ever had in my entire life. :)</p>

Privately owned by a South Korean man, it's said that he planted all these Gingko trees on his land to help out his wife (who suffered from chronic indigestion) in her healing process. Talk about true love. <br/><br/>It was closed off to the public up until 2010, when the owner finally decided to let visitors in after the place had grown immensely popular through word-of-mouth. The best part is, admission is totally free!</p>

      <p>We were given special Gangwon-only coupons that resembled real Korean bank notes! But they aren't your run-of-the-mill cash vouchers. You can use it on literally anything in Jungang Market, and if you spent anything less than the value of the voucher, you get <b>REAL</b> cash change. Yaaas, don't mind if I do. ;D</p>

      <p>Croquettes are some of the most famous offerings in Jungang Market, coming in a variety of flavours. Being a true, red-hot Malaysian, I opted for the spicy chilli croquette. Don't let its relatively non-spicy look fool you. These things are hot AF, but seriously good. </p>

      <p>Made famous by BTS' 'You Never Walk Alone' album cover, the BTS Bus Stop is a must-stop (hehe) location when you're in Gangneung. After it grew more popular, the city of Gangneung designated it as an official tourist stop, allowing visitors to take photos at the iconic location. But once you're in Jumunjin Beach, the bus stop shouldn't be the only thing to look at!</p>

      <p>The beach itself is a sight to behold, and the small patches of forest beyond the sand make awesome photo spots when the sun is setting, as is evident above. ;)</p>

      <p>We headed to the Jumunjin Breakwater, location of the famous scene in the hit K-Drama Goblin, in which the Goblin met his bride for the first time. Of course, people flock to the breakwater to re-enact that scene, but since I'm just a bride-less Goblin, I stood there awkwardly. :)<br/><br/>Though it can get a little dicey when the waves hit the breakwater, you just gotta use common sense and be careful. </p>

      <p>A word of caution, do not sit on the rocks! Though they do make good photo opportunities, they can be quite dangerous due to the strong waves.

      <p>The city of Gangneung is <b>obsessed</b> with coffee. Anmok Coffee Street itself is lined with a ton of coffeeshops, including <b>Longbread Cafe</b> (above), facing Anmok Beach. It's super chill, and the interior of the cafe is designed to let as much light in as possible, evident with the giant circular opening on its front facade. </p>

      <p>The Hanbok is Korea's traditional costume, coming in all the colours of the rainbow. It's got a relatively slim top with a wide bottom, making a sort of bell shape. The Hanboks that we got to wear were pretty special though. They were ROYAL Hanboks, meaning, they were only worn by royalty and nobility back in the day. </p>

      <p>Formerly a bustling fishing town, Donghae now caters more towards domestic and international tourists with its many murals hidden in hillside paths and alleys. <br/><br/>The murals themselves are located in a little enclave called Nongoldamgil, and they tell the story of the town's history as a representative port for pollack and squid. It's a great place to just catch some fresh air, get coffee in one of the many cafes, and take lots of pretty ocean photos.</p>

      <p>On our last full day in Korea, we headed to the Goseong Unification Observatory in Sokcho. The place itself was built by a Korean army unit in 1983 and used as an observation post. Though there are many places observation decks along the border between the two Koreas, the Goseong Observatory is one of the most modern ones, complete with gift shop and a great view of some North Korean mountains. </p>
