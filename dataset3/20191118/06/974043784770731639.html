      <h1>It’s soon time to start scanning early-lambing flocks</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T06:20:53+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 06:20</time> by <a rel="author">Michael Geary</a></address>
      <p>The breeding season is coming to a close for many early-lambing flocks and, by now, many of these flocks will be housed for the winter period.</p>
      <p>The lambing season can be split up into three different periods: early; mid; and late season.</p>
      <p>Farmers who are lambing down early to produce lamb for the Easter market should be getting ready to scan their ewes and prepare themselves for the busy lambing period.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Ewes should be scanned between 80 and 90 days post ram turnout in order to achieve accurate results.</p>
      <hr/>
      <p>Scanning at 80 days will ensure that the scanner can pick up all of the ewes that are in-lamb.</p>
      <p>However, scanning ewes that are greater than 90 days in-lamb will make it more difficult for the scanner to identify how many lambs the ewe is carrying.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, it is best practice to avoid scanning ewes that are less than 40 days in-lamb as this will result in pregnant ewes not being identified and culled as they were considered empty.</p>
      <p>Ewes should be batched according to the number of lambs they are carrying and fed accordingly to meet energy requirements.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it is important that ewes are offered good-quality silage of at least 70% dry matter digestibility (DMD).</p>
      <p>Silage of low DMD (less than 65%) will result in twin-bearing ewes requiring concentrates 8-10 weeks before lambing. Farmers should get their forage tested to help ensure that accurate pre-lambing nutrition is achieved.</p>
      <h3>Benefits of scanning</h3>
      <p>There are many benefits to scanning ewes that farmers should take advantage of. Furthermore, after a difficult year in terms of sheep prices, farmers should be looking at ways to reducing costs, and scanning offers them this chance.</p>

      <p>
        <b>The benefits of scanning include:</b>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>It will identify empty ewes that can be culled and sold;</li>
        <li>It will give an indication to the number of lambs a ewe is carrying;</li>
        <li>Ewes can also be batched according to the number of lambs they are carrying;</li>
        <li>It will give farmers an idea of how much feed should be offered to ewes.</li>
      </ul>
