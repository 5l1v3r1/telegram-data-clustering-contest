      <h1>EUR/USD ready to rally to 1.1112 after impressive recovery – Confluence Detector</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T06:36:38+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 06:36</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.fxstreet.com/author/yohay-elam" target="_blank">Yohay Elam</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/currencies/eurusd">EUR/USD</a> has been recovering amid US Dollar weakness resulting from optimism on trade talks. The world's most popular currency pair enjoys significant support and already eyes the next levels.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/rates-charts/indicators">Technical Confluences Indicator</a> is showing that EUR/USD has a substantial cushion at <b>1.1049</b>, which is a dense cluster of lines including the Simple Moving Average 100-15m, the SMA 10-one-day, the Fibonacci 23.6% one-day, the Fibonacci 38.2% one-day, the Fibonacci 23.6% one-week, the Bollinger Band 1h-Middle, and more.</p>
      <p>Looking up, some resistance awaits at <b>1.1066</b>, which is the convergence of the SMA 5-4h, the BB 15min-Lower, and the SMA 5-15m. </p>
      <p>Higher, euro/dollar may target 1.1112, which is the confluence of the Fibonacci 23.6% one-month, the Pivot Point one-week Resistance 2, and the PP one-day R3. </p>
      <p>Below 1.1049, EUR/USD has several robust clusters of supports, with the most notable one awaiting at <b>1.0991</b>, which is the meeting point of the Fibonacci 161.8% one-day, the previous weekly low, and the Fibonacci 61.8% one-month. </p>
      <p>Here is how it looks on the tool:</p>

      <h3>Confluence Detector</h3>
      <p>The Confluence Detector finds exciting opportunities using Technical Confluences. The TC is a tool to locate and point out those price levels where there is a <b>congestion of indicators,</b> moving averages, <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/technical-analysis/support-resistance/fibonacci">Fibonacci levels</a>, Pivot Points, etc. Knowing where these congestion points are located is very useful for the trader, and can be used as a basis for different strategies.</p>
      <p>This tool assigns a certain amount of “weight” to each indicator, and this “weight” can influence adjacents price levels. These weightings mean that one <a href="https://www.fxstreet.com/cryptocurrencies/bitcoin">price level without any indicator</a> or moving average but under the influence of two “strongly weighted” levels accumulate more resistance than their neighbors. In these cases, the tool signals resistance in apparently empty areas.</p>
