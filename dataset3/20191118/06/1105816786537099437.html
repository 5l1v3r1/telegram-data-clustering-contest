      <h1>Nicolas Cage to play Nicolas Cage in a movie based on Nicolas Cage</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T06:03:54+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 06:03</time> by <a rel="author">https://tribune.com.pk/author/8823/asfa-sultantribune-com-pk/, Tribune.com.pk</a></address>
      <p>Nicolas Cage is reportedly in conversation to play himself, in a movie based on himself, quite similar to his character in the film who also struggle to land a Quentin Tarantino movie to revive his career.</p>
      <p>The film titled <i>Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent</i>, is currently underway for a final negotiation before being picked up by Lionsgate, according to <i><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/nicolas-cage-star-as-nicolas-cage-unbearable-weight-massive-talent-1254626">The Hollywood Reporter</a>.</i></p>
      <p>The film is written by Tom Gormican , the writer of <i>That Awkward Moment </i>and Kevin Etten, known for his, <i>Ghosted</i>, with the director being Gormican as well.</p>
      <p>The film would show Cage meeting up with an egotistical Nineties version of himself, who mocks his future self for not being famous, along with making too many low-budget films.</p>

      <p>His character will also be dealing with a considerable level of debt, following which he will agree to make an appearance at the birthday party of a Mexican billionaire drug cartel member, who is also his fan and wants him to see a film script he’s written.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Cage also has to try and keep his teenage daughter happy. The situation spirals even more dramatically when the billionaire brings over Cage’s daughter and his ex-wife for a reconciliation, and when their lives are on the line, Cage takes on the role of a lifetime.</p>
      <p>The project has tones of <i>Adaptation</i>, which starred Cage; Jean-Claude Van Damme’s meta movie <i>JCVD</i>; and the John Travolta Hollywood caper <i>Get Shorty</i>, among others.</p>
      <p>According to sources, the script was shown to Cage accompanied with a letter that Gormican wrote, pleading his case and saying how the piece was a love letter to the actor, not something that made fun of him. Cage was convinced and became attached only in recent weeks.</p>
      <p>According to <i>The Independent</i>, there is currently no indication as to whether other actors are being considering for the role of Nicolas Cage, other than Nicolas Cage himself</p>
