      <h3>Didier Drogba has urged Chelsea FC to keep tabs on Jamaican duo Kevon Lambert and Junior Flemmings with a view to potential transfers, according to reports in the British media.</h3>
      <p>Website <a href="https://www.teamtalk.com/news/exclusive-didier-drogba-urges-chelsea-to-track-jamaican-duo">TEAMtalk</a> is reporting that the Chelsea FC legend has instructed his former club to keep a close eye on the duo in the coming weeks and months.</p>
      <p>The pair both play in America for Phoenix Rising – the club Drogba is a co-owner of – and the former Ivory Coast international believes they could both have a future in England, according to the same story.</p>
      <p>The same story says that Drogba has asked Chelsea FC to take a look at the pair, and the likes of West Ham, Crystal Palace and Reading are also said to be keeping an eye on them.</p>
      <p>Striker Flemmings, 23, netted 23 goals last season, and midfielder Lambert is “highly regarded”, according to the same story.</p>
      <p>It remains to be seen whether Chelsea FC will be able to make any new signings in January as their Fifa transfer ban still applies as things stand.</p>
      <p>The Blues have been in fine form in recent weeks and have won all six of their last six games in the top flight to leave them third in the Premier League table.</p>
