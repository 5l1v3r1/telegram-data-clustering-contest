        <i>Confirmed case in autonomous region of Inner Mongolia comes after two cases in Beijing</i>
      </p>
      <p>China’s Inner Mongolia has reported a fresh, confirmed case of bubonic plague despite an earlier declaration by the country’s health officials that the risk of an outbreak was minimal.</p>
      <p>The health commission of the autonomous region said a 55-year-old man was diagnosed with the disease after he ate wild rabbit meat on 5 November.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/bubonic-plague">Bubonic plague</a> is the most common form of plague globally and can advance and spread to the lungs, becoming a more severe type called pneumonic plague, according to the World Health Organisation.</p>
      <p>The Inner Mongolia case follows two that were confirmed earlier this month in Beijing. In both cases, the two patients from Inner Mongolia were quarantined at a facility in the capital after being diagnosed with pneumonic plague, health authorities said at the time.</p>
      <p>The Inner Mongolia health commission said it found no evidence so far to link the most recent case to the earlier two cases in Beijing.</p>
      <p>The patient in Inner Mongolia is now isolated and treated at a hospital in Ulanqab, the health commission said.</p>
      <p>A total of 28 people who had close contact with the patient are now isolated and under observation, and the commission said there are no abnormal symptoms found in them.</p>
      <p>Outbreaks in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/china">China</a> have been rare, but large parts of the northwestern city of Yumen were sealed off in 2014 after a 38-year-old resident died of bubonic plague, known as Black Death in the Middle Ages and caused by the same bacterium as the pneumonic variant.</p>
      <p>Rodent populations have risen in Inner Mongolia after persistent droughts, worsened by climate change. An area the size of the Netherlands was hit by a “rat plague” last summer, causing damages of 600 million yuan ($86 million), Xinhua said.</p>
