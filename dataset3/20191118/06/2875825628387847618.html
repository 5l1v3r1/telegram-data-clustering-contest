      <h1>Shane Duffy not thinking about World Cup play-off defeat ahead of Denmark rematch</h1>
      <h2>It was the towering centre-half who rose to head home a sixth minute opener</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T06:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/michael-scully/" target="_blank">Michael Scully</a></address>
      <p>Shane Duffy has worn the armband for Ireland once before. It's not a good memory for the big Derry man.</p>
      <p>Two years and four days ago, it was the towering centre-half who rose to head home a sixth minute opener against Denmark in the World Cup play-off at the Aviva Stadium and Ireland were dreaming of Russia in the summer.</p>
      <p>By the time he was handed the captaincy, after David Meyler and then Ciaran Clark were substituted, Ireland were in serious trouble - 3-1 down and there were 19 minutes remaining.</p>
      <p>By the end, it was 5-1 and they were out.</p>
      <p>“You don’t want to think about it because it’s not nice to think about," said Duffy, reflecting on  that defeat on the eve of tonight's latest crunch Lansdowne Road encounter between the rivals.</p>
      <p>“But you still think about it where you can take things from that game and learn from it.</p>
      <p>“I don’t go around thinking, 'oh, they beat us 5-1'.  We’ve played them a few times since then. It’s long gone.</p>
      <p>"Obviously it was a low point in my career, my Ireland career.</p>
      <p>"But now we’ve got the (home) advantage to go and beat them and knock them out and that’s great motivation for us.</p>
      <p>"I wouldn’t call it revenge, it’s just the way it’s turned itself around. It’s ended up being this game again, it’s quite funny sometimes football.</p>
      <p>"But it can be a great night for us at the Aviva." </p>

      <p>Duffy believes Ireland panicked on the night after going 2-1 down after 32 minutes - and the fact that they had an hour left to rectify went out the window.</p>
      <p>"We left ourselves open and leaving that much space for (Christian) Eriksen, you could see his quality," said the 27-year-old.</p>
      <p>"Those are things you can learn from two years ago.</p>
      <p>"You’ve got to be patient, they’re a good team, they’re might be times when they’ve got the ball for a while and we’ve got to be compact and not open up, it’s a 90 minute game.</p>
      <p>"The manager says he wants to get after them, straight from the start, put them under pressure, make them make mistakes, not let them get comfortable - don’t let them in for an easy night." </p>
      <p>The Brighton defender is confident that much has changed since that fateful night with McCarthy succeeding Martin O'Neill, a different way of playing and more experienced personnel.</p>
      <p>That humiliation apart, Duffy is not impressed by the criticism the Danes have made of Ireland's playing style.</p>

      <p>But there's a more positive motivation that Duffy and his Ireland team-mates are feeding off going into this latest encounter with Age Hareide's side.</p>
      <p>With the multi-city format introduced by UEFA for next summer's finals, an Ireland victory would secure three home games on the big stage.</p>
      <p>"It’s every boy’s dream," Duffy smiled. "Imagine playing the Euros in your own country - it’s extra motivation as well, to get Dublin rocking.</p>
      <p>“You take it all on board but we're players and just try to keep calm.</p>
      <p>“We know we've got to go out and do the business, and let the talking take care of itself.</p>
      <p>“We sort of bubble it all up. You sort of dream 10 different dreams of scoring the winner and celebrating.</p>
      <p>"We all know how big the game is, and we're all excited.</p>
      <p>“It’s more excitement than anything, we know it’s going to be a nervy night and it’s going to be tight.</p>
      <p>“Four of the five games have been draws (since 2017 against the Danes), so there are no real surprises in what to expect.</p>
      <p>"We know it’s going to be cagey, but hopefully we’ll come out the right side - that we’re more prepared than them this time".</p>
