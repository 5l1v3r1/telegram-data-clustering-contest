      <h1>Where to find mental health support in Devon</h1>
      <h2>There are a number of groups around Devon offering help-in a variety of ways</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T06:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Charlotte Vowles</a></address>
      <p>Many of us will experience mental illness in our life time-either directly or through loved ones. Talking openly about mental health struggles can be incredibly difficult, and it can be hard to know where to go for support.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, there are many groups in <a href="https://www.devonlive.com/news/devon-news/">Devon</a> offering support to people struggling-often run by people with lived experience.</p>
      <p>Many of these groups offer support in lots of different ways, including help online and over the phone, with some offering a non-referral, drop-in option.</p>
      <p>Here are some of the places in Devon you can seek support for yourself or loved ones.</p>
