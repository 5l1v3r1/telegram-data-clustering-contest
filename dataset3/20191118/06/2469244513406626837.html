      <h1>Devon woman swapped the stage for business with veggie and vegan delivery service</h1>
      <h2>Belle had always wanted to start her own business, and now she's made her dream a reality</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T06:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Charlotte Turner</a></address>
      <p>A young woman from <a href="https://www.devonlive.com/all-about/torbay">Torquay </a>who shot to fame with a teen singing career has stepped away from the fast life to pursue her passion of food.</p>
      <p>Belle Carter made the move back to <a href="https://www.devonlive.com/news/devon-news/">Devon</a> after a music career which begun when she was discovered by a talent scout at the age of 13.</p>
      <p>Following her teens, in which bubbly Belle said her “feet didn’t touch the ground”, she moved around to London and Bristol before deciding to come back and start her own business.</p>
      <p>At first it was just an idea for the now 30-year-old to start a business of her own revolving around her love of food, but now she has conquered her doubts of success and is thriving.</p>

      <p>Belle set up the Cactus Kitchen in September 2018. Before that, her first real food showcase was when she shared a traders market stall in Totnes – and she sold out.</p>
      <p>Now, she’s so busy with order’s she’s thinking of setting up her own place.</p>
      <p>Food was always a big part of Belle’s life – her dad was a chef on super yachts and she could be found clutching a pot of olives and happily munching away at them from the age of one.</p>
      <p>The Cactus Kitchen, which is a vegetarian, vegan and gluten free lunch delivery service, is run solely by Belle, who rents out a commercial kitchen in Devon to whip up her tasty creations.</p>

      <p>She produces a new menu every week brimming with delights such as Mexican burritos, seitan kebabs, halloumi wraps, decadent side salads laced with feta, olives, homemade dressings and more, and she also makes her own cakes.</p>
      <p>She then does a round of lunch deliveries to businesses in Newton Abbot on Wednesdays, and Paignton and Torquay on Thursdays and Fridays.</p>
      <p>“I was the happiest person in the world when I realised it [the business] worked,” Belle said.</p>
      <p>“I had all these crazy thoughts that people wouldn’t like it or wouldn’t order.</p>

      <p>“On the first day I had 15 deliveries and I couldn’t believe it. I just cried, I was elated.</p>
      <p>“It was mostly to salons, friends and family to begin, but from there it just doubled and doubled.”</p>
      <p>As well as being signed to Mercury, Belle was also the face of Ripcurl; she still dabbles in music now, and she has a new single out on Spotify.</p>
      <p>But her main focus remains on her popular foodie business, which has a great social following and a very loyal customer base.</p>

      <p>Belle said her customers have even been approaching her to ask her when she’s going to open up a place in Torquay, which is her next aim.</p>
      <p>“I didn’t think this was all possible, I never thought I’d be in a position where I’d be looking at somewhere.</p>
      <p>“It would be amazing to have a small place and have deliveries based out of there, it’s really exciting and a cool thing to think I could have a table setting with food laid out.”</p>
      <p>Belle also serves up tasty creations for events and weddings and how now teamed up with the Curious Kitchen to host a two night supper club event.</p>
