      <h1>Facebook Touts Crypto Project Libra: 51,000 Transactions and Counting</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T06:45:47+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 06:45</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://dailyhodl.com/author/thedailyhodl/" target="_blank">Daily Hodl Staff</a></address>
      <p>Facebook’s project Libra is building a global community of developers and technical infrastructure as the controversial digital currency is underway, despite efforts by regulators to slow it down and even halt its launch. Based on a permissioned blockchain, unlike Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that use public blockchains, the Libra testnet has logged over 51,000 transactions since it was reset in September.</p>
      <p>After the Libra Association lost key member companies amid regulatory pressure and ominous letters from politicians that <a href="https://dailyhodl.com/2019/10/10/us-senators-send-ominous-letters-signaling-potential-liabilities-over-facebooks-crypto-project-libra/">cautioned against</a> any affiliation with the project, 21 remaining members, including Facebook, signed the association’s official charter in Geneva, Switzerland last month.</p>
      <p>The organization is now praising its passionate community of developers who are moving the project forward. According to an official blog post,</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Our community of developers has responded enthusiastically, logging an amazing 34 projects in just seven weeks since launch of the testnet:</i>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>10 wallets</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>11 blockchain explorers</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>2 IDEs</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>1 API</i>
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>11 clients”</i>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>According to Libra’s development <a href="https://developers.libra.org/blog/2019/10/02/libra-developer-update/?sf220613563=1">update</a> last month,</p>
      <p>
        <i>“Following the Testnet, we hope to have a successful launch of the Libra Mainnet. One method we use for tracking the project’s success is how many of the deployed nodes are managed by different partners.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>The end goal of Mainnet is for all partners to have nodes deployed on the network. Each node will run on a mixture of on-premises and cloud hosted infrastructure. Our belief is that wider diversity of infrastructure will provide more resiliency to the Libra network.”</i>
