      <p>At least four people were killed and six others were injured on Sunday evening after unknown gunmen opened fire at a backyard football viewing party in Fresno, California.</p>
      <p>Fresno Police say at least 10 people were shot just before 8 p.m. (11 p.m. ET) in the backyard of a home in southeast Fresno, according to <a href="https://www.fresnobee.com/news/local/article237473114.html">The Fresno Bee</a>. Police say the “unknown suspects” remain at large.</p>
      <p>All of the victims were “Asian males” between the ages of 25 and 30, police said.</p>
      <p>“What we do know is that this was a gathering, a family and friend gathering in the backyard,” Lieutenant Bill Dooley told a <a href="https://twitter.com/larryvalwork/status/1196285080399802368">press conference</a>, calling the event a “mass casualty shooting.”</p>
      <p>“Everyone was watching football this evening when unknown suspects approached the residence, snuck into the backyard and opened fire.”</p>

      <p>“We’re going to exhaust every investigative lead we can to find out who did this, why they did this, and bring those folks to justice,” Reid said.</p>
      <p>Earlier on Sunday, a <a href="https://www.fresnobee.com/news/local/crime/article237463449.html">man in his 20s was shot dead</a> in a southeast Fresno apartment complex. Neighbours reported that a party was being held at the time. According to the Fresno Bee, police have not yet said whether the incidents are connected.</p>
