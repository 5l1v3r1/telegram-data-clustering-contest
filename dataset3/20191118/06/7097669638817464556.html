      <p>What worries business the most: A large regulatory border between the U.K. and the European Union after Brexit or a Labour government led by Jeremy Corbyn? Those attending Monday’s Confederation of British Industry conference in London will get a taste of both options.</p>
      <p>Prime Minister Boris Johnson will address them first, offering an olive branch of tax cuts worth an estimated 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion) to make up for the disruption of Brexit. He’ll be followed by Corbyn, who is pledging to nationalize key industries if he wins power. Bloomberg Economics sees the election result as “critical” for the direction of the U.K. economy in 2020.</p>
      <p>A slew of Sunday polls looked good for Johnson, but this week sees two televised appearances alongside Corbyn. There’s still plenty that can go wrong.</p>
