      <p>Cape Town - Veteran prop <b>Jannie du Plessis</b> is in talks with the <b>Lions</b> ahead of the 2020 Super Rugby season.</p>
      <p>Afrikaans newspaper <b><a href="https://www.netwerk24.com/Sport/Rugby/jannie-en-carlu-kan-leeus-se-skrums-spierkrag-gee-20191116">Rapport</a></b> reported on Sunday that the 37-year-old was in discussions with the Lions about a surprise move to Johannesburg.</p>
      <p>Du Plessis, who played 70 Tests for the Springboks between 2007 and 2015, has been on the books of French club Montpellier since 2015.</p>
      <p>Before that, Du Plessis played 119 Super Rugby games for the Sharks between 2008 and 2015, having started his professional career at the Cheetahs in 2003.</p>
      <p>A medical doctor by trade, Du Plessis was largely expected to retire from rugby after his stay in France but a recent resurgence in form has breathed new life into his playing career.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the report added that the Lions were also in negotiations with Stormers prop <b>Carlu Sadie</b> about a permanent move to Johannesburg.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old joined the Lions on a loan deal for the 2019 Super Rugby season, but was ordered to return to play for Western Province in the Currie Cup.</p>
      <p>The Lions open their 2020 Super Rugby campaign against the Jaguares in Buenos Aires on February 1.</p>
