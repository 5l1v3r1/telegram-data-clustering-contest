      <h1>Barcelona’s Gerard Pique hints towards his retirement</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T06:21:25+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 06:21</time> by <a rel="author">Nishant Narayanan</a></address>
      <h3>Gerard Pique talks to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/16/gerard-pique-revamped-davis-cup-project"><b>Observer</b></a> about his future in Football and states he is uncertain about when he will retire from the sport.</h3>
      <p>Gerard Pique has had a busy week, firstly having played with Barcelona in a charity match [raising money for flood relief] against Cartagena in the Murcia region while keeping an eye on his global investment company, Kosmos Holding’s assets. He is also involved in his “Project of my life”, which is the partnership with the International Tennis Federation to transform the Davis Cup to a ‘world cup style’ format. The newly formed Kosmos Tennis pledged $3bn over 25 years last February to transform the oldest team event in international sports.</p>
      <p>The Blaugrana player’s interest in tennis is nothing new, having been both an accomplished tennis player and a promising footballer in his youth, but he later chose football as a career.</p>
      <blockquote>“I played both sports when I was young. I decided in the end on football. I think my decision wasn’t bad at all. I am very happy with the life I chose.</blockquote>
      <p>The 32-year-old continues to play the main center back for Barcelona, since the retirement of ex-captain Puyol. The defender will be celebrating his 33rd birthday on 2nd February next year getting him ever so closer to the end of his eminent career.</p>
      <p>The Spaniard continues to be a crucial player for Barcelona and has already signed a contract extension in 2018 that will see the player in a Barcelona shirt until 2022.</p>
      <p>Pique in a recent interview with the Observer has stated that he wants to end his career on a high note and meanwhile maintains his focus on playing his football with Barca.</p>
      <blockquote>“Right now my thoughts are that every year has to be my last year. I want to dedicate as much as I can to football.<br/><br/>“I want to end my career in the best way possible. I don’t know if it will be one more year, two more years, five more years. But I am happy at Barcelona.”</blockquote>
      <p>The Spanish international announces his retirement from the national squad in the summer of 2018 and has stated that he will decide to quit football the day he stops enjoying it.</p>
      <p>Who should Barcelona get to replace Gerard Pique?</p>
