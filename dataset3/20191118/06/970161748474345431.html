      <p>A gunman is on the loose after four people were shot dead and another six injured in a shooting in Fresno, California, last night.</p>
      <p>Three people died instantly and a fourth later died at hospital after unknown suspects sneaked into the garden where they were watching a football match.</p>
      <p>Police said the shooting took place at around 6pm last night and the people at the party were all family and friends.</p>
      <p>Deputy Chief Michael Reid said the six people who were injured are expected to survive and are recovering at the hospital.</p>
      <p>Fresno Police Lt Bill Dooley said: ‘What we do know is that this was a gathering, a family and friend gathering in the backyard.</p>

      <p>Others were taken to Community Regional Medical Center in critical condition, and some are in critical but stable condition, the TV stations reported.</p>
      <p>Agents from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives field office in San Francisco are responding to the shooting, the Bee reported.</p>
      <p>It was at least the second fatal gun attack Sunday in southeast Fresno, the Bee reported. A man in his 20s was shot to death early Sunday at a home in another part of the city.</p>
      <p>Police have not said whether the incidents could be connected but the hunt is still on for suspects.</p>
