      <h3>Bitcoin Price Analysis</h3>
      <p>After struggling to clear the $8,600 and $8,660 resistance levels, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/17/bitcoin-weekly-forecast-btc-price-turned-sell-on-rallies/">bitcoin declined once again</a> against the US Dollar. BTC broke the $8,500 support area and spiked below $8,400. However, the $8,375 region acted as a strong support.</p>
      <p>As a result, the price recovered above $8,500, but it failed to settle above $8,600 and the 100 hourly simple moving average. The last swing high was formed near $8,629 and the recent low was near the $8,419 level.</p>
      <p>At the outset, the price is currently consolidating above the $8,420 support area. Moreover, it is trading near the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the latest drop from the $8,629 high to $8,419 low.</p>
      <p>On the upside, there are many key resistances near the $8,600 area. An immediate resistance is near the $8,520 level since it coincides with the 50% 23.6% Fib retracement level of the latest drop from the $8,629 high to $8,419 low.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the 100 hourly simple moving average is also near the $8,520 level. More importantly, there is a major bearish trend line forming with resistance near $8,525 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair.</p>
      <p>Above the trend line, bitcoin price is likely to face another <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/2019/11/15/bitcoin-btc-recovering-but-is-this-real-correction/">strong resistance</a> near the $8,600 area. The next key resistance is near the $8,660 level, above which the price could start a decent recovery.</p>
      <p>Conversely, if the price fails to correct above $8,525 or $8,600, it might resume its decline. An initial support is near the $8,420 area. The next key support region is near the $8,375 level, below which the price is likely to test the $8,200 support area.</p>
