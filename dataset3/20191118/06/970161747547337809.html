      <p>Someone in the office is about to draw the short straw and become the poor sap that has to organise the Secret Santa.</p>
      <p>Now, most places put a cap on the amount you can spend – say £5 or £10 – on the gift you give to a random colleague.</p>
      <p>However, that does not stop people from getting <a href="https://metro.co.uk/tag/anxiety/">anxiety</a>, according to a psychology lecturer at the University of Salford.</p>
      <p>The anxiety is so bad that more than a third believe present-giving in the workplace – including for birthdays – should be scrapped altogether.</p>
      <p>Dr Ashley Weinberg says that the limit should be strictly enforced to stop people from feeling like they are being viewed as being ‘stingy’.</p>
      <p>He said: ‘If you’ve grown up in a world where social media is at your fingertips and those kinds of social judgements are being made fairly constantly, suddenly you’re even more aware of what others might be thinking.</p>

      <p>‘Naturally that’s going to spill over into all kinds of areas, particularly something that can be a social taboo when you think about maybe not giving, or maybe questioning why people are giving.</p>
      <p>‘I think there can be a bit of that and naturally it does lead to anxiety for a lot of people.’</p>

      <p>He told the Telegraph that people also feared ‘humiliation’ if their present was not liked by the recipient.</p>
      <p>A study by Jobsite found that younger people feel more judged for their level of expenditure and often spend more than they can afford.</p>
      <p>One in four workers aged between 23 and 38 said they felt angry as a result of being asked to contribute towards a whip-round because their financial situation was not being considered.</p>
      <p>Dr Weinberg’s suggests that people’s well-being should be prioritised ahead of giving presents in the office this Christmas.</p>
