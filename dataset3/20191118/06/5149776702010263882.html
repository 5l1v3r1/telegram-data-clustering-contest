      <p>The Victoria Bus Station will reopen on Monday (November 17) after work was carried out to solve electrical issues.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/politics">Nottingham City Council</a> confirmed the station's travel centre had closed because of a power outage.</p>
      <p>Engineers tried to resolve the issues but the station was closed over the weekend with buses diverted to other stops in the city.</p>
      <p>The station was also <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/victoria-bus-station-remains-closed-3546993">shut on Sunday (November 17)</a>.</p>
      <p>However, the city council tweeted to say the bus station would be open on Monday.</p>
      <p>It also confirmed the Queen's Drive Park and Ride - which has been closed for the past few days because of the bad weather - will also reopen on the same day.</p>

      <p>The council clarified in the tweet that a small number of spaces had been cordoned off because of standing water.</p>
      <p>It was the second time in as many weeks the park and ride was shut <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/news/nottingham-news/live-updates-major-warning-flooding-3519523">following the recent heavy downpours</a>.</p>
