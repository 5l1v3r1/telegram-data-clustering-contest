      <p>Paresh Jethawa, 57, of Crossgate Road, Woodside, Dudley, had been drinking at The Waterfront Inn, at The Waterfront, in Brierley Hill, when he started using offensive language on September 8.</p>
      <p>Staff member Reece Skinner recognised him as having been banned previously after a woman complained, Wolverhampton Crown Court was told.</p>
      <p>Jethawa approached one of the barmaids and pulled out the Taser, which crackled and lit up but wasn’t used, said Mr Edward Soulsby, prosecuting.</p>
      <p>Mr Skinner intervened and told him to put the item away, saying it was not “appropriate” but Jethawa became “irate”.</p>
      <p>He threatened to use the weapon, which he had put away, after gesturing to the staff member to go outside with him.</p>
      <h3>Disguised</h3>
      <p>Jethawa was later ushered out of the pub, with officers then stopping him on Cochrane Road, where the weapon – disguised as a torch – was found. Jethawa admitted it was a Taser, which he had bought from China.</p>
      <p>Mr Lennart Poulsen, defending, said Jethawa was remorseful and apologetic for his actions and had been drinking cider an hour before the incident.</p>
      <p>Drinking had been a “demon” in Jethawa's life, which he had tried unsuccessfully to tackle, Mr Poulsen added.</p>
      <p>Recorder James Smith said it was a “serious" case which passed the custodial threshold because of the weapon’s use in a public place. But, taking into account Jethawa's lack of previous convictions and good character, Recorder Smith suspended the sentence.</p>
      <p>Jethawa was sentenced to 12 months in prison, suspended for two years, for using a prohibited weapon and using threatening behaviour. He must also undertake rehabilitation for his drinking within 12 months.</p>
