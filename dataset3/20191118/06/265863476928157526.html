      <h1>Lisa Vanderpump Says She Thought Camille Grammer Was Done With RHOBH – She Was Surprised By Her Return!</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T06:57:07+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 06:57</time> by <a rel="author">Ashley Mitchell</a></address>
      <p>Not too long ago, Camille Grammer confirmed that she would be back to the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills in season 10 and it turns out that Lisa Vanderpump is very surprised by that decision. Apparently, the former OG was convinced Camille was ‘over it,’ but it doesn’t look like it!</p>
      <p>While Lisa is over RHOBH, that does not mean she will stop expressing her opinions on certain matters regarding the show, including Camille’s surprising return.</p>
      <p>While at the first edition of BravoCon, Lisa chatted with HollywoodLife, telling the site that ‘I thought that she was over [the show] last time, but I didn’t see the reunion. She seemed pretty pissed off. Listen, she’s got enough money. She doesn’t need to do it for that. If she’s doing it, she’s doing it [because] she wants to stay relevant in social media.’</p>
      <p>Vanderpump went on to assure fans that the two of them are still very close and that they talk ‘quite often.’</p>
      <p>After all, Camille and Lisa have known one another for almost ten years since they are both OGs of the popular show which launched back in 2010.</p>
      <p>Camille, however, left RHOBH after only two seasons after some serious controversy but she was still part of the show part-time in the seasons that followed.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, fans were really surprised to find out about her return since back in August, she revealed that she had not been asked back.</p>
      <p>‘I wasn’t asked back. It’s fine. I did my time on the show. And it’s Kyle [Richards]’ show,’ she tweeted.</p>
      <p>However, earlier this month, she announced: ‘I’m getting back in the game. Diamonds and drama.’</p>
      <p>About this, Lisa also told the news outlet that ‘If she’s not having a good time…then I wouldn’t do it. If she’s enjoying herself, then keep the party going.’</p>
