      <h2>After adding Huawei to an economic blacklist in May.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T06:57:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 06:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.itnews.com.au/author/david-shepardson-and-steve-holland-1460812" target="_blank">David Shepardson and Steve Holland</a></address>
      <p>The Trump administration is set to issue a two-week extension of a license allowing US companies to continue doing business with China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, two sources familiar with the deliberations said.</p>
      <p>The extension of around two weeks is far shorter than the prior 90-day extension and a longer extension is in the works but has not yet been finalized due to regulatory hurdles, said one source who was briefed on the matter.</p>
      <p>After adding Huawei to an economic blacklist in May citing national security concerns, the US Commerce Department has allowed it to purchase some American-made goods in a move aimed at minimizing disruption for its customers, many of which operate networks in rural America.</p>
      <p>The extension will be announced on Monday, when the earlier reprieve is set to expire, the sources said, declining to be identified as the extension has not been publicly announced.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for Huawei, the world's biggest maker of telecom network equipment, said the company does not comment on rumors and speculation. The Commerce Department declined to comment.</p>
      <p>Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told Fox Business Network on Friday that some rural carriers need the temporary licenses and are dependent on Huawei for 3G and 4G networks.</p>
      <p>"There are enough problems with telephone service in the rural communities - we donâ€™t want to knock them out. So, one of the main purposes of the temporary general licenses is to let those rural guys continue to operate," Ross said.</p>
      <p>The development comes amid discussions between the United States and China aimed at coming to an initial agreement to resolve a trade war that has lasted for over a year.</p>
      <p>In blacklisting Huawei, the US government said it had a "reasonable basis to conclude that Huawei is engaged in activities that are contrary to US national security or foreign policy interests". Huawei has repeatedly denied the accusations.</p>
      <p>Attorney General William Barr said on Thursday Huawei and ZTE Corp "cannot be trusted," as he backed a proposal to bar US rural wireless carriers from tapping an US$8.5 billion government fund to purchase equipment or services from them.</p>
      <p>In May, President Donald Trump also signed an executive order declaring a national emergency and barring US companies from using telecommunications equipment made by companies posing a national security risk. The Commerce Department was due to draw up an enforcement plan by mid-October but has yet to publish one.</p>
      <p>The Commerce Department is also considering whether to grant individual licenses for US firms to sell components to Huawei after receiving more than 200 requests.</p>
