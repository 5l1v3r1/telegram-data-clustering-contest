      <h1>St Mullins manager Niall O'Donnell says Michael Ryan inspired team to victory</h1>
      <h2>Selector Ryan suffered a heart attack during the course of their win over Cuala</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T06:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/authors/pat-nolan/" target="_blank">Pat Nolan</a></address>
      <p>Another tense one-point victory at Netwatch Cullen Park, but at least St Mullins could savour this one.</p>
      <p>Two weeks previously, there had been no euphoria attached to their dramatic win over Cuala as three ambulances made their way onto the pitch to tend to team selector, Micheal Ryan, who had suffered a heart attack during the course of the game.</p>
      <p>Thankfully, he’s now recovering well and watched yesterday’s win from his hospital bed in Dublin. He will undergo surgery this morning.</p>
      <p>“Hopefully if that goes well he will be discharged on Tuesday or Wednesday,” explained St Mullins manager Niall O’Donnell. “He was watching and was on to us by phone at half-time.”</p>
      <p>Naturally, their stricken selector’s predicament was referenced in the build-up to yesterday’s game as St Mullins reached a first Leinster final against Ballyhale Shamrocks, becoming just the second Carlow club to do so after Mount Leinster Rangers’ heroics in 2013.</p>
      <p>O’Donnell continued: "We spoke briefly about Micheal on Friday. He certainly wouldn't want to be the centre of any team talks but we did speak that he would love to have the opportunity to be here and in two weeks’ time.</p>
      <p>“I'm sure that was in the boys' heads, he's a great club man and they are certainly a great club team and they have great respect.”</p>
      <p>James Doyle emerged as the hero for St Mullins in the end when hitting the last two points, both of them superb individual efforts with the winner coming in the second minute of injury time after Rathdowney-Errill had edged back in front in the closing stages.</p>

      <p>For much of the game, it was a battle of the Kavanaghs, centre-forwards and free-takers on either side - Martin for St Mullins and Mark for Rathdowney.</p>
      <p>Mark had the better of the first half, during which Martin was somewhat wasteful despite scoring one goal and setting up another.</p>
      <p>Laois star Paddy Purcell hit the opening goal in the 10th minute after a trademark run through the centre but Rathdowney, despite being the better side, were pegged back by Kavanagh’s goal to lead by just 1-10 to 2-6 at half-time.</p>
      <p>Kavanagh’s influence grew in the second half for St Mullins, as did that of Doyle, who was shifted to midfield, from where he surged to strike the last two scores.</p>
      <p>“Everyone knows Marty Kavanagh now in the country. I’d rate Marty Kavanagh as one of the best hurlers I’ve ever seen,” said O’Donnell, before hailing Doyle’s contribution.</p>
      <p>“He [Doyle] came out the field and got five points and all quality scores. If we could have left him in the full-forward line, he could have got two or three goals today, no doubt about it.”</p>
      <p>Rathdowney-Errill manager John Delaney acknowledged that the club has had a “cracking year” but admitted that they had let a great opportunity slip.</p>
      <p>“Well, you don't like being gallant losers either,” he said. “Laois teams should expect a bit more than just to get here.</p>
      <p>“So of course we're not happy, I'm not happy with it, I think we could have had a good crack at the Leinster final if we got to it.</p>
      <p>“But you have to be there. You have to be there to progress and we're not and we'll have to accept that.”</p>
