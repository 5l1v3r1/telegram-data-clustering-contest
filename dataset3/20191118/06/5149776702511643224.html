      <h1>Historic wine shop owner hopes new addition to Lister Gate is a sign the area is on an upward curve</h1>
      <h2>Birds Bakery opened in the former H Samuel store, on the corner of Lister Gate and Castle Gate</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T06:00:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">Richard Tresidder</a></address>
      <p>For the last 60 years Alan Trease has watched the comings and goings of the city centre.</p>
      <p>In recent years, from the family wine merchants, <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/whats-on/food-drink/summery-new-gin-embodies-spirit-1631906">Weavers</a>, on Castle Gate, there have been more goings than comings as retailers and restaurants have shut up shop.</p>
      <p>What might have been a boom time for shopping - and selling wine and spirits - evaporated into the ether as shopping mall developers Westfield delayed and then pulled out of redeveloping the <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/broadmarsh-centre">Broadmarsh shopping centre</a>.</p>
      <p>Now owned by intu, itself battered by the retail gloom, it has only taken them eight years to make a start on its refurbishment, not with fashionable and glitzy shops, but bowling alleys and silver screens.</p>
      <p>But Alan, now 82 and still playing tennis, believes there are signs things are changing. Like the sighting of the biblical bird with a twig showing dry land is nearby, a traditional confectioner has opened next door.</p>
      <p>Derby-based Birds Bakery, the traditional bread shop, rebranded from Birds the Confectioners four years ago, recently opened its second Nottingham premises on the corner of Lister Gate and Castle Gate.</p>
      <p>“It must be a good spot,” says Alan. “When the Broadmarsh redevelopment is finished, footfall will return. This could be the first sign.”</p>
      <p>Misplaced optimism surrounding the revamped Broadmarsh Centre brought a range of outlets, Jamie Oliver, Carluccio’s, and Veeno’s among others who have since closed.</p>
      <p>Alan says he hopes shop units planned at the Drury Walk entrance to Broadmarsh will rekindle confidence and investment in Bridlesmith Gate, once a premier shopping street.</p>

      <p>Another sign of encouragement, if it comes off, is an idea to turn the former Castle Gate Congregation Chapel into a home for street food, a concept popular in London and Manchester. Small independents set up stalls serving foods from different cultures with the odd stall selling local beers and alcohol.</p>
      <p>“It is taking time but it would be a tremendous development for this area,” says Alan. Footfall should grow substantially when the redeveloped Nottingham Castle opens in February 2021.</p>
      <p>“With the Broadmarsh, the whole area will become a destination again,” he adds.</p>
      <p>Weavers, a well-established business on Nottingham’s high street now run by his children, Philip and Mary, has seen steady trade helped by its heritage.  </p>
      <p>Much is with bars and restaurants across the region. Geoffrey Trease, the erstwhile author, was a relation and published 113 books, many for children.</p>
      <p>Over the years, Alan has developed a range of house wines and spirits to mark the public mood, perhaps after a tough budget, to supplement Weavers own Castle Gate range.</p>
      <p>More recently, a fashionable trade in gin has developed with about 50 different brands. Eighty percent of sales are Weaver’s own gin from Nottingham, some shipped almost around the world because of its association with Robin Hood, says Alan.</p>
      <p>There is a subtle hint of acorns foraged from Sherwood Forest. Customers come from Birmingham and Thailand for it, he says. The strongest remains Plymouth Gin Navy strength at 57 per cent.</p>
      <p>Alan joined the family business in 1959 straight from National Service in the Royal Artillery, some time spent based in an underground radar station in Germany.</p>
      <p>“I was in charge of three men and played tennis all the time. The safety of Europe depended on us,” he says. And raises a glass.</p>
