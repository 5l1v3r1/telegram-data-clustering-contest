      <p>A Plymouth mum diagnosed with a brain tumour just weeks after giving birth visited a research centre where scientists are focused on finding a cure for the disease.</p>
      <p>Sylwia Florkowska, aged 37, was at the  <a href="https://www.braintumourresearch.org/">Brain Tumour Research</a>  Centre of Excellence at the University of Plymouth last Wednesday to tour the lab where scientists are researching the disease.</p>
      <p>The visit was inspired by Sylwia's own experience with a brain tumour. Sylwia, a pharmacy technician at Derriford Hospital, originally from Poland, began to suffer from vision problems and facial numbness just two days after giving birth in October 2018. Six weeks later, she was diagnosed with a large  <a href="https://www.braintumourresearch.org/info-support/types-of-brain-tumour/meningioma">meningioma</a>  – the most common form of adult primary brain tumour.</p>
      <p>Sylwia said: "Though my tumour is low-grade, it has a huge impact on my life. I have trouble hearing and despite having debulking surgery in May 2019, I constantly worry that I will need further treatment. It was a year of ups and downs being diagnosed so soon after giving birth but my son Jack has been a ray of sunshine through such a difficult time.</p>

      <p>"It hasn't been easy being a new mum and living with such a serious condition but I've had a fantastic support from my friends and family. My employer has also been really supportive and I can always talk to my manager."</p>
      <p>After the lab tour, Sylwia, joined by her fiancé Aaron Dadds and Aaron's sister Becky Matthews, and his mum Judith Dadds, from Plymouth, placed a commemorative tile on a Wall of Hope at the university. The tile represents the £2,740 it costs to fund a day of research and celebrates the fundraising achievements of Sylwia's family and friends.</p>
      <p>Earlier this year, a team of 14, including Aaron, his brother-in-law Ed Matthews and several of Becky’s colleagues at Total Repair Service, based in Plympton, <a href="https://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/news/plymouth-news/plymouth-mum-diagnosed-brain-tumour-2881884">took part in the Plymouth Half Marathon</a> . The running challenge, on May 19, raised more than £6,000 for Brain Tumour Research.</p>

      <p>Sylwia added: "It was fascinating to meet with Professor Oliver Hanemann and his team at the university, who are researching low-grade brain tumours like mine and it gave me a lot of hope going forward.</p>
      <p>"I was reminded how grateful I am for the treatment I had, under the care of my GP Dr Lemon, neurosurgeon Mr Palmer and nurse Tracy Mason. They, alongside my family, are the reason I am here today."</p>
      <p>Mel Tiley, community fundraising manager at Brain Tumour Research, said: "We are very grateful to Sylwia for sharing her story and helping to raise awareness of brain tumours – a disease which kills more children and adults under the age of 40 than any other cancer.</p>
      <p>"Historically less than 1 percent of the national spend on cancer research has been allocated to this devastating disease. We cannot allow this desperate situation to continue."</p>

      <p>Brain Tumour Research funds sustainable research at dedicated centres in the UK, including its centre at the University of Plymouth. It also campaigns for the Government and the larger cancer charities to invest more in research into brain tumours in order to speed up new treatments for patients and, ultimately, to find a cure.</p>
      <p>The charity is calling for an annual spend of £35m in order to improve survival rates and patient outcomes in line with other cancers such as breast cancer and leukaemia and is also campaigning for greater repurposing of drugs.</p>
