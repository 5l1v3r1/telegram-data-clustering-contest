      <h1>Medview bounces back after arrangement with NCAA</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T06:57:11+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 06:57</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://nairametrics.com/author/chidinma-nwagbara/" target="_blank">Chidinma Nwagbara</a></address>
      <p><b>Medview Airlines</b> has disclosed its rebranding strategy as it plans to purchase four new aircraft before the end of this year, according to <a href="https://thenationonlineng.net/medview-airlines-eyes-four-aircraft/">The Nation.</a></p>
      <p><b>The company made known</b> that the decision to restrategize and purchase more operational equipment is for the purpose of returning to scheduled flight operations in line with the agreement reached with the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA).</p>
      <p><b>The NCAA had made a move</b> to withdraw the Air Operating Certificate of Medview Airlines as a result of the lack of scheduled operations by the domestic airline. It was stated that NCAA frowned at the company’s shutdown of scheduled operation for a long period.</p>

      <p><b>Recall that Nairametrics</b> had <a href="https://nairametrics.com/2019/11/15/confusion-rocks-medview-as-ncaas-plan-to-withdraw-license-threaten-job/">reported</a> that NCAA planned to withdraw the license on November 10 but Medview was given more time to resume operations which is till the end of November.</p>
      <p><b>According to the Chief Operating Officer</b> (COO) and Accountable Manager, Michael Ajigbotosho, the airline was working hard to comply with NCAA requirements by having the minimum aircraft required to carry out scheduled operations so that it would resume this week.</p>
      <p>
        <i>”We are resuming operations very soon on the Lagos – Abuja route and other routes subject to passenger availability. The aircraft is already on ground and we have commenced technical flights in line with statutory requirements. We have fully mobilised our technical crew, pilots and other support personnel ahead of resumption of flights.</i>

      <p>
        <i>“Our second aircraft, Boeing 737-400 marked with registration number 5N MAB will be out of Aero Contractors Maintenance Repair and Overhaul (MRO) facility in three weeks. This will help us meet the statutory requirement of scheduled operators having at least minimum of two aircraft to carry out scheduled domestic flights..</i>
      </p>
      <p><i>“The third airplane is being prepared for readiness of operations by mid-December,”</i> he said.</p>
      <p><b>Why Medview had to shutdown:</b> Ajigbotosho explained that the airline had to shut down on August 10<sup>th</sup> this year because it needed to carry out major maintenance on its aircraft. Speaking further, he said that efforts had been put in place by the management of Medview to ensure that it does not overshoot NCAA’s November 30 deadline.</p>
