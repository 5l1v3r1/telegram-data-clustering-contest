      <p>In a segment, she agreed that love was simpler in the 1990s.</p>
      <p>“We didn’t have phones. Mobiles came in the late 1990s or I would say early 1990s, around 1996 if I am not mistaken and trust me it was very unaffordable. It was really expensive,” she said.</p>
      <p>Asked if love in the 1990 era was simple, Shilpa said: “Yeah, the way we dialled the person and leave blank calls.</p>
      <p>“I just feel it was simpler. I don’t know, I can’t even describe it. Life is just so complicated today, we just complicate it for ourselves. And also there’s so much pressure today, on relationships. But I think you just have to go with the flow.”</p>
      <p>Shilpa feels there is no “playing hard to get”.</p>
      <p>On the work front, Shilpa will soon be making a comeback with Sabbir Khan’s action film “Nikamma”.</p>
