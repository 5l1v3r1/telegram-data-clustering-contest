      <p><a href="https://tech.slashdot.org/~140Mandak262Jamuna">140Mandak262Jamuna</a> writes: <i>Battery electric vehicle (BEV) fans are all excited about <a href="https://electrek.co/2019/11/17/great-artists-steal-why-fords-mustang-mach-e-was-inspired-by-tesla-in-all-the-right-ways/">the introduction of an all-electric SUV by Ford</a>. Specs and pricing are very similar to Tesla. Interior also is very similar with a large touchscreen. Elon Musk congratulated Ford <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1196295253268946945?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1196295253268946945&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2019%2F11%2F18%2Fcars%2Fford-mustang-elon-musk-tesla-trnd%2Findex.html">on Twitter</a> and Ford returned the compliments. Die-hard Tesla fans are saying Tesla is still better. Other BEV fans are welcoming Ford. I, for one, welcome the more affordable all-electric, non-compliance BEV (Ford's words, not mine).</i> Ford's Mustang Mach-E is expected to achieve between 210 miles and at least 300 miles of range on a full charge, depending on the model. Top performance models will achieve 0 to 60 mph in the mid-three-second range with an estimated 459 horsepower and 612 lb.-ft. of torque. <br/><br/>Unlike Tesla's Model 3 or upcoming Model Y, the Mach-E qualifies for federal tax incentives of up to $7,500. It will range from $43,895 for the base "Select" model to roughly $60,500 for the GT model.</p>
