        <b>A £10 million funding package has been agreed to underpin growth in Scotland’s aquaculture sector – including salmon farms and mussel producers - to help it deliver a £3.6 billion boost to Scotland’s economy by 2030.</b>
      </p>
      <p>The Scottish Aquaculture Innovation Centre (SAIC) has secured the five-year deal, which will be used to overcome industry challenges and improve skills, from the Scottish Funding Council, Scottish Enterprise, and Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE).</p>
      <p>A further £3.5m is expected to be secured from other sources.</p>
      <p>During its first five-year phase, SAIC turned an initial funding package of £6.75m, into a portfolio valued at £42.6m across 47 initiatives. Of the total figure invested, £33.8m came from industry and other partners – leading to the creation of more than 200 jobs, largely in rural areas.</p>
      <p>The SAIC also supported the development of the aquaculture talent pool by funding the studies of 92 Master’s and PhD students.</p>
      <p>The centre has played a key role in the development of the industry’s plan to sustainably double the sector’s economic contribution to the Scottish economy from £1.8bn in 2016 to £3.6bn by 2030.</p>
      <p>
        <b>'Making a real difference'</b>
      </p>
      <p>David Gregory, chairman of the SAIC, said the centre has helped the industry deal with some of its biggest challenges – which individual businesses wouldn’t have been able to tackle on their own – through access to academic expertise and applied research.</p>
      <p>He said: “The level of investment from industry is testament to that success: our original goal was to attract £1 of industry investment for every £1 we spent on projects, but we have delivered significantly more than that. The projects have been industry-relevant, attracting hard cash from partners and delivering outcomes that could make a real difference.</p>
      <p>“We have also encouraged the industry to talk about the good work that is being done and re-invent the way it shares information, not only with itself, but the wider world too.”</p>

      <p>In its strategy for the next five years, the SAIC plans to drive innovation by leveraging new sources of funding and bringing multiple partners together from across the UK, with a particular focus on engaging with small businesses.</p>
      <p>It also plans to work with undergraduates and schools to build awareness of aquaculture as a career and back a mentoring scheme helping the growth of the Women in Scottish Aquaculture network.</p>
