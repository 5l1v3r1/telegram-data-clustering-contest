      <p><a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/michelle-visage">Michelle Visage</a> is said to have stormed out of Blackpool minutes after the curtain came down on her <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a> journey.</p>
      <p>The American upped and left as soon as she knew her Glitterball dream had died, report <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/10365062/strictly-michelle-visage-pushed-out-competition/">The Sun</a> .</p>
      <p>They claim she is angry at not being included in the lucrative end-of-series tour - and that the Drag Race star believes she has been 'pushed out'.</p>
      <p>The story comes after an online spat with former Strictly dancer James Jordan.</p>
      <p>The source said: “Michelle felt like getting voted out was the final insult after getting the sense she wasn’t welcomed as much as the other stars.</p>

      <p>“She wasn't included on the line-up for next year's <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/strictly-come-dancing">Strictly Come Dancing</a> tour. That was a snub she took personally.</p>
      <p>“She had also been having difficulties with Giovanni. She feels let down that mainstream viewers didn’t get it (her dance to Madonna’s Vogue). She had hoped to go all the way to the final.”</p>
      <p>Mirror Online have approached her team for comment.</p>
      <p>Michelle, 51, and dance partner Giovanni Pernice, 29, had been in the bottom two against Saffron Barker, 19, and AJ Pritchard, 25.</p>

      <p>She has not gone quietly - and got into a twitter row with outspoken James after leaving Blackpool behind.</p>
      <p>James alleges she only performed to iconic Madonna hit Vogue to win 'the LGBT vote'.</p>
      <p>He then called out her 'fake tears' before she responsed.</p>

      <p>She tweeted: "That's deplorable. Gross" after being directed to his post - before telling him: "Also James, you should @ people when you talk about them! That's all."</p>
      <p>He then claimed she was trolling him.</p>
      <p>James said her choice backfired, adding: "Not for me sorry... not dancing, just posing. Obviously needs the LGBTQIA community's vote".</p>

      <p>She later responded: "The only way to change the world is by taking risks. I'm SOOOOOO proud of this dance and going out on this one."</p>
      <p>James hit back, saying: "I love the fact I’m being trolled by <a href="https://twitter.com/michellevisage">@michellevisage</a> for my honest opinions on <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/twitter">Twitter</a> and never once “@“ her in any tweet Didn’t realise I wasn’t allowed my own opinion on my own account.</p>
