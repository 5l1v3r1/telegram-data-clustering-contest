      <h3>Barca’s sporting director, Eric Abidal, confirms that Barcelona are ​talking with Lionel Messi over a new contract that will see the Argentine finish his career at the Camp Nou.</h3>
      <p>Messi has a clause in his current contract that allows him to leave Blaugrana for free next summer.</p>
      <p>The Argentine is currently in his 16th season with Blaugrana, have joined the Spanish Champions in 2001, making his competitive debut in 2004.</p>
      <p>The five-time Ballon d’Or winner has recently mentioned his desires to remain in Catalonia and thus discussion of a “Lifetime contract” has begun to ensure that the G.O.A.T sees out his playing days at FC Barcelona.</p>
      <p>Barcelona’s sporting director, Eric Abidal, has confirmed that the club has made Messi’s contract renewal their top priority.</p>
      <blockquote>“For us, he [Lionel Messi] is a key player,” Abidal told<a href="https://www.sport-english.com/en/news/barca/abidal-reveals-contact-been-made-to-renew-lionel-messis-barca-contract-7737949"><b> ​Sport</b></a>. “He has an option to leave in his contract, but I know that the president [Bartomeu] is speaking with his representatives to close the case once and for all.”</blockquote>
      <p>Messi previously renewed his contract in 2017 but had added a clause allowing him to leave in 2021 due to his desire to return to Argentina. But the 32-year-old forward has hinted his new intentions of remaining at Barca, and possibly even retire at the club.</p>
      <blockquote>Abidal added: “I hope he stays here for many more years and I believe that he will. It will be Leo’s decision. And, as he says, Barça before anything else. He’s the best.”</blockquote>
      <p>​Messi suffered from an injury at the beginning of the season but managed to return in an outstanding fashion, having scored eight goals and providing four assists in seven league appearances. His ability to influence a match is impeccable and will continue to help Barca in their current domestic competitions along with their Champions League goals, where the club currently sits at the top of their group.</p>
      <p>Messi, who won the Best FIFA Player of the Year award in September, made his return for Argentina following a three-month ban on Friday. The Argentine scored the winner to beat international rivals, Brazil, 1-0 in a friendly at the King Saud University Stadium in Riyadh.</p>
      <p>Where do you think Messi will play next season?</p>
