      <p>Sharon Evans appeared live on air alongside comedian John Bishop, American actress Idina Menzel and electronic music band Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark for the show on Friday morning.</p>
      <p>She and her friend Rachael Dean were treated to the full VIP treatment, taken on a tour of the Wogan House studios in London and then watched the filming of the Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two television programme.</p>
      <p>Sharon won the competition after correctly answering five showbusiness-related questions in 60 seconds in the show's 5-Star Biz Quiz slot on Thursday.</p>
      <p>Sharon said: "It's been absolutely brilliant, it's been the most amazing experience. I always listen to the show.</p>
      <p>"I was invited to ask Idina a question, which was 'how different is it voicing a film character to acting on the stage?'</p>
      <p>"She answered that she enjoyed them both, but they were very different."</p>
      <p>Sharon said the experience had really whetted appetite about how the media worked, and said she would love work in radio.</p>
      <p>"It's such a buzzing, cool place to work," she said.</p>
