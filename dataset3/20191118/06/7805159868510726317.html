      <p>Samsung’s flagship S and Note lineup are offered in two different processor variants around the world. While devices in the US, China, Latin America, etc. receive the Qualcomm Snapdragon chipset, most other regions receive devices with an Exynos chip. Due to this, custom ROM development for the devices is a bit inconsistent, to say the least. At a time when most devices are getting their <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-10-custom-roms-available-oneplus-3-3t-xiaomi-mi-pad-4-mi-6x-huawei-p-smart-2018-samsung-galaxy-a70-sony-xperia-xa2-ultra/">first taste of Android 10</a> with official or unofficial builds of <a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/tag/lineageos/">LineageOS</a> 17, the Galaxy Note 10 series powered by the Exynos chipset is getting its first unofficial build of LineageOS 16 based on Android 9 Pie.</p>

      <p>In case you have a Galaxy Note 10, Note 10+ or Note 10+ 5G, you’d be glad to know that you can now flash LineageOS 16 on your device. You can download the ROM from the link below and follow the instructions in the post to flash it on your device. But before you do that, there are some things you should know about the current build. As of now, the unofficial LineageOS 16 build for the Galaxy Note 10 series has a couple of major issues. The build doesn’t include support for VoLTE or VoWiFi, it doesn’t feature complete compatibility with the new S Pen functionality, and 5G connectivity on the build is spotty at best.</p>
      <p>Other than the aforementioned issues, this unofficial LineageOS 16 build is reportedly quite stable and can be used on your daily driver. Unlike other LineageOS builds, this one also includes support for the in-display fingerprint scanner. However, the developer hasn’t added the fingerprint icon yet, so you might have some trouble locating the fingerprint sensor on your device. If you wish to use Google apps on this build, you’ll need to flash it separately, right after you flash the ROM and before the first boot.</p>
