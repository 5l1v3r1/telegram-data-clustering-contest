      <p>The film, not titled yet, is being directed by debutant Kaashvie Nair and produced by Bhushan Kumar, Nikkhil Advani, and John Abraham.</p>
      <p>Talking about the project, Rakul had said: “The film is in the rom-com space, and it is the story of characters who belong to India and Pakistan, so it’s a cross-border, coming-of-age rom-com.”</p>
      <p>Talking about Arjun, apart from the Kaashvie Nair’s yet to be titled rom-com, the actor also has a big project lined up for release in form of filmmaker Ashutosh Gowariker’s period drama <i>Panipat</i> which also stars Sanjay Dutt and Kriti Sanon in lead.</p>
      <p>The historical war film will release on 6th December 2019.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Rakul’s latest release <i>Marjaavaan</i> which has Sidharth Malhotra, Riteish Deshmukh and Tara Sutaria has been gaining a wonderful response from the cine-goers.</p>
