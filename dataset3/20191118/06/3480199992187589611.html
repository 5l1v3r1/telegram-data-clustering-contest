      <p>Officers had been called to the home of Daniel Bourne's girlfriend in Sundorne on October 13 this year due to a domestic incident.</p>
      <p>Bourne left the property but panicked when he saw police cars and, when he remember he had the machete, decided to speed away from them.</p>
      <p>Dashcam footage from a police vehicle giving chase showed Bourne's car accelerating along Sundorne Road, taking corners quickly and going fast along Albert Road, Moston Road and throughout Sundorne estate - an area which has a lot of parked cars and in many parts only has room for one lane of traffic.</p>
      <p>Bourne whizzed past pedestrians and at one point was inches away from a cyclist.</p>
      <p>At another stage the footage shows Bourne's car on the grass with a big dent in the driver's door, where a police car attempted a controlled stop, before Bourne speeds off down the road again.</p>
      <p>He eventually made off down Whitchurch Road.</p>
      <h3>Previous</h3>
      <p>Prosecutor Wendy Miller told Shrewsbury Crown Court: "The footage shows him moving off at excessive speed and making numerous dangerous manoeuvres."</p>
      <p>Bourne, of Hawksley, Shrewsbury, handed himself in at a police station a few days later.</p>
      <p>In court he pleaded guilty to dangerous driving and possession of a bladed article. He already had a previous conviction for possession of a knuckleduster in 2016.</p>
      <p>Stephen Scully, defending Bourne, said: "It was in a built up area. It is not clear what speed he was going at but he accepts his driving was dangerous. He is somebody who has had difficulties in his upbringing."</p>
      <p>Judge Peter Barrie told Bourne: "There is no good reason for having an item like a machete in your car, There was no good reason for having a knuckleduster in 2016.</p>
      <p>"Your driving was clearly dangerous and an attempt to escape from the police which put the public in danger."</p>
      <p>He jailed Bourne for 30 weeks and disqualified him from driving for 12 months.</p>
