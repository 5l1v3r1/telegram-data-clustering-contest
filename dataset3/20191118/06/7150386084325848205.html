      <p><b>New Delhi: </b>Police on Monday stopped the protesting students of Jawaharlal Nehru University at Ber Sarai road of Delhi and disallowed their march towards the Parliament. The Centre also imposed Section 144 near the Parliament in Delhi ahead of the protest march called for by the Students’ Union of <a href="https://www.india.com/news/india/jnu-administration-condemns-warns-to-take-stringent-action-over-defacement-of-vivekananda-statue-3846574/">Jawaharlal Nehru University</a>, stated news agency ANI on Monday.</p>
      <p>Hundred of troops were deployed outside the JNU campus to prevent any incidents of violence by the JNU students, stated a report. The students’ union marched to the Parliament on November 18 which happens to be the beginning of the winter session.</p>
      <p>Taking stock of the tense situation on Monday, Education Secretary from the Ministry of Human Resource Department R Subrahmanyam was quoted by news agency <i>ANI</i> as saying, “MHRD has appointed a high power committee for discussion with students and administration for peaceful resolution of all issues.”</p>

      <p>Security was beefed up on Monday, as suggested by the pictures tweeted by news agency ANI which showed police officers standing outside Jawaharlal Nehru University. The purpose of JNU Students’ Union march to Parliament is to demand a complete rollback of the fee hike, stated a report. “It’s a way to appeal to lawmakers to fight on their behalf inside the floor of the house,” added the Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union (JNUSU), as quoted as saying by news agency <i>IANS</i>.</p>

      <p>In yet another incident on Sunday, the JNU administration condemned the acts of vandalism committed by the varsity students, including the recent defacement of Swami Vivekananda statue in the campus. A police complaint was filed by JNU professor and chairman of the Swami Vivekananda Statue Installation Committee, Buddha Singh, over the ‘defacement’ of the yet-to-be-unveiled Vivekananda statue.</p>
      <p>“Condemn the vandalism done by students. Everything has been recorded. Chief Proctor Office will take stringent action possible against those who will be found guilty,” a JNU administration staff was quoted by news agency <i>ANI</i> as saying on November 17.</p>
