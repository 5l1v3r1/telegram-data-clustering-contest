      <p>A mum who lost her daughter and father-in-law in a car crash has relived the day out that ended in tragedy as figures revealed 18 people are killed or seriously injured on <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/">North East</a> roads every week.</p>
      <p>Becky Frankel's eldest child Tiggy was killed when a car driven by her grandad, Richard Frankel, went into the back of a stationary lorry that was parked in a layby on the <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/a1">A1</a> near <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/newcastle-upon-tyne">Newcastle</a> in August 2008.</p>
      <p>The family had enjoyed a day out in <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/alnwick">Alnwick</a> and Becky was driving back with her mother-in-law and two youngest daughters, while Richard, seven-year-old Tiggy, and the two dogs, travelled in convoy behind.</p>
      <p>Becky, 45, from Wylam, <a href="https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/all-about/northumberland">Northumberland</a> , said: "On the way up the three girls and my mother-in-law had come with me, but on the way back Tiggy said it was a long journey for Richard to go by himself.</p>
      <p>"We were going to drive to Kingston Park to get some stuff from M&amp;S."</p>
      <p>But when Becky came off the A1 onto the slip road, she realised that Richard's car wasn't behind her anymore.</p>
      <p>"I tried to go back to look for them but there was lots of traffic on the opposite side of the road, then I saw two fire engines going the way we had come.</p>
      <p>"My mother-in-law was trying to ring Richard but couldn't get through.</p>
      <p>"We decided to go home to see if they were already there, but they weren't.</p>
      <p>"I put on the radio and at that point they said there had been a crash at Kingston Park on the A1 southbound.</p>

      <p>"I had been feeling incredibly anxious from the moment they weren't behind us, but I felt even more anxious then.</p>
      <p>"I rang the fire service and gave them a description of the car, and they said they would let us know.</p>
      <p>"Then I went to play the piano - a piece that Tiggy liked me to play because she danced to it. That was to feel close to her because I knew I couldn't go back to look for her.</p>
      <p>"Two police officers arrived, I ran outside to meet them on the pavement, and that's when they told us."</p>
      <p>The family later found out that Richard had entered a layby without braking and gone into the back of a lorry at 68mph. The crash killed Richard, Tiggy, and one of the dogs.</p>

      <p>The circumstances of the collision remain a mystery, but Becky said: "One thing we do know is that he would never have wanted to have a crash.</p>
      <p>"The most likely explanation is he mistook the layby for a slip road. The layby has been shut since, and there are quite a few laybys that are not really safe, either because they're too close to a slip road or because they're too narrow."</p>
      <p>In the aftermath of the crash Becky became involved with road safety charity Brake and has become a prolific fundraiser for Brake, taking part in sponsored long-distance runs, swims and cycles, including swimming the length of the English Channel in a day.</p>
      <p>As a result of her hard fundraising, campaigning and voluntary work, Becky was awarded an MBE by the Queen in 2016.</p>
      <p>She is telling her story as part of national Road Safety Week as figures reveal 52 people were killed and 872 seriously injured on the region’s roads in 2018. The region also saw a 17% increase in the number of pedestrians being killed or seriously injured in 2018, with 260 pedestrians killed or seriously injured compared to 222 in 2017.</p>
      <p>Gateshead has seen the biggest rise in the total number of people killed or seriously injured with an increase of 25%, rising from 53 in 2017 to 66 in 2018.</p>
      <p>Brake is sharing inspiring stories of supporters in the region who are campaigning to reduce road danger.</p>
      <p>Becky said: "I don;t believe anyone wants to crash but it can happen and it is preventable. By making safer decisions when driving hopefullt less crashes will happen. When I drive I'm always aware of the damage it can do and the devastation it can cause.</p>
      <p>"It's changed the way we live our lives."</p>
      <p>One way to get involved with Road Safety Week is by completing Brake’s survey about the safety of the streets where you live. The findings will be shared with local authorities to help them understand the views of the people who live, work and play on their streets.
