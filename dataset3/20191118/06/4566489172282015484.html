      <h1>Cambodian opposition leader still to face treason trial: PM</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T06:00:20+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 06:00</time> by <a rel="author">AFP</a></address>
      <p>Cambodian opposition figure Kem Sokha, freshly freed from house arrest, will still stand trial for treason, strongman premier Hun Sen said Monday.</p>
      <p>Kem Sokha, 66, is the co-founder of the banned Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), which was dissolved ahead of widely criticised elections last year.</p>
      <p>Arrested in 2017 and accused of plotting to overthrow Hun Sen's government, he was detained first in a remote prison and then under house arrest before his bail conditions were relaxed last week.</p>
      <p>The court closed the investigation into his case on Friday but Hun Sen, who has ruled Cambodia since 1985, clarified Monday he would still face trial.</p>
      <p>"The charges (against Kem Sokha) will not be dropped," Hun Sen said amid swirling rumours the King would soon pardon him.</p>
      <p>"They simply closed the investigation so the case can be sent to trial," he said, without confirming when it would start.</p>
      <p>The case would take "a long time" to finish, he added, also offering a veiled threat to other opposition members not to "run into walls".</p>
      <p>Kem Sokha is currently banned from leaving Cambodia or taking part in political activities.</p>
      <p>After meetings with a number of foreign envoys to Cambodia, he posted Friday a message on Facebook calling for "national reconciliation".</p>
      <p>Rights groups say Cambodia's legal system is completely controlled by Hun Sen's government.</p>
      <p>Sokha's political partner Sam Rainsy, meanwhile, returned to France over the weekend after attempting a highly publicised comeback for Cambodia's November 9 independence day.</p>
      <p>Rainsy has lived in France since 2015 to avoid jail for convictions he says are politically motivated.</p>
      <p>He promised a dramatic return to Cambodia but ended up waylaid in Malaysia and Indonesia with other CNRP officials.</p>
      <p>Hun Sen last week ordered the release on bail of more than 70 opposition members and activists that authorities accused of helping Rainsy return.</p>
      <p>The dissolution of the CNRP in 2017 paved the way for Hun Sen's ruling party to sweep a widely criticised election last year, turning Cambodia into a one-party state.</p>
      <p>As a result, the European Union started a review of a duty-free tariff scheme for the country's lucrative garment sector.</p>
      <p>Analysts say the possible removal of the deal is a rare political weak spot for Hun Sen.</p>
