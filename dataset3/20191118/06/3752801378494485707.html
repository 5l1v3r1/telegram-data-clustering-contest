      <p>A man was flung from his bakkie and landed up in a tree when he lost control of the vehicle on the M7 Durban-bound near the Winston Churchill off-ramp on Sunday at around 14:30.</p>
      <p>According to Rescue Care spokesperson Garrith Jamieson, paramedics arrived on the scene "to find chaos".</p>

        </a>
      </p>
      <p>A bakkie had somehow lost control before rolling down a side embankment.</p>
      <p>"As the bakkie was rolling, the three occupants were all ejected from the vehicle," Jamieson said. </p>
      <p>"The driver was found stuck up a tree with moderate injuries."</p>
      <p>The Durban Fire Department, assisted by the community and Rescue Care Paramedics, had to use a ladder to get to the patient before bringing him down to safety.</p>
      <p>"One passenger had sustained critical injuries and was found lying in the slow lane. Advanced life support paramedics placed the man on a manual ventilator on the scene. The three occupants, once stabilised, were transported to the Lenmed Ethekwini Hospital and Heart Centre for the urgent care that they required."</p>
      <p>The events leading up to the collision is unknown; however, the SAPS were on the scene and will be investigating further.</p>
