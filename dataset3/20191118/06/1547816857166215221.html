        <b>Recently, Malaika Arora was spotted in the city where she was seen taking an auto ride instead of rolling into her luxurious sedan</b>
      </p>
      <p>Though she doesn’t mark an impactful presence on the big screens, Malaika Arora surely makes an impact off-screen. Her Instagram handle is food for us, from her workout sessions, her sartorial fashion choices to getting clicked with her beau Arjun Kapoor and her vacation diaries, Malla’s feed is a delight to watch. She never fails to surprise us and that’s what we love about Malaika. Talking on the same topic, recently, Arora was spotted in the city but she did something very interesting and we can’t help but write about that.</p>
      <p>While heading home, she was seen getting into a rickshaw with her mom Joyce Polycarp instead of rolling into her luxurious car. Well, it is pretty interesting to see Bollywood celebs taking an auto ride rather than going in their swanky ride. We have earlier seen Kiara Advani, Hrithik Roshan with his kids Hreddan and Hrihaan and Salman Khan opting for a rickshaw. Not just Bollywood celebs, even the royal couple Kate Middleton and Prince William took rickshaw during their Pakistan Royal visit. Guess, riding in a rickshaw has kind of become a trend.</p>

      <p>Talking about Malla’s look, the actress was seen wearing a white shirt type dress with a cool hat. She paired her easy-breezy dress with a pair of brown swagger boots that don’t look that impressive at all. It seems way too much for this outing. If we minus her boots, she looked good. <b>ALSO READ: <a href="https://www.spotboye.com/fashion/fashion-news/mira-rajput-malaika-arora-and-amyra-dastur-who-said-you-can-t-look-sexy-while-sweating-it-out/5dcbbc7287fb571eff7e3ca4">Mira Rajput, Malaika Arora And Amyra Dastur- Who Said You Can’t Look Sexy While Sweating It Out?</a></b></p>
