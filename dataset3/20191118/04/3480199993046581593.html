      <p>Sebastian Vettel and Charles Leclerc have been summoned by Ferrari to the Italian team’s Maranello headquarters following their collision in Sunday’s Brazilian Grand Prix.</p>
      <p>The warring Ferrari drivers crashed out with five laps remaining as they diced for fourth position.</p>
      <p>Team principal Mattia Binotto refused to apportion blame and also ruled out fining either driver.</p>
      <p>But both men, withdrawn by Ferrari from a scheduled media briefing in Interlagos on Sunday evening, will be reminded of their responsibilities to the team at a crisis summit this week.</p>

      <p>“When doing things in the heat of the moment, you can come to the wrong conclusion,” said Binotto.</p>
      <p>“I have heard from both drivers, but I will meet with them to discuss what happened. There will be time for the team to analyse the video and data.</p>
      <p>“It is not a matter of fining or blaming. We let them race, but being free to fight doesn’t mean they should make silly mistakes. In truth, this sort of thing should never happen.”</p>
      <p>Red Bull’s Max Verstappen won a chaotic race from pole position, his third victory of the season, with Toro Rosso’s Pierre Gasly a surprise second, and Carlos Sainz third for McLaren.</p>
      <p>Sainz, who ended McLaren’s five-season podium drought, was promoted one place after world champion Lewis Hamilton had been dealt a five-second post-race penalty following the Briton’s late collision with Alex Albon.</p>

      <p>The coming together cost rookie, Albon, 23, his first career podium, and Hamilton was swift to accept his responsibility for the accident.</p>
      <p>“I apologise to Alex, and I hold my hands up for what happened,” said Hamilton, who was demoted to seventh and hit with two penalty points on his drivers’ licence.</p>
      <p>“I totally accept the blame. It was not my intention and you hardly ever see me collide with anyone. In hindsight I could have waited to make the move, but hindsight is a wonderful thing.</p>
      <p>“An opportunity arose and I was in shooting distance of Alex. I gave it a shot because in my mind I was trying to catch Max [Verstappen] for the win.</p>
      <p>“That won’t be the last time Alex is in position for a podium. He will have many more great races so, as hard a pill as it is for him to swallow, I hope he can learn from the experience.”</p>
