      <p>A Moree visitor has vowed to never return after she claims she was mugged by a group of children on Friday night.</p>
      <p>Namka Fabrizio had been in Moree trying to sell her property when she was harassed while walking past Kirkby Park at about 11.45pm on Friday, November 15.</p>
      <p>"I missed the last bus, so I was walking to go over the bridge to a girlfriend's place, which is where I'm staying," she said.</p>
      <p>Ms Fabrizio, who is from Sydney, said she was approached by a group of 18 children, ranging in ages from eight to 12.</p>

      <p>"They circled me so I couldn't go anywhere and then they started throwing things," she said.</p>
      <p>"While I was dealing with one of the children, another snatched at my bag. They turned my bag upside and emptied it.</p>
      <p>"They all scavenged [the contents of my bag].</p>
      <p>"They tried to snatch my phone out of my hand."</p>
      <p>During the incident, Ms Fabrizio claims she had money, medication, cigarettes and clothes and shoes she'd bought that day from St Vincent de Paul stolen from her bag.</p>
      <p>She told <i>The Moree Champion</i> that she received cuts and bruises during the attack and ended up in hospital later that night.</p>
      <p>"Frightening? It affected my health so badly that I ended up in hospital," she said.</p>
      <p>Ms Fabrizio called triple zero during the incident, but said she was disappointed by the police's response.</p>
      <p>She believes there should be a curfew for children.</p>
      <p>"It just disgusts me," she said.</p>
      <p>"Do I need to have a man or security to walk through Moree? It's sick.</p>
      <p>"I've never seen an eight-year-old out of bed at that time of night.</p>
      <p>"There has to be a curfew for children. If the parents aren't doing their job, charge the parents."</p>
      <p>This was Ms Fabrizio's tenth visit to Moree, and her last, after the attack.</p>
      <p>"This is my third trip in two months - I'm trying to deal with a deceased's estate," she said.</p>
      <p>"I have a house which I was going to do up to live in, but that's not going to happen now. I don't want it.</p>
      <p>"I'm out of here tomorrow [Tuesday] morning."</p>
      <p>Police confirmed that they attended the scene around midnight and did all they could to help Ms Fabrizio.</p>
      <p>"We are making inquiries into identifying the group of youths that were located at the scene," acting Inspector Cameron Paine said.</p>
      <p>"We are still dealing with some ongoing issues related to youth delinquency."</p>
      <p>Acting Inspector Paine reminded residents to vigilant around their safety, particularly at night.</p>
