      <h1>Focus on Aluminium Extrusion Industries Plc and its declining 2019 performance</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T04:55:43+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 04:55</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://nairametrics.com/author/emmanuel-abara/" target="_blank">Emmanuel Abara Benson</a></address>
      <p>For <b>Aluminium Extrusion Industries Plc</b>, which happens to be the only aluminium manufacturer currently listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange, 2019 has not been such a good year. Although the company has not exactly recorded a loss thus far, its profits declined drastically, according to latest earnings report seen by Nairametrics. Based on this underperformance, it is not surprising that a lot of investors chose to ignore the stock.</p>
      <p>On this week’s Nairametrics Company Profile, we take a closer look at Aluminium Extrusion Industries Plc. As always, we shall be focusing on the company’s business model, its target audience, and prospects. We shall also be examining some of the possible challenges (such as competition) which might be impacting negatively on the company’s growth.</p>
