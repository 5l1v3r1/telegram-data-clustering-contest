      <p>© DOCTORS Without Borders (MSF) has complained that the drought and the prevailing economic situation is worsening the plight of diabetic patients as they can only afford less than two meals per day, putting them at risk of developing hypoglycaemia.</p>
      <p>Hypoglycaemia is when blood sugar decreases to below normal levels resulting in a variety of symp- toms including clumsiness, trouble talking, confusion, loss of conscious- ness, seizures and even death.</p>
      <p>MSF counsellor for health promotion in the Manicaland’s Non-Communicable Disease (NCD) project Kudakwashe Golden said<br/>in the management of people living with diabetes, it’s important to stick to strict dietary measures which are usually dependant on the environment in which they are surviving.</p>
      <p>“As Doctors Without Borders, we are operating in rural contexts where most patients that we manage usually live on one or two meals per day which is not encouraged for diabetic patients. They have to eat more than four times a day meaning that in between meals they have to have a snack.</p>
      <p>“The moment they skip meals, their blood sugar gets low and when it gets low it goes to an acute com- plication that we call hypoglycaemia where sugar levels become very low and body parts will not function properly,” Golden said.</p>
      <p>This comes as the world commemorated World Diabetes Day on Thursday under the theme “The Family and Diabetes”.</p>
      <p>During diabetes day celebrations hosted by the Diabetics Association of Zimbabwe (Daz) and Blue Circle Voices(BCV) Network, Heather Koga encouraged families to help diabetic patients manage their diet by offering them economic support and encouraging them to exercise.</p>
      <p>“Research has shown that patients have better health when their families are supportive and share in the same disease management. Many describe diabetes as having helped them to become closer to their families.</p>
      <p>“Talking about foods, cooking together, exercising together, going to doctors’ visits together and so forth, help families grow together,” Koga said.</p>
