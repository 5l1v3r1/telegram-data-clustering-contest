      <h1>Frost atop Doi Inthanon heralds the arrival of chilly time in Thailand (Photos)</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T04:00:18+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 04:00</time> by <a rel="author" href="https://coconuts.co/profile/Coconuts%20Bangkok" target="_blank">Coconuts Bangkok</a></address>
      <p>It’s beginning to look a bit like Christmas atop Thailand’s highest peak located in northern Chiang Mai province. </p>
      <p>Pictures from Doi Inthanon National Park this morning show grass and plants covered with white frost, an annual signifier that temperatures will fall across the kingdom in the next few weeks.</p>
      <p>“This morning the temperature at Doi Inthanon peak dropped to 4C, creating frost [and] causing much excitement for visitors that traveled to the peak for a taste of winter,” the national park system announced today.</p>
      <p>The temperature at Doi Inthanon is warmer than the -1C it was when the <a href="https://coconuts.co/bangkok/news/thailands-highest-peak-gets-frosty-temperatur">frost hit last year</a>, 11 days later in November. That means less frost is covering its plants and trees.</p>

      </p>
      <p>The Meteorological Department predicts that the temperature will fall another 1C to 4C with isolated light rain in the upper part of the country for the next week. A northeast monsoon traveling across the gulf will cause heavy rain in the South. High waves and strong winds can be expected this week.</p>
      <p>In Bangkok, the weather is expected to remain partly cloudy with a light morning fog. Temperatures are expected to range from lows of 24C highs of 36C in the coming week.</p>
