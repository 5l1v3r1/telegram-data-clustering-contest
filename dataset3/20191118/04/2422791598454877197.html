      <p>HONG KONG -- For days, Hong Kong's protesters fortified a university campus to keep police from getting in. Now, cornered by authorities, they are trying to get out.</p>
      <p>Officers repelled one attempt Monday morning with tear gas, driving a few hundred protesters back into the Hong Kong Polytechnic campus.</p>
      <p>The protesters want to avoid arrest. The police have set up a dragnet around the campus to pick up as many as they can.</p>
      <p>It's a game that has played out repeatedly during the city's months of anti-government unrest. Protesters cause disruption, then try to melt away before police run in to grab as many as they can.</p>
      <p>Other protesters blocked a major road near Polytechnic as the work week started in a bid to help those inside the campus escape by distracting police.</p>
