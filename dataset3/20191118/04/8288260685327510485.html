      <h3>Man Utd's Pereira 'interest'</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/west-bromwich-albion-fc">West Bromwich Albion</a> could face Premier League competition if they look to make <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/matheus-pereira">Matheus Pereira's</a> loan deal permanent.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old has been in impressive form since joining the Baggies on a season-long loan from Sporting Lisbon in the summer.</p>
      <p>He has scored three goals and registered a staggering nine assists so far to help his side to the Championship summit.</p>
      <p>And according to the Mirror, those performances have impressed talent spotters at Manchester United, who have been keeping tabs on Pereira's progress.</p>
      <p>The report suggests a number of Premier League clubs have been impressed with his early-season form, who see him as a low-risk signing at the price quoted.</p>

      <h3>Baggies fans have their say</h3>
      <p>West Brom fans have been having their say on reports linking Pereira with a shock move to Old Trafford.</p>
      <p>It is widely expected that the Baggies will look to turn Pereira's loan deal into a permanent one in the coming months, but reports in the national press have claimed that there is also top-flight interest.</p>
      <p>Pereira’s parent club are already preparing for life without the midfielder.</p>
      <p>Reports in Portugal have claimed that the Baggies are expected to exercise their option to bring him to the Hawthorns permanently in January, with Sporting already planning what they will do with the funds they recoup.</p>
      <p>So what do Baggies supporters make of outside interest in one of their star loanees?</p>

      <p>Grady Diangana is set on staying with West Bromwich Albion, despite West Ham having the option to recall him in January.</p>
      <p>The 21-year-old has been an integral part of Slaven Bilic’s side as they have raced to the top of the Championship.</p>
      <p>An injury to Hammers forward Manuel  Lanzini had raised the possibility of Manuel Pellegrini recalling Diangana, serving as a cruel reminder of the Harvey Barnes situation of last January.</p>
      <p>But Pellegrini has hinted that he wants the youngster to stay with Albion’s promotion chasers and that feeling is mutual, according to Football Insider.</p>
