        <b>GET IT WRONG AND YOU'LL BE FIRED</b>
      </p>
      <p>Jose Anigo is still coming to terms with life in English football, just a few weeks after being appointed as <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a> ’s new head of international recruitment.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/jose-anigo">Anigo</a> , a former manager at French giants Marseille, admits the job is very different this side of the Channel, compared to what he’s been used to.</p>

        <b>SAMBA ON PROMOTION AND LIFE AT THE CITY GROUND</b>
      </p>
      <p>Making your debut in English football at Fulham could be seen as something of a baptism of fire for some.</p>
      <p>Those were the cards dealt to <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/brice-samba">Brice Samba</a> by his new manager at <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest</a> , Sabri Lamouchi, in late August, when the goalkeeper was handed his Championship debut at Craven Cottage.</p>

        <b>THE SECRET TO SABRI'S RELATIONSHIP</b>
      </p>
      <p>Last month Sabri Lamouchi called for Lewis Grabban to be more like Luis Suarez.</p>
      <p>Not necessarily the kind of aspirations you have for your player in all areas given Suarez's checkered record, but when it comes to scoring goals there are few better reference points.</p>
      <p>Grabban is <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/all-about/nottingham-forest-fc">Nottingham Forest's </a>best striker by some margin unless Rafa Mir has more to his game than he has had the chance to show yet, but Lamouchi wants more from his star man - <a href="https://www.nottinghampost.com/sport/football/football-news/nottingham-forest-sabri-lamouchi-grabban-3447545">he wants him to be 'a killer' in front of goal,</a> just like Barcelona's controversial scoring master Suarez.</p>

        <b>COULD COCU DEPART RAMS?</b>
      </p>
      <p>Phillip Cocu could become of interest to Feyenoord next summer, according to reports in the Netherlands.</p>
      <p>Frank Arnesen has been appointed the Rotterdam side's new sporting director and Dutch media outlet <a href="https://www.volkskrant.nl/sport/frank-arnesen-de-nieuwe-technisch-directeur-van-feyenoord-die-voor-een-cultuuromslag-moet-zorgen~b2fd5838/?referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.derbycounty.news%2Fnews%2Ffeyenoord-could-reportedly-come-in-for-derby-county-boss-phillip-cocu-next-summer-amid-close-links%2F">de Volkskrant</a> reckon he could make a move for the Derby County boss.</p>
