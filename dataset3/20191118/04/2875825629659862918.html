      <p>He revealed all on Extra Camp - and said the news couldn't have gone down any worse.</p>
      <p>The presenter didn't name names but said there was plenty of off camera swearing as the stars grumbled about being chucked in at the deep end.</p>
      <p>Appearing on the the ITV2 spin-off show alongside Ant, <a href="https://www.irishmirror.ie/all-about/declan-donnelly">Declan Donnelly</a> says he is glad he ducked telling the camp-mates about the watery blow coming their way.</p>

      <p>I just gave the news and walked off - there was quite a lot of bitching, believe me!</p>
      <p>"But to be fair, they eventually just got in and got on with it."</p>
      <p>Dec joked: "I'm glad Ant revealed that... I would have given in and said 'don't worry, you don't have to do it'."</p>
