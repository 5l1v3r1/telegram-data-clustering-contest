      <p><b><i>Marjaavaan </i>Box Office Day 3 Early Trends:</b> Starring Sidharth Malhotra, Tara Sutaria and Riteish Deshmukh in lead, <i>Marjaavaan</i> hit the theatre screens last Friday and received a mixed response from the audience. Its run at the box office had started at a decent note too, but the good news is that the Milap Zaveri directorial has witnessed a jump in its Day 3 collections.</p>
      <p><i>Marjaavaan</i> added <b>7.21 crores</b> to its box office collections, adding up to a total of <b>14.24 crores</b> till Saturday. Now, the movie has witnessed a jump of around <b>30%</b> and if the early trends are to be taken into consideration, it has added another <b>8.50-9.50 crores</b> to its kitty. This indeed is a celebration call, considering the massive competition this Sidharth Malhotra starrer has been facing from Ayushmann Khurrana’s <i>Bala</i>.</p>

      <p>The overall collections of <i>Marjaavaan</i> will now stand in the range of <b>22.74-23.74 crores.</b> Now with the initiation of the week, it is now to be seen whether the movie will continue its momentum, or will it witness a fall.</p>
      <p>Sidharth Malhotra says he is happy that people have accepted him as an action hero once again with <i>Marjaavaan.</i></p>
      <p>‘<i>Ek Villain</i>‘ and <i>‘Brothers’</i> introduced me as an action hero. I did not cater to this audience and today I am happy that they have given this kind of response to ‘Marjaavaan’,” Sidharth said.</p>
      <p>In <i>Marjaavaan,</i> Sidharth plays a larger-than-life hero who breaks bones and utters dialogues that reminds of the Angry Young Man image of Bollywood’s retro era. He plays a hotheaded young man who falls in love with a girl who cannot speak.</p>
      <p>The Milap Zaveri-directed <i>Marjaavaan</i> also features Tara Sutaria, Riteish Deshmukh and Rakul Preet Singh.</p>
