      <p>Honor V30 shows up on Vmall for early registration<br/>1 (20%) 1 vote</p>
      <p>Huawei sub-brand Honor is now accepting pre-registration for the upcoming flagship Honor V30<a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/12/honor-v30-series-finally-launching-on-november-26/"> just days ahead of its official launch in China</a>. Interested fans can register their interest via <a href="https://msale.vmall.com/honorv30.html?cid=104780">Vmall online</a> store beginning from today till November 26. With the registration, Honor says you will be able to partake in the V30 debut sale, which perhaps, will happen on or a day after the official launch in China.</p>
      <p>The listing doesn’t offer anything significant, however, it does confirm it will come with the standard “NSA and SA dual-mode 5G”. According to previous information, the Honor V30 series will be equipped with the Kirin 990 5G SoC. And aside from the 5G connectivity, Honor had earlier confirmed the Honor V30 will come with the much talked about “Matrix Camera” technology. Details of the so-called Matrix camera tech are still not in the open, though there are speculations it could create a new mobile photography experience for long and close-range dual recording, with the help of multiple lenses and AI ​​artificial intelligence algorithms.</p>

      <p>Designwise, the V30 as per an official teaser released earlier this month should come with a dual punch-hole screen with minimal bezels on all sides, while its rear design is reminiscent of the upcoming Galaxy A51. But unlike the alleged A51 with a Quad Camera setup, the V30 Pro design reveals a triple camera at the top-left position. The three cameras are stacked vertically, with the LED flash beside them forming an L-shaped design.</p>
      <h3>Honor V30 Camera details</h3>
      <p>Honor has yet to reveal the camera details. But there are reports the HonorV30 could come with a 60MP main camera sensor, which could use Sony’s latest IMX686 sensor, while the V30<a href="https://www.gizchina.com/2019/11/17/honor-v30-will-also-be-available-in-a-pro-version/"> Pro will also get the same sensor</a>, but with three pother sensors amounting to a Quad-camera setup for the Honor V30 Pro. We are not sure what the display size is for both devices, but there are speculations the brand will employ an LCD punch-hole screen and an OLED screen for the standard V30 and the Pro variant respectively.</p>
