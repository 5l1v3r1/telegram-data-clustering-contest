      <h1>HK actress Jacqueline Wong’s Instagram post has fans guessing what her future plans are</h1>

      <p>KUALA LUMPUR, Nov 18 - An Instagram post by Hong Kong actress Jacqueline Wong has raised questions about her future plans.</p>
      <p>In a post that was put up Friday, Wong thanked those involved in the production of television series <i>Finding Her Voice.</i></p>
      <p>The last episode was aired on Friday (November 15).</p>
      <p>What raised eyebrows was a quote in the caption where she bid farewell to her character in the show.</p>
      <p>“Thank you Ah Nam. Thank you to the team of Finding Her Voice. Goodbye Bai Xue Er,” wrote Wong in the post.</p>
      <p>Attached with the post were two pictures. </p>
      <p>One was of Wong with her co-star Owen Cheung while the second picture was of the series’ other cast.</p>
      <p>Some internet users read the post as Wong’s way of bidding farewell to the entertainment industry while others think she wanted to maintain her exposure rate.</p>
      <p>“This is to ensure she gets to return to acting,” <i>Sin Chew Daily</i> reported.</p>
      <p>Wong, who was caught kissing Hong Kong actor and singer Andy Hui in a taxi earlier this year, has been quiet after the scandal. </p>
      <p>It was previously reported that the 30-year-old Wong had gone to the United States after the controversy.</p>
      <p>She only returned to her Instagram account last week after keeping quiet on social media for seven months.</p>
      <p>The 30-episode <i>Finding Her Voice</i> is one of TVB’s special anniversary series and started airing from October 7, although Wong was not part of the promotional activities.</p>
      <p>Recently, TVB further softened their stance on Wong and announced two series — <i>Maid Alliance</i> and <i>Offliners</i> ― will begin screening in Malaysia on November 18 and December 16 respectively.</p>
