      <p>Motorola’s flip phone heritage has come screaming back into relevance with the futuristic folding phone format beginning to arrive on the consumer market. </p>
      <p>For those that fondly recall their time with the sleek and slim <a href="https://www.techradar.com/au/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/motorola-razr-v3-the-greatest-phone-of-all-time-1294669">Motorola Razr V3</a> from 15 years ago, the company has rewarded nostalgics with the announcement of a foldable reboot in the same form factor.</p>
      <p>Despite its name, the <a href="https://www.techradar.com/au/reviews/motorola-razr-2019">Motorola Razr 2019</a> won’t be available in the US until January 2020, where it’ll cost US$1,500, and now we know that it will be at least sharing that same release month with Australia.</p>
      <p>Motorola’s APAC GM of sales, Danny Adamopoulos, revealed the details on Australian availability <u>in conversation with 2GB</u> [as reported by <u>Gizmodo</u>]. "It will also be coming on sale in Australia in January, but you'll have to wait and see on the local pricing and who's going to take it," Adamopoulos said.</p>

      <p>As mentioned, the Motorola Razr 2019 follows the same format as the original Razr, with a clamshell flip design that instead opens up to reveal a 6.2-inch P-OLED display that covers the majority of the interior.</p>
      <p>In order to get the handset as thin as it needed to be, this foldable isn’t necessarily packing the latest smartphone tech – Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 710 CPU is at the centre of everything, and a rather small 2,510mAh battery powers the phone.</p>
      <p>You’ll get some other modern features that weren’t present on the original handset 15 years ago, such as a fingerprint scanner, 16MP primary camera, USB-C port, and NFC, although using an eSIM in place of a traditional SIM card slot may be problematic for some Aussie carriers. </p>
