      <p><b>DENVERÂ (AP)</b> - A Denver radio host says he was fired from a conservative station after criticizing President Donald Trump.</p>
      <p>The Denver Post reported that Craig Silverman says he was fired in the middle of his show on news and talk radio station 710 KNUS Saturday.</p>
      <p>Silverman says he was interrupted during a segment about former Trump personal attorney Roy Cohn that included critical remarks about the president.</p>
      <p>He says the broadcast was interrupted by a network news report before the station's program director entered the studio and said, "You're done."</p>
      <p>The former Denver chief deputy district attorney hosted "The Craig Silverman Show" for more than five years.</p>
      <p>The web page for Silverman's show has been removed from the station's website.</p>
      <p>KNUS representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
