      <p><a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/russia">Russian</a> troops took over the Kobani airfield in northern <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/conflicts/syria">Syria</a> last week, one day after U.S. troops moved out, according to a report.</p>
      <p>Russian state media showed the Russian flag flying over what had been the center for U.S. operations against <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/terrorism/isis">ISIS</a> in the region, CBS News reported Saturday.</p>

      <p>Other images showed Russian military helicopters landing on a runway and Russian troops deploying around the base, the report said.</p>
      <p>The airbase is located along Syria’s northern border with <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/turkey">Turkey</a>.</p>
      <p>The border region has been hit by several explosions that have killed and wounded scores of people over the past month, since Turkey began a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/world/erdogan-threatens-kurds-syria-turkey-cease-fire">military operation against Kurdish fighters</a> in the wake of President <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/category/person/donald-trump">Trump</a>'s decision to withdraw American troops from the area.</p>
      <p>On Saturday, a car bomb exploded in al-Bab, a town in Aleppo province that is controlled by Turkey-backed opposition fighters. The blast killed at least 18 people and wounding several others, Syrian opposition activists and Turkey’s Defense Ministry said.</p>
      <p>Last Wednesday, Russian officials said they had opened a helicopter base in Qamishli, about 200 miles east of Kobani, also along the border with Turkey, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russian-troops-take-command-of-us-airbase-kobani-northern-syria-2019-11-17/">CBS reported</a>.</p>

      <p>Two days earlier, Qamishli was the site of three bomb explosions that killed five people and wounded 26, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-syria-security-qamishli/bomb-attacks-kill-five-injure-dozens-in-syrias-qamishli-forces-idUSKBN1XL25S">according to Reuters</a>.</p>
      <p>Security forces in the largely Kurdish-controlled city described the bombings as a “terrorist operation,” the report said.</p>
