      <p>The mum of a man who lay dead in his flat while it was sealed up by a council has hit out at the charges she was forced to pay for his<a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/funerals"> funeral</a>.</p>
      <p>Michael Stewart, 32, was last seen alive on January 7.</p>
      <p>Later that month, ­neighbours noticed the door lock was broken and reported it and a month later a joiner padlocked his flat in ­<a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/aberdeen-city-council">Aberdeen</a>’s notorious Balnagask Estate.</p>
      <p>Michael’s body was found in the flat eight weeks later by <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/all-about/police">police</a>.</p>
      <p>Now mum Jane Grant has hit out at Aberdeen City Council for the level of fees she was charged for his funeral and burial costs as she believes they ­contributed to the stress she’s had over his death.</p>

      <p>The 52-year-old of ­Littleborough, Lancashire, said: “I am now finished paying all the cost of my son’s funeral and headstone which was a struggle ­financially but I wanted him to get the best send-off I could give him, even though it was tough.</p>
      <p>In my opinion, the council should have paid for every mistake they have made in regards to my son but I got through it and got it paid.”</p>
      <p>Jane has now set up a GoFundMe page to help with the costs.</p>
      <p>Michael had epilepsy, which Jane says the council was aware of.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>She says he also had alcohol issues and a social worker was meant to be helping.</p>
      <p>Among the bills Jane had to pay was one from the city for £875 for the ­certificate of right of burial and £34 for the lair rights.</p>
      <p>Aberdeen City Council declined to comment.</p>
