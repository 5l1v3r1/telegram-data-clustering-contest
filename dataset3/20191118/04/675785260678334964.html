      <h1>Man City 'considering move' for Bayern Munich winger if Leroy Sane joins German club</h1>
      <h2>The Germany international was heavily linked with a move to Bundesliga during the summer</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T04:14:43+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 04:14</time> by <a rel="author">Hassan Rashed</a></address>
      <p>Manchester City are reportedly weighing-up a move for Bayern Munich winger Kingsley Coman, if the German champions sign Leroy Sane this summer.</p>
      <p>Sane was heavily linked with the Bundesliga giants over the summer, but a move failed to materialise after he was ruled out for seven months in August with an ACL injury.</p>
      <p>However, Bayern are still believed to be keen on signing the German international and could look to complete a transfer at the end of the season, once he has returned to full fitness.</p>
      <p>If the 23-year-old is able to complete a return to his homeland, <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11679/11862925/manchester-city-consider-kingsley-coman-as-leroy-sane-replacement">Sky Sports News</a> claims that City could look to bring Coman to the Etihad Stadium.</p>
      <p>According to the publication, the defending Premier League champions consider the France international to be an ideal replacement for Sane.</p>

      <p>City boss Pep Guardiola knows Coman well after working with the winger during his time in charge at the Allianz Arena.</p>
      <p>The 23-year-old, who has also had spells with Paris Saint-Germain and <a href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/all-about/juventus-fc">Juventus</a> , has made 139 appearances for Bayern in all competitions since initially joining the club on loan in 2015, scoring 28 goals.</p>
      <p>He has featured prominently for the Bundesliga outfit this season, playing in 16 games in all competitions and providing three goals and five assists.</p>
      <p>The German giants attempted to bolster their wide options during the summer after the summer departures of Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery.</p>

      <p>Although Bayern eventually signed Ivan Perisic and Philippe Coutinho - both on initial loan deals with options to buy - former boss Niko Kovac previously claimed in July that Sane was the club's "dream signing".</p>
      <p>Kovac told <i>Sport Bild</i> (via <a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11679/11769450/bayern-munich-working-hard-for-dream-signing-leroy-sane-says-head-coach-niko-kovac">Sky Sports</a> ): "Our bosses have shown him a clear plan. We are very focused, Leroy knows what to expect here, and when a player with such capacity comes to FC Bayern, he knows his job.</p>
      <p>"You can see that the transfer is not easy. But I know that our people are working very hard to make it happen. We will do everything to realise this transfer.</p>
      <p>"We all know that Leroy Sane is our dream player. The public knows that, we know that."</p>
