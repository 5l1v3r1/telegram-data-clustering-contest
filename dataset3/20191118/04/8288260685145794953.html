      <h3>Striker 'target' signs new contract</h3>
      <p><a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> have been one of several Premier League sides linked with a move for highly-rated Wigan Athletic youngster Joe Gelhardt.</p>
      <p>The 17-year-old - who has been fast-tracked into the Latics’ first team after impressing manager Paul Cook - has now signed a new deal with the Championship outfit.</p>
      <p>A report from Goal.com last month claimed Wolves , Liverpool, Everton and Leicester City were all interested in the striker.</p>
      <p>But despite that interest, Gelhardt has penned a new, long-term deal with the Latics, meaning that any prospective suitor would now need to offer a lot more cash for his services, with a reported £5m valuation attached to him.</p>

      <h3>Wolves close in on Buta deal</h3>
      <p>Wolves are closing in on an agreement for Royal Antwerp bull-back Aurelio Buta, according to reports.</p>
      <p>The 22-year-old has been linked with a number of top flight clubs, including Newcastle United and Watford after an impressive season in Belgium.</p>
      <p>The Sunday Mirror (via The Express) have claimed that Wolves are close to finalising a deal that will see him move to Molineux, initially on loan.</p>
      <p>Buta is seen as vital competition for Matt Doherty, with Adama Traore now being utilised in a more traditional attacking role.</p>

      <p>Wolves fans are having their say after Cristiano Ronaldo's 99th international goal helped Portugal secure their qualification for next summer's European Championship finals.</p>
      <p>The reigning European champions won 2-0 away to Luxembourg in group B to make sure they will be in the running to defend their title in 2020 - and there were a quartet of Wolves stars on the field by the end of the game.</p>
      <p>Rui Patricio played the full 90 minutes in goal, while Ruben Neves, Joao Moutinho and <a href="https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/all-about/diogo-jota">Diogo Jota</a> all came off the bench.</p>
      <p>It was Jota's involvement that got Wolves supporters talking in the immediate aftermath, as the forward came close to registering his first goal for Portugal's senior side with a close-range chance, only for captain Ronaldo to tap the loose ball home from barely a yard out in the 86th minute.</p>

      <h3>Ant, Dec and Carl</h3>
      <p>"Which one of them is it?”</p>
      <p>That's the bizarre question, Wolverhampton Wanderers legend Carl Ikeme has been asking after revealing a shock familial link with either Ant or Dec.</p>
      <p>The iconic TV duo tracked their family tree on a recent ITV show, which discovered both had ancestral roots in Ireland, with the pair even finding themselves distantly related.</p>
      <p>And now Ikeme, who has family in England and Nigeria, whom he represented at international level, has revealed he is a distant relative of either Anthony McPartlin or Declan Donnelly.</p>
