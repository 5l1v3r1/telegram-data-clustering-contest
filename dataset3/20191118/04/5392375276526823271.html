      <p>Xiaomi MIUI 11 third-batch coming to “really old” devices – See list here<br/>3.8 (76.67%) 24 votes</p>
      <p>The stable version of Xiaomi <a href="https://www.gizchina.com/tag/miui-11">MIUI 11</a> started rolling out in mid-October. While Xiaomi is preparing this update for more devices, it is also adding some new MIUI 11 features. As of now, 27 Xiaomi phones are receiving either the stable or beta version of MIUI 11 on top of Android 10. However, recent information shows that not all MIUI 11 versions are based on Android 10. Older Xiaomi devices will most likely receive this update but just not based on Android 10 for now. A few days ago, MIUI 11 arrived two years old Redmi 4. However, this update is on top of Android 7.1.2 which the company claim is classic and rare. Now, we have a list of older devices that will get the Xiaomi MIUI 11 update in the third batch</p>
