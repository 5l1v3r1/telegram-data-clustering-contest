      <h1>Rumour: Half-Life: Alyx is the next VR game from Valve, to be announced next month, releases in March 2020</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T04:43:01+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 04:43</time> by <a rel="author">John Papadopoulos</a></address>
      <p>Two days ago, we <a href="https://www.dsogaming.com/news/valves-next-game-and-elder-ring-to-be-shown-at-the-vide-games-award-2019/">informed</a> you about the possibility of seeing the next Valve VR game and Elden Ring next month. And it appears we were right. Earlier today, a leaker – who was also responsible for the DOTA Underlords leak – has revealed the first details about this game.</p>
      <p>Valve’s VR game will be called Half-Life: Alyx, will be announced at the Video Game Awards 2019, and targets a March 2020 release. Or at least that’s what the leaker claims.</p>
      <p>The leaker leaked a snippet from an interview between Geoff Keighley and two of Valve’s employees. We do know that Keighley and his team is currently rehearsing the VGA 2019, so this actually sounds plausible.</p>
      <p>According to the leak, Half-Life: Alyx started as a VR exploration game. Furthermore, Valve does not currently plan to release a more “<i>traditional</i>” version that PC gamers can play with the mouse and keyboard.</p>
      <p>What’s also interesting here is that Valve plans to create more games after Half-Life: Alyx. As one unnamed Valve employee claimed during the interview.</p>
      <blockquote>“Yeah, the engine is ready now. I think it’s like Robin says, we want to put this out and see how the world reacts to it before we make any concrete plans about what we do next.”</blockquote>
      <p>You can find the full Half-Life: Alyx leak <a href="https://pastebin.com/9rjrw8nC">here</a>. However, and as the title suggests, this is a rumour (at least for now). Therefore, take everything you just read with a grain of salt.</p>
