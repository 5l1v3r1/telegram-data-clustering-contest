      <p>Talking about the character Savitibai, director Om Raut told Bombay Times. “Savitribai Malusare is a very important character. She is a strong woman who stands behind her warrior husband. She is loving, homely, motherly, and is also Tanhaji’s strong support system in every aspect of his life. While he fights the war on the battlefield, Savitri manages the fort at home. We wanted an actor who could pull off the multi-faceted character effortlessly. When we narrated the part to Kajol, she liked it a lot. She has enacted the part beautifully, and it’s a treat to watch her on-screen.”</p>
      <p><i>Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior</i> which is also releasing in 3D is set to hit the big screens on January 10 and will be clashing with Deepika Padukone’s Meghna Gulzar directorial Chhapaak.</p>
