      <h2>Traditional Britain Group vice-president Gregory Lauder-Frost picked on 21-year-old Isadora Sinha.</h2>

      <p>A student has told of her torment after being racially abused on Facebook by the vile founder of a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/far-right-extremists-could-pose-20870031">far-right</a> group.</p>
      <p>Isadora Sinha, 21, was subjected to a torrent of slurs by Gregory Lauder-Frost, who has now lost an appeal against his conviction over the threats.</p>
      <p>The 67-year-old dad-of-two sent Isadora messages ordering her to “go home” and saying she had “no right to “be in our country or arguing with a superior race”.</p>
      <p>Further posts included: “As the KGB say, ‘we’ you on the list. Don’t get too comfortable.”</p>

      <p>The far-right troll was found guilty of racist abuse at Jedburgh Sheriff Court in July and fined £300. His appeal has now been refused.</p>
      <p>Lauder-Frost, of Mordington, Berwickshire is vice-president of Traditional Britain Group, which last year hosted European parties linked to neo-<a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/medal-nazi-bodyguard-who-took-18797010">Nazis</a>.</p>

      <p>Isadora told how the case made her fear her family, from Hong Kong, would never be treated as equals.</p>
      <p>She said: “Anyone reasonable who has their life threatened would feel that way, especially when it is based on a characteristic that cannot be changed like ethnicity.</p>

      <p>“Even though my family and I have integrated, contribute and have our lives here, we will never be viewed as equal citizens.</p>
      <p>"The defence lawyer asked questions in a manner that tried to twist the situation in a way to shift the blame on me for the racial abuse.</p>
      <p>“I am a proud and contributing British citizen who loves this country and culture.</p>
      <p>Lauder-Frost was convicted of behaving in a threatening or abusive manner likely to cause fear and alarm.</p>

      <p>He has resigned the chairmanship of his local community council.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/far-right-group-tory-links-13362615">Traditional Britain Group</a> said: “Mr Lauder-Frost is out of the country. The committee unanimously declared at their October meeting Mr Lauder-Frost will not be asked to resign.”</p>
      <p>Lauder-Frost was a member of the Conservatives’ Monday Club which the Tories severed its links with in 2001 due to its extreme views.</p>
      <p>Tory toff Jacob Rees-Mogg said he regretted speaking at one of the club’s dinners.</p>
