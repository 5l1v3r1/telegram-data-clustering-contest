      <p>Google Maps will soon begin testing a new feature that's more common to social networks like Facebook, rather than a maps app: <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/18/google-maps-tests-a-social-networking-feature-with-the-ability-to-follow-local-guides/">the ability to find and follow other users</a>. From a report:<i> In Google Maps' case, it's specifically rolling out the ability to follow top "Local Guides" -- its community members who actively review business and share to Google Maps photos and other knowledge as part of a larger rewards program. The Local Guides program launched in 2015 as a way to take on Yelp Elites by allowing the most active Maps contributors to earn status as a tastemaker of sorts for their own hometown. Guides write more in-depth business reviews and post photos in order to help other Google Maps users learn about the area.<br/><br/>In exchange, they receive a variety of perks, like early access to new features, exclusive local meetups, free access to Google services, discounts and coupons and more. Now, Google says, it's kicking off a pilot program that will allow Google Maps users in select markets to follow top Local Guides by clicking a new "Follow" button on these users' profile pages. By doing so, the Guides' recommendations will be surfaced for you when you're using Google Maps. In a new section on the "For You" tab in the app, you'll find the area recommendations from the Local Guides. Google is piloting the program in Bangkok, Delhi, London, Mexico City, New York, Osaka, San Francisco, Sao Paulo and Tokyo, for the time being. Presumably, if all goes well, it would expand to more markets.</i> <b>Further reading</b>: <a href="https://tech.slashdot.org/story/18/11/16/1642259/google-maps-has-introduced-so-many-new-features-and-design-changes-in-recent-months-that-getting-directions-on-it-is-becoming-an-increasingly-challenging-task">Google Maps Has Introduced So Many New Features and Design Changes in Recent Months That Getting Directions On It is Becoming an Increasingly Challenging Task</a>; and <a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/2/8/11558788/ten-years-of-google-maps-from-slashdot-to-ground-truth">Ten Years of Google Maps, From Slashdot to Ground Truth</a> (2015).</p>
