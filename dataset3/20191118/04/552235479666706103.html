      <h2>The Daily Record says the SNP minister needs to start sorting out the chaos in NHS or make way for someone who can.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T04:30:00+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 04:30</time> by <a rel="author">Record View, https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/authors/record-view/</a></address>
      <p>Health Secretary Jeane Freeman is facing the toughest test of her political career.</p>
      <p>She has to answer for a health service rocked by serious allegations of <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/death-toddler-glasgow-super-hospital-20899713">hospital infections</a>, cover-ups and construction scandals.</p>
      <p>Last week, the Daily Record exposed shocking claims a <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/politics/heartbroken-mum-reveals-child-cancer-20889570">child in remission</a> from cancer died after picking up an infection from a hospital water supply in Glasgow’s new super-hospital.</p>
      <p>Today, Freeman can add to her list a damning report on staff shortages putting cancer survival at risk.</p>
      <p>And that’s not all of it.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>A children’s <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/death-5-month-old-baby-20899439">ward in Livingston</a> is not clinically safe to open as promised.</p>
      <p>A brand new children’s hospital in Edinburgh hasn’t <a href="https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/health/new-edinburgh-childrens-hospital-remain-18341552">opened at all.</a></p>
      <p>Unlike Westminster, the Scottish Parliament is still open for business during the General Election <br/>campaign.</p>
      <p>That means there can be absolutely no excuse for any distraction. None at all.</p>
      <p>The structural and management ­failings are not the fault of doctors, nurses and the wider NHS workforce.</p>
      <p>It would be wrong for a front-line medic to face public anger at ­management and government mistakes.</p>
      <p>Health boards and SNP ministers are in charge of funding and steering the NHS through ever more challenging circumstances, including the impact of damaging Tory austerity.</p>
      <p>But that’s where the party politics should end.</p>
      <p>Everyone in the country relies on a properly funded, competently managed NHS. The public are not getting what they deserve – and the health secretary needs to dramatically turn that around.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Tomorrow, when Holyrood starts its week, Freeman needs to stand up in front of parliament and show she ­understands just how bad this is getting.</p>
      <p>More than that, Freeman needs to clearly set out what she’s going to do about it.</p>
      <p>Patient confidence is paramount – and it has been sadly neglected.</p>
