      <h1>Saquon Barkley is biggest disappointment of lost Giants season</h1>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T04:16:47+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 04:16</time> by <a rel="author">Paul Schwartz</a></address>
      <p>When the schedule was released and the Giants learned their bye week would come so late — after 10 games — there was a sense the break would serve as a welcome respite before the stretch run.</p>
      <p>As it turns out, there is no stretch run forthcoming for the Giants. They are 2-8 and carry a six-game losing streak into their next game, Sunday in Chicago. The development of rookie quarterback Daniel Jones is ongoing and of great importance, and could lay the groundwork for him making a quantum leap forward in year No. 2. This season, though, is not only about Jones — who replaced Eli Manning after only two games — as there are glaring deficiencies in so many areas.</p>
      <p>The Giants have allowed an NFL-high 289 points and this mess cannot be blamed solely on the youth they put on the field. The offensive line, rebuilt again, has regressed after a decent start and the Giants might need two new tackles in 2020. The ballyhooed quartet of Saquon Barkley, Sterling Shepard, Golden Tate and Evan Engram did not take one snap together in the first 10 games and Shepard, after two concussions, might not play again this season.</p>
      <p>Rookie receiver Darius Slayton has been a pleasant surprise on a team with painfully few of them. For the seventh time in the past eight years, the Giants will fail to make the playoffs and the remaining home games are sure to take place in front of too many unoccupied gray seats.</p>
      <h3>Most Valuable Player</h3>
      <p>No one on the roster is having anything close to a Pro Bowl year and so the MVP though 10 games goes to outside linebacker Markus Golden. His 6.5 sacks are more than twice as many as the next defender and he has a fumble return for a touchdown. Golden has proven his surgically repaired knee is fine and he will command some nice money from the Giants or on the open market, as his contract is up after this season.</p>
      <h3>Least Valuable Player</h3>
      <p>Safety Antoine Bethea was a sixth-round draft pick way back in 2006 and put together a fine career, lasting 14 seasons, making three Pro Bowls and gaining immeasurable respect for his durability — the guy never misses a snap — and the way he comports himself. He has not had a strong first season with the Giants, getting beat deep too often and not exactly taking command on the back end. He has allowed 11 receptions on 14 targets, according to Pro Football Focus. Look for <a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/16/forgotten-giants-rookie-julian-love-is-itching-for-a-chance/">rookie Julian Love</a> to get thrown into the mix at Bethea’s expense.</p>
      <h3>Least Surprising Surprise</h3>
      <p>The inside linebacker position did not look like much of anything coming out of the summer. It does not look like much of anything now, either. There were no significant upgrades and, as a result, this is an area of great weakness. Alec Ogletree is not an impact player and the most promising newcomer, rookie Ryan Connelly, was lost in Week 4 to a knee injury. There’s a hole in the middle of the Giants defense.</p>
      <h3>Biggest Disappointment</h3>
      <p>It has to be Barkley. After 10 games as a rookie, Barkley had 728 rushing yards and 64 receptions. Ten games into this season, Barkley has 402 rushing yards and 33 receptions. Of course, he missed three games with a high ankle sprain and has not been right in the four games since his return. The entire offensive system is built around Barkley as a multi-faceted talent, too big and strong and fast for a defense to handle. He had 120 and 107 rushing yards the first two games and has not topped 72 since. It is a downer of a sophomore season thus far.</p>

      <h3>Best Moment</h3>
      <p>In Week 3, Jones made his first NFL start and with 1:16 remaining in a game the Giants trailed 28-10 at halftime, the Buccaneers defense split open like the Red Sea and Jones sprinted through that expanse for a 7-yard touchdown scramble that put the Giants ahead 32-31. When a Bucs field-goal attempt sailed wide right at the buzzer, the Giants had their first victory of the season and Jones was an instant (and, as it turned out, temporary) sensation.</p>
      <h3>Worst Moment</h3>
      <p>How long you got? There are so many to sort through. The lowest of the low has to come out of the worst loss of the season, getting beaten by the lowly Jets. The Giants were ahead 27-24 when on the first play of the fourth quarter, rookie DeAndre Baker was called for a 33-yard pass interference penalty to put the ball on the 1-yard line. The Jets got their winning points on the next play and the Giants were officially the Worst Team In New York.</p>

      <h3>Most Revealing Stat</h3>
      <p>Nothing determines winning and losing more decisively than turnover margin. The Giants are dead last in the NFL at minus-12. They have 12 takeaways on defense, but 24 giveaways on offense. The Giants lead the league with 14 lost fumbles — no player has more lost fumbles than Jones’ nine. Look no further to see why the Giants are where they are.</p>
      <h3>Worst Personnel Decision</h3>
      <p>Not having a viable third running back on the roster came back to haunt the Giants in a big way. Saquon Barkley (ankle) and Wayne Gallman (concussion) were out, yet the Giants were hanging in with the Patriots, down only 21-14 in the fourth quarter. That is when undrafted rookie Jon Hilliman lost a fumble that was picked up by linebacker Kyle Van Noy and returned for a touchdown. Hilliman should never have been in that position. A day later, he was waived.</p>
      <h3>Upcoming decision</h3>
      <p>Getting to five wins — to match the 2018 total — means winning three of the last six games, which is unlikely. So, if the Giants finish 2-14, 3-13 or 4-12, ownership must decide if Pat Shurmur is the right head coach to lead this team moving forward. No one upstairs wants to jettison Shurmur after just two years and that he is tethered to the development of Jones could be his saving grace.</p>
