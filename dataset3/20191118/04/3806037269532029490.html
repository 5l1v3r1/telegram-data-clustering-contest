      <h1>Colin Kaepernick Teases Possible Nike Air Force 1 Collaboration</h1>
      <h2>As seen on the NFL player during his private workout in Georgia.</h2>
      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T04:28:38+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 04:28</time> by <a rel="author">Sophie Caraan</a></address>
      <p><a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/colin-kaepernick">Colin Kaepernick</a> teased what might be his new collaboration with <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/nike">Nike</a> during a private workout in Riverdale, Georgia over the weekend. Prior to hitting the field with his <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/nike-vapor-untouchable-pro">Nike Vapor Untouchable Pro</a> cleats, the <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/nfl">NFL</a> free agent quarterback was spotted wearing an unrecognizable pair of <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/nike-air-force-1">Nike Air Force 1</a> Lows. Featuring a monochromatic color scheme, the reported collaborative model donned an all-black leather upper, a gradient panel swoosh outlined in white and what looked to be Kaepernick’s “K” logo replacing the Nike tongue tag. The iteration rests on a white midsole and icy translucent outsole, tied together with tonal black laces for a clean finish.</p>
      <p>Kap’s private workout was allegedly influenced by <a href="https://hypebeast.com/tags/jay-z">JAY-Z</a> as <a href="https://hypebeast.com/2019/11/jay-z-colin-kaepernick-private-nfl-workout">reports claim</a> that the multi-hyphenate “was involved in this and pushed this idea to some extent,” along with his hand in several social justice initiatives. The event featured on-field work and interview for the player, with all the NFL teams invited to attend.</p>
      <p>Stay tuned for more information on the rumored Colin Kaepernick x Nike collaboration.</p>
