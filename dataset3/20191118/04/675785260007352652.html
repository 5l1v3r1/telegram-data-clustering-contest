      <address><time datetime="2019-11-18T04:40:45+00:00">18 Nov 2019, 04:40</time> by <a rel="author">Matthew Dresch, https://www.mirror.co.uk/authors/matthew-dresch/</a></address>
      <p>A vicious brawl broke out at a Popeyes fast food branch just weeks after the company's new chicken sandwich sparked a wave of violent crimes.</p>
      <p>Seven Popeyes staff members were fired as a result of the scrap in Milwaukee, US, on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Scenes of violence have been recorded at Popeyes restaurants across America in recent weeks as customers scrambled to get their hands on the recently relaunched chicken sandwich.</p>
      <p>The latest fight took place at around 9.30pm, with male and female workers filmed hitting each other in the melee.</p>
      <p>Richard Fourte witnessed the scuffle after he went inside the outlet to avoid the long drive-thru queue.</p>

      <p>According to <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-7692979/Seven-Popeyes-workers-fired-massive-brawl-caught-camera.html">Mail Online</a> , he said: "I said to myself, I said, 'Wow, there's a lot of people working here.' I heard one of them yell, 'It's a fight'.</p>
      <p>"They ran to the back by the grills, OK. Now, there was a fight back there. I didn't get that one on tape.</p>
      <p>"Honestly, I wasn't even going to get the chicken sandwich."</p>

      <p>In the video, one of the employees can be seen climbing over the counter before striding towards another woman as they scream at each other.</p>
      <p>When the pair come face-to-face the other worker slaps her, sparking the brawl.</p>
      <p>Police were called to the restaurant although officers did not make any arrests.</p>
      <p>A spokesman for the Popeyes franchise owner said the outlet was closed after the fight and seven staff members were fired, including the manager on duty.</p>
      <p>It comes after Kevin Tyrell Davis, 28, of Oxon Hill, Maryland, US, was fatally knifed after he jumped the queue at Popeyes earlier this month, police say.</p>
      <p>Mr Davis was stabbed outside the branch 15 seconds after being confronted by another customer for cutting in line, reports say.</p>

      <p>At the time of the row, around three dozen people were queueing up at the restaurant, following the release of Popeyes hugely popular chicken burger.</p>
      <p>The £3.10 dish originally launched in August, however it sold out in two weeks and was only just reintroduced at the start of this month.</p>
      <p>Impatient customers were filmed ranting and fighting at Popeyes restaurants as they waited to get their hands on the burger.</p>
