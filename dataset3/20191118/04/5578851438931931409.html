        <b>Indian school children took to the streets on Sunday with a strong message.</b>
      </p>
      <p>"I am protesting for my right to breathe because it's completely taken away and I need to live. It's my right, you can't just take it away,” said Shaurya Vardhan, protesting school student.</p>
      <p>Schools in the capital New Delhi will reopen on Monday after closing for two days due to a spike in pollution levels, but air quality is likely to remain "very poor", just a notch below the most hazardous "severe" rating, raising health risks for millions of students.</p>
      <p>"This is affecting everybody. As a patient, as a doctor and as a family man, I am really concerned about it,” said Devendra Taneja, doctor and parent at protest.</p>
      <p>Toxic smoke choking the city has plunged air quality into the "severe" pollution category on several days this month, as data showed that a pledge by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to stamp out burning of crop stubble in neighboring states hasn't worked.</p>
