      <p>Arsenal return to Premier League action against Southampton after the international break.</p>
      <p>The 2-0 defeat to Leicester last week left the Gunners eight points adrift of the top four, but Unai Emery's side have the chance to bounce back against a struggling Saints team that have shipped 14 goals in their last three league games.</p>
      <p>Emery's future has been under scrutiny but the Arsenal head coach was recently given a vote of confidence by the Gunners hierarchy.</p>
      <p>Can he improve results to save his job? Or will the north Londoners be looking for a new coach by Christmas?</p>
      <p>Here's the latest stories doing the rounds from the last 24 hours.</p>

      <h3>Agent provides update on Lucas Torreira's Arsenal future</h3>
      <p>The agent of Arsenal midfielder Lucas Torreira has revealed that his client is not happy with his role at the Emirates Stadium this season.</p>
      <p>The midfielder has mostly been used as a substitute during the 2019/20 campaign, although he has been a regular pick in the Europa League, starting three of the four games so far.</p>
      <p>Torreira has however been named in the starting 11 for Arsenal's last two Premier League games, starting in the middle of the park for the matches against Wolves and Leicester, where the Gunners picked up one point from the 180 minutes.</p>
      <p>Before securing a move to the Emirates in summer 2018, Torreira was in negotiations with Italian side Napoli, and his agent Raffaele Bentancur has revealed just how close the Uruguayan came to moving to Napoli.</p>
