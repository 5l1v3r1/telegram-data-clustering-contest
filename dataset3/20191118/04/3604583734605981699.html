      <p>A PRE-CHRISTMAS boost means more primary school pupils will get a chance to tinker with the benefits of repairing damaged bikes for those most in need.</p>
      <p>A $32,000 grant for YMCA Ballarat will help ensure more wheels are ready to roll for the summer from its ReCranked in Schools project.</p>
      <p>YMCA Ballarat chief executive officer Brooke LeSueur said the funds would make a tremendous difference to the program and to the disadvantaged and at-risk children who take part in it.</p>
      <p>"We are now able to offer the ReCranked program at 10 primary schools in Ballarat and the western region," Ms Le Sueur said.</p>
      <p>"The ReCranked in Schools program delivers so many benefits to young people, including the opportunity to acquire new skills, build their confidence and actively participate in a new learning environment."</p>

      <p>The RACV Community Foundation grant comes as YMCA Ballarat appeals for old and unwanted bike donations for its workshop and shed to ensure they have a collection to repair and roll out before Christmas. Stocks are all-but-deplete.</p>
      <p>ReCranked in Schools supports primary school pupils in Ballarat to learn how to repair a recycled bike. The program helps children develop mechanical techniques, literacy and numeracy skills, cycling and leadership, teamwork and communication skills. It also promotes social connections with other participants and program leaders.</p>
      <p>RACV Community Foundation chose to focus on programs that aim to reduce social isolation across the state.</p>

      <p>YMCA Ballarat was among 15 organisations to share in the funding boost.</p>
      <p>Foundation chairman Graeme Chipp said such programs played a critical support role for young and old Victorians who might be experiencing loneliness.</p>
      <p>"We are proud to support initiatives, like Recranked in Schools that help build new skills and confidence and create a sense of belonging and purpose within young people and others in their communities," Mr Chipp said.</p>
