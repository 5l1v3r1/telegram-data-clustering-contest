        <b>What is ketosis</b>
      </p>
      <p>The keto diet has become one of the most followed diet fads, and the discipline is being adopted by more and more people with the passing of each day. The notion that it quickens the process of weight loss seems to have resonated well in the minds of people, and results do seem to show a positive impact. The keto diet is based on the state of ketosis, which is a metabolic state wherein the body converts <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/photo-stories/health-fitness/7-exercises-that-burn-stomach-fat-fast/photostory/29491765.cms">fat</a> reserves into energy instead of carbohydrates, thus burning fat more efficiently and at a faster rate.</p>
      <p>
        <b>The keto diet</b>
      </p>
      <p>The ketogenic diet consists of foods in which 75% of the calories are derived from fats, 20% from protein, and 5% from carbohydrates. Since most of the calories are obtained from fats, the body will enter a state of ketosis and end up burning more calories. There are many kinds of food that are included in a keto diet, such as animal products like eggs and chicken, dairy products like cottage cheese, and fruits like avocado. Today, we will look at 5 vegetables that you must include as a part of your keto diet.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Broccoli</b>
      </p>
      <p>Half a cup of broccoli has just 2 grams of net carbs, and a majority of the calories comes from protein and fats. It is loaded with nutrients and contains fiber, which helps you lose weight by keeping you full for longer.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Cauliflower</b>
      </p>
      <p>With just 1.5 grams of carbs in half a cup of cauliflower, it makes for an excellent low-carb addition to your keto diet. Moreover, it is rich in vitamin C and folic acid, so you get an extra boost of nutrients.</p>
      <p>
        <b>Mushrooms</b>
      </p>
      <p>One serving of mushrooms has 20 calories, and just 2 grams of net carbs and 3 grams of protein. The rest is all fat, so it works well to provide your body with the fat needed to be used as energy. It also packs a healthy dose of nutrients and even boosts immunity.</p>
