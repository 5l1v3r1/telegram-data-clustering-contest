      <p>Three people, including two young children, were shot with hunting rifles during the opening weekend of deer hunting season in Michigan.</p>
      <p>The first incident occurred on Friday when a man discharged his hunting rifle by accident inside his Crawford County home and fragments from the bullet pierced his two sons, ages 4 and 6, according to the <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2019/11/17/dad-rifle-injures-son-deer-hunting-opening-day/4221957002/">Detroit Free Press.</a></p>
      <p>The dad was attempting to place the firearm into its cover when it went off.</p>
      <p>Fragments from the bullet went through a wall and struck the siblings inside the kitchen. They were not seriously injured, the report said.</p>
      <p>The second shooting took place at about 5:30 p.m. Saturday when a 29-year-old man mistook his younger brother, 28, for a deer and accidentally shot him with a muzzle rifle in a Boston Township cornfield, according to the Ionia County Sheriffâ€™s Office.</p>
      <p>The duo got separated while searching for a deer and the older brother fired when he heard what he believed to be the animal moving around nearby.</p>
      <p>The elder sibling called 911 once he realized he hit his brother. The victim was airlifted to a nearby hospital in serious but stable condition.</p>
      <p>No arrests were made in either incident.</p>
